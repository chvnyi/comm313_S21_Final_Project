Trade war: Imports of U.S. products into China fell 22% in August compared to previous yearCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 8, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 448 wordsBody       China's trade with the United States fell dramatically in August as a tariff war escalated (AP Photo/Kin Cheung, Archive)China's trade with the United States fell dramatically as both sides prepared for further negotiations, with no evidence of progress to end a tariff war that threatens global economic growth.Imports of U.S. products fell by 22% in August compared to the previous year, to $10.3 billion, following tax hikes in China and orders to cancel orders, new customs data showed Sunday.Exports to the United States, China's largest market, sank by 16%, to $44.4 billion,under pressure by punitive tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on a pulse around the Beijing's trade surplus and its technological ambitions.Beijing is resisting pressure from the United States to relinque its efforts to create government-controlled firms capable of competing internationally in sectors such as robotics. The United States, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say these plans breach China's commitments to open its markets and rely on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to deliver their technology.Donald Trump and Xi Jinping depend on the scope of U.S.-China trade conflictTariff hikes that have crossed China and the United States worth billions of dollars have affected trade in products such as soybeans or medical equipment, and hit operators on both sides.Chinese exporters are also under pressure for a decline in global consumer demand at a time when Beijing is urging them to seek other markets to replace the United States.U.S. and Chinese negotiators were preparing for a round of talks in October,later than originally planned, with no indication of concessions that could break the deadlock.Donald Trump with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting at the G20 summit in Osaka (Erin Schaff/The New York Times)Beijing asserts that tariffs against Chinese products must be lifted once an agreement enters into force. Washington says some must be maintained to ensure that Beijing delivers on the promises it makes.The Chinese government has agreed to reduce its trade surplus with the United States, but is reluctant to give up its development strategies, which it sees as a path to global prosperity and influence.Some analysts suggest that Beijinghe is capping the storm in the hope that Trump will be pressured to accept a more favorable deal as his campaign approaches re-election for 2020. Trump has warned that if re-elected, China will face a tougher U.S. negotiating strategy.With information from APMORE ON THIS THEME:Trade war: US and China to resume bilateral negotiations in OctoberWall Street suffers losses from escalating trade warLoad-Date: September 9, 2019End of Document

Last quarter, Alcoa reported at 16:10 ET, or 10 minutes after the close, so it should be around then.The street is looking for a Q3 loss of $(0.29) per share and revenue of $2.58 bln. Consensus for Adjusted EBITDA is approximately $369 mln for Q3 and for the full year consensus is at $1.68 bln. What's notable to us is that Alcoa has provided a full year Adjusted EBITDA outlook in the past. However, due to unprecedented market volatility, Alcoa has decided not to provide the guidance. While not providing specific Q3 guidance, Alcoa has said it expects benefits from higher volumes and lower costs for raw materials and maintenance in the Alumina and Bauxite segments. In the Aluminum segment, Alcoa expects improvements primarily from lower alumina costs. With the stock price having been cut in half over the past year, it's no secret that the aluminum market is struggling, driven by lower demand in both China and the world ex-China due to trade tensions and macro headwinds. The silver lining is that aluminum inventories continue to decline and are expected by year's end to reach levels not seen in more than a decade, since before the financial crisis in 2008. Nevertheless, Alcoa keeps lowering its aluminum demand outlook for 2019. It's now down to +1.25-2.25%, down from prior guidance of +2-3%, which had been lowered from +3-4%, predominantly due to lower demand growth in China and trade tensions generally. Alcoa has described a frustrating trend. Basically, there has been a consistent decline in global inventories over the last decade. However, aluminum prices have remained stubbornly unreactive thus far due to the volume of Chinese aluminum exports hitting the global market. On a final note, we mentioned the stock has been roughly cut in half over the past year as sluggish aluminum prices weigh on Alcoa. The good news is that the stock has somewhat stabilized since early June, which is hopefully an indication a lot of the negativity is already priced in. Investors will want to hear Alcoa's outlook for 2020 as hopefully there are early signs of improvement.13:38COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $9.50 (0.64%) at $1492.6/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.03 higher (0.17%) at $17.42/oz Dec copper settled $0.02 lower (0.77%) at $2.59/lb13:13SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: TEVA (29.02 mln +3.08%), ENDP (14.98 mln +22.64%), MNK (11.56 mln +6.25%), ACB (10.98 mln -1.73%)Materials: X (15.33 mln -4.99%), VALE (10.66 mln -1.62%)Industrials: GE (22.9 mln +0.9%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (28.16 mln -6.77%), ROKU (15.46 mln -0.01%), F (12.83 mln +0.66%)Information Technology: AMD (27.31 mln +1.14%), NOK (12.58 mln +1.6%), MSFT (11.07 mln -1.15%), AAPL (10.94 mln -0.7%)Financials: BAC (54.04 mln +2%), QQQ (11.19 mln -0.41%), WFC (10.22 mln -1.07%)Energy: CHK (33.16 mln -1.49%), MDR (10.65 mln +14.55%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: RYTM (6.14x +1.68%), ASMB (5.77x +29.19%), PRQR (5.76x +3.22%), RETA (2.72x +5.31%), ATNX (2.15x -8.61%), AUPH (1.89x +7.82%)Industrials: CUB (2.41x +7.22%), AJRD (1.93x +2.25%)Consumer Discretionary: SNBR (3.32x -1.56%), FCAU (2.28x +1.05%)Information Technology: TECD (3.83x +13.98%), WDAY (3.59x -12.55%), PAGS (2.58x -2.64%)Financials: ESGD (12.09x +0.08%), NHF (5.3x -1.97%), RBS (2.21x +1.55%), EIM (2.12x +0.23%)Consumer Staples: NBEV (2.49x +19.71%)Utilities: NGG (2.02x +0.45%)13:11SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ASMB (12.02 +29.19%), ENDP (4.28 +22.64%), INO (2.45 +9.15%), AUPH (5.04 +7.82%), UBX (7.32 +6.86%), IMMU (15.35 +6.67%), MNK (2.21 +6.25%)Materials: AG (9.76 +6.15%), SBGL (6.58 +5.96%)Industrials: CUB (74 +7.22%), GVA (35.05 +7.14%)Consumer Discretionary: TEN (12.94 +7.97%), TLRD (4.39 +5.88%)Information Technology: TECD (126.9 +13.98%), FIT (3.8 +10.14%)Energy: MDR (2.52 +14.55%), SPN (0.52 +14.26%), REI (1.61 +7.33%), NBR (1.86 +6.9%)Consumer Staples: NBEV (3.28 +19.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.55 -11.01%), NTRA (35.82 -8.67%), ATNX (10.14 -8.61%), APHA (5.03 -7.33%)Materials: RYAM (4.23 -10%), TMST (5.33 -7.63%)Consumer Discretionary: ASNA (0.47 -6.9%), NIO (1.45 -6.77%)Information Technology: WDAY (158.25 -12.55%), COUP (140.74 -9.02%), APPN (45.93 -8.74%), NOW (251.17 -8.41%), AVLR (68.26 -8.05%), MDB (124.15 -7.97%), PLAN (43.99 -7.95%), AYX (103.5 -7.78%), WK (41.72 -7.68%), SPLK (112.36 -6.25%), DQ (40.8 -6.23%)Consumer Staples: RAD (8.6 -6.68%)13:10PDCO Patterson Companies responds to Administrative Law Judge recommendation, does not anticipate that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations (17.40 +0.08)12:59TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to report overnight (50.76 +0.37)Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 50.76, +0.37, +0.7%) will report its Q3 results overnight, followed by management's conference call tomorrow at 2:00 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the contract chip manufacturer to report a 7.9% yr/yr increase in EPS to TWD3.71 on a 9.8% yr/yr increase in revenue to TWD285.80 bln. TSM has had a very good showing since the release of its Q2 results on July 18. The stock has surged 22% since then, having climbed nearly 15% over the past month. The semiconductor industry has not fully recovered from the sharp slowdown at the end of 2018, but TSM has been able to withstand that weakness due in part to its size as well as expectations for an imminent rebound in activity. Most recently, shares received a boost from reports of stronger than expected sales of the iPhone 11, which imply increased production of components. TSM reportedly expects that global shipments of 5G smartphones will reach 300 mln units in 2020. Last quarter, the company reported a slight decrease in inventory, which reached a record during Q1. Additional progress on inventory reduction would go a long way toward justifying the recent rally.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing trades at 20.9x forward earnings expectations.12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks trade mixed; investors weigh macro, earnings newsThe stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.12:42EXC Exelon underperforming after sudden retirement of CEO of Exelon Utilities unit amid federal into lobbying activities (45.87 -1.19)Last night, the company announced that it has appointed Calvin G. Butler Jr., CEO of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company ("BGE"), as Interim CEO of Exelon Utilities, effective immediately. This appointment follows the retirement of Anne Pramaggiore, Senior Executive Vice President and CEO of Exelon Utilities, which is also effective immediately.

Velazquez, CEO of Pepco Holdings -- will report to Mr. Butler. In addition, Exelon Utility CEO staff heads Val Jensen, Carim Khouzami and Mike Kormos will also report to Mr. Butler moving forward. Earlier this month, the company disclosed that it received a second grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois that requires production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities, including Illinois State Senator Martin Sandoval:As previously disclosed, Exelon Corporation and Commonwealth Edison Company (the "Companies") received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, which required production of information concerning lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. On October 4, 2019, the Companies received a second grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois that requires production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities, including Illinois State Senator Martin Sandoval. "The Companies have cooperated fully with the U.S. Attorney and intend to continue to cooperate fully and expeditiously with any government requests or inquiries. On June 21, 2019, the Exelon Corporation Board formed a Special Oversight Committee, consisting solely of independent directors, to oversee the Companies' cooperation and compliance with the subpoena, any further action taken by the U.S. Attorney and any resulting actions that may be required or recommended. The Special Oversight Committee has engaged independent outside counsel to advise and assist the Committee."According to The Chicago Tribune, Pramaggiore is reportedly a focus of the ongoing federal probe.Following the developments, Mizuho (Neutral rated) lowered their price target from $49 to $47 and cautioned that "[p]otential grand jury indictments of Exelon lobbyists in the Madigan/Sandoval investigations could derail attempts by the company to obtain passage of legislation in Illinois next year."12:07COMM Commscope: German Federal Patent Court has issued decisions upholding the validity of important CommScope patents that had been challenged by a competitor, COMLAB (11.51 +0.18)At an October 9 oral hearing, the German Federal Patent Court rejected challenges by COMLAB regarding the validity of the German part of European Patent EP1022849B1 (Action No. 5 Ni 6/17 (EP)) owned by CommScope's affiliate Andrew Wireless Systems.

Recall that last quarter IBM's largest segment by sales, Global Technology Services, reported a 6.7% decline to $6.8 bln. Obviously, the segment is a focal point purely based on size alone, but the troubles weren't just last quarter. In Q1 the GTS segment saw revenue declines of 7%.IBM steps into the Q3 report with a $126 bln market capitalization and trades at about 11.5x forward earnings estimates.12:03SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Achillion Pharma (ACHN) rises on all-cash acquisition deal -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersACHN (6.25 +71.23%): To be acquired by Alexion (ALXN) for an all-cash initial consideration of approx. $930 mln, or $6.30/share; potential additional contingent considerations, which hinge on clinical and regulatory developments such as FDA approval of danicopan and ACH-5228 Phase 3 initiation, could elevate the amount payable to co's shareholders to $8.30/share. Alexion looks forward to applying its "development expertise" to co's oral Factor D inhibitors in an endeavor to unlock the approach's potential and deliver benefits to patients. The stock moves to its highest levels in almost three years. ENDP (4.22 +20.91%): Touched up to three-month highs on higher than average volume; drug manufacturers generally outperform today in concert with reports that various sector names (JNJ, ABC, MCK, CAH, TEVA...) have made proposals regarding or are in talks concerning settlement of opioid litigation. AUPH (5.13 +9.85%): Continued strength; co today reported that the last patient study visit has occurred in the AURORA Phase 3 lupus nephritis study of voclosporin; efficacy and safety results from the study remain on-track to be reported by the end of the fourth quarter, and co anticipates that disclosure of the results will be "followed by the necessary preparations to submit an NDA for voclosporin during the first half of 2020." The AURORA II continuation study is also reportedly progressing as planned.Small Cap LosersAPHA (4.99 -8.1%): After moving higher by circa 25% yesterday following its Q1 earnings report. The cannabis sector generally cools off. ATNX (10.17 -8.3%): Drops to new five-month lows on higher than average volume. The stock has now moved lower by circa 16% month-to-date and trades lower by more than 50% from its July highs. NIO (1.46 -5.81%): Declines on moderately high volume; items of interest for co and the EV space this week have included Chinese new energy vehicle sales results for September and rumors from a reporting source in China that co was in talks regarding a factory investment.12:02PS Pluralsight (+2.7%) bucking weakness among software stocks after hiring former Salesforce (CRM) CIO, and then EVP of N.A. sales Ross Meyercord as Chief Revenue Officer (16.97 +0.46)The stock is down more than 40% since missing billings estimates and guiding down third quarter revenue, citing sales execution issues.11:44CSX CSX to report this evening (68.90 -0.27)Rail carriers CSX (CSX 68.90, -0.27, -0.4%) and Union-Pacific (UNP 163.73, +0.59, +0.4%) will report their Q3 results between today's closing bell and tomorrow's open. CSX will report this evening, followed by management's conference call at 16:30 ET, while Union-Pacific's report will be released tomorrow morning, followed by a conference call at 8:45 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects CSX to report a 2.9% yr/yr decrease in EPS to $1.02 on a 4.7% yr/yr decrease in revenue to $2.98 bln. The Capital IQ consensus expects Union-Pacific to report a 7.4% yr/yr increase in EPS to $2.31 on a 4.7% yr/yr decrease in revenue to $5.65 bln. Both rail carriers are among the 20 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Another DJTA component, J.B. Hunt Transportation Services (JBHT 114.99, +3.39, +3.0%) reported weaker than expected Q3 EPS yesterday, coupled with slightly better than expected revenue. CSX trades about 15% below its record high from May while UNP is about 10% below its own record from August. Like JBHT, CSX and UNP are likely to lament the current operating environment, considering weekly Rail Traffic reports from the Association of American Railroads have consistently pointed to yr/yr declines in traffic between 5% and 10%. September saw yr/yr carload decreases in 14 out of 20 commodity categories after 12 out of 20 commodity categories showed yr/yr declines in August. CSX was downgraded to Neutral at JPMorgan on October 4 while UNP was upgraded to Overweight at Atlantic Equities. UNP CFO reaffirmed the company's guidance for FY19 operating ratio below 61% on September 4. The CFO did note that the company now expects volume in the second half of 2019 to decline in the mid-single digits while previous guidance called for a decrease of about 2%.CSX trades at 15.8x forward earnings expectations while UNP trades at 16.9x forward estimates.11:38SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACHN, ACM, ARNC, ASC, ATKR, BHE, BLD, BLDR, BMCH, BZH, CASH, CBPO, CCS, CELG, CHTR, CNS, DE, DEA, DLTR, DOCU, IBP, INFO, INXN, IRT, JBL, KBH, KN, KOD, KSU, LBRDK, LEN, LGIH, MAS, MDC, MTH, MTZ, NFBK, ODFL, PHM, RETA, SHW, SNX, TECD, TMCX, TMHC, TPH, VICI, WD, WMSStocks that traded to 52 week lows: DERM, DT, FLDM, GTYH, HEP, ICUI, LBRT, LNDC, PRQR, RVLV, SSTI, TACO, TEUM, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: DCOM, PDFSThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: BSTC, FULC, NGVC, NPK, RMNIETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWT, ITB, PALL, PSK, XHB11:35Events and Conferences TomorrowImage Sensors Auto Americas 2019 (Oct 17-18)Scheduled to appear: INFO, XLNX, LYFT, SNEPMA Fresh Summit Conference & Expo 2019 (Oct 17-19)Scheduled to appear: AGFSAmong company updates: Sanderson Farms (SAFM) investor day at 20:30 ET11:30DT Dynatrace (-4%): Recent IPO falls to record low as software stocks come under pressure following tepid Workday (WDAY -12%) Analyst Day (17.41 -0.79)11:28XLF Money Center Comparables- Morgan Stanley reports tomorrow before the market opensMorgan Stanley will report earnings tomorrow before the open with a conference call to follow at 8am ET.Current Capital IQ consensus stands at EPS of $1.12 (-4% yr/yr), Net Income at $1.80 bln (-10% yr/yr), on Revenues of $9.63 bln (-2% yr/yr).MS results will be compared to peers.

The two seem to be canceling each other out to a large extent, which is keeping the major indices in check.The outsized moves have been reserved for individual stocks with news, like Bank of America (BAC 30.45, +0.72, +2.4%) and United Airlines (UAL 90.08, +2.20, +2.5%), both of which reported better than expected earnings results. Accordingly, there hasn't been a lot of movement at the sector level.Seven sectors are up and four are down, with changes ranging from a 0.6% decline (information technology) to a 1.0% increase (materials).In terms of the macro hangups, they include the weaker-than-expected retail sales numbers for September, reports that a Brexit deal compromise between the EU and UK might not come to fruition before the Oct. 31 deadline, and misgivings about the completion of the "phase one" trade deal with China.The latter has stemmed from news that the U.S. House passed measures that support the Hong Kong protesters, which prompted a warning from China that it will respond with countermeasures if the U.S. Senate also passes those measures and the legislation ultimately becomes law.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are flat; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%.10:03VRRM Verra Mobility to acquire Pagatelia; terms not disclosed (13.99 -0.03)Pagatelia is a European leader in electronic tolling throughout Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy.

The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted.

In Study 202 (Rx nave patients), greater mean log10 declines in HBV DNA (5.27 vs 3.99; p=0.017) and RNA (2.34 vs 0.61; p<0.001) were achieved with 731+Nrtl (entecavir) versus entecavir alone. In Study 201 (Nrtl-suppressed patients), the proportion of patients on 731+Nrtl versus Nrtl alone achieving DNA target not detected (TND) was 69% vs 0% (p<0.001), and the proportion of patients achieving RNA <35 U/mL whose RNA was less than 35 U/mL at baseline was 52% vs 0% (p=0.0013) respectively. In Study 211, there are 64 HBeAg+ patients currently on extended treatment beyond 24 weeks. Among the 27 HBeAg+ patients receiving 731+Nrtl in Study 201, 41% (11/27) have now achieved DNA TND along with RNA <35 U/mL and HBeAg <1 IU/mL. At their last timepoint, Study 202 patients now in Study 211 (n=22) have demonstrated mean DNA and RNA declines of 6.1 and 3.0 logs, respectively, with observed mean log changes of more than or equal to 0.6 for HBeAg (11 patients more than or equal to 0.5, 4 patients more than or equal to 1.0), >0.8 log for HBcrAg (7 patients more than or equal to 1.0, 3 patients more than or equal to 2.0) and more than or equal to 0.4 log for HBsAg (7 patients more than or equal to 0.5, 3 patients more than or equal to 1.0). 731 continues to exhibit a favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients treated for up to 1 year, with only mild/moderate adverse events and lab abnormalities, and only a single discontinuation due to a Grade 1 rash. The combination of 731+NrtI results in faster and deeper declines in HBV DNA and RNA than NrtI alone, as well as subsequent declines in the surrogate markers of cccDNA (pgRNA, HBeAg and HBcrAg) predictive of cccDNA pool depletion, and HBsAg. The emergent data supports the continued development of 731. ABI-H2158 -- The Second-Generation Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Core Inhibitor (CI) ABI-H2158 is Associated with Potent Antiviral Activity in a 14-Day Monotherapy Study in HBeAg-positive Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)Abstract Summary: The Phase 1b study is enrolling sequential cohorts of 9 patients and each cohort will be randomized to receive 2158 or placebo (7:2) QD for 14 days in a blinded manner. Dosing in the 1st cohort (100 mg) has been completed. In patients receiving 2158, mean declines from Baseline to Day 15 in HBV DNA and RNA levels were 2.3 log10 IU/mL [range 1.7 -- 3.0] and 2.1 log10 IU/mL [range 1.5 - 2.7] respectively. No serious AEs, dose limiting toxicities or premature discontinuations were reported. Three patients reported a total of 5 mild, drug-related AEs that recovered without intervention; dizziness, fatigue, rash, headache and upper abdominal pain. Treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities were infrequent, mild and transient, with no ALT elevations Grade more than or equal to 1 in severity. Day 14 plasma 2158 Cmax and AUC0-24hr were 3,390 ng/mL and 46,100 hr*ng/mL, respectively. Results from the initial 100 mg low dose of ABI-H2158 cohort demonstrated potent antiviral activity, a favorable safety profile when administered for 14 days, and support once daily dosing in CHB patients.07:43PAG Penske Auto increases quarterly dividend to $0.41/share from $0.40/share (45.08 )07:38ABT Abbott Labs reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q4 EPS in-line (81.98 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.84 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.84; revenues rose 5.5% year/year to $8.08 bln vs the $8.1 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus, and 7.6 percent on an organic basis including 3.8% in nutrition, 6.6% in diagnostics, 7.9% in established pharma and 10.6% in medical devices.

Results of underground drilling continuously extended the major mineralized vein structures along strike and downdip, and exploration tunneling exposed high-grade mineralization zones within major production vein structures.Highlights of selected drill hole intersections include:Hole ZKX11111 intersected a 1.34m interval from 135.86m to 137.20m, 0.97m true width, of vein LM17W1 grading 1,211 grams per tonne ("g/t") silver ("Ag"), 11.58% lead ("Pb"), and 0.92% zinc ("Zn") at the 634m elevation; Hole ZKX1302 intersected a 1.22m interval from 121.20m to 122.42m, 1.21m true width, of a new vein grading 661g/t Ag, 14.00% Pb, and 0.28% Zn at the 708m elevation; and Hole ZKX0513 intersected a 1.66m interval from 185.43m to 187.09m, 1.36m true width, of vein LM17W grading 859g/t Ag, 4.53% Pb, and 0.31% Zn at the 661m elevation.16:41GRTS Gritstone Oncology files for $250 mln mixed securities shelf offering (8.57 0.00)16:36NANO Nanometrics and Rudolph Technologies (RTEC) provide post-merger details - combined company will be named Onto Innovation and trade on NYSE under symbol ONTO; expected to close before the end of October (33.41 +0.73)16:34ETN Eaton to sell its lighting business to Signify for $1.4 bln in cash (82.18 +1.32)Co announces that it has entered into an agreement to sell its Lighting business to Signify N.V. for a cash purchase price of $1.4 bln.

This change in top line performance, coupled with lower factory absorption, higher operating expenses arising largely from acquisitions, and other factors, will adversely affect net income for the period. Thus, management expects that quarterly earnings per share are likely to be less than half of the [$0.23] consensus estimate and will provide conclusive data on that subject in its next earnings release."Focusing on full year 2019 results, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 6% year-over-year with mixed performance among our major markets. International sales should increase by about 27% for the full year. However, our domestic sales will likely decrease by about 5% on a per annum basis, which we believe is consistent with industry-wide forecasts showing domestic markets receding by 6% to 12%. With these considerations in mind, we are revising our full year 2019 net sales forecast downward to ~$480 million [from $500 mln vs. $499 mln consensus]. Other previously forecasted financial metrics relating to 2019 remain unchanged since our last earnings call."16:29LW Lamb Weston forms joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina (75.50 -0.34)Lamb Weston has formed a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina to serve the nearly 2-billion-pound South American market.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon.

The earnings interview with management including Chief Executive Reed Hastings starts at 18:00 ET.Netflix has guided for third quarter EPS of $1.04 (vs. $0.89 last year) with an operating margin of 15.9% (+390 basis points yr/yr) and revenue up 31% to $5.25 bln. Estimates are in-line with guidance.Netflix also guided for 7 mln global paid net subscriber additions (6.2 mln international and 800,000 in a saturated US market) vs. a 6.07 mln increase in the third quarter of 2018, which would result in subs growing 22% yr/yr to 158.6 mln.Analysts expect the company to guide for a 9.5 mln increase in subs for the fourth quarter versus an 8.8 mln increase in the fourth quarter last year.The stock got crushed after Netflix missed second quarter subscriber guidance by a wide margin (2.7 mln vs. 5 mln) in July. Netflix said subscribers were soft in all regions, but more so in regions with price recent increases. The company noted that its content slate (releases) during the quarter led to the disappointing result, noting that third quarter subscriber additions are off to a strong start following the release of the third season of Stranger Things. Netflix also cited some pull-forward of demand following a strong first quarter result.Subs actually fell by 130,000 versus guidance for a 300,00 increase in the U.S. The U.S. market is saturated and accounts for most of the company's earnings, but will see a ton of competition hit the market over the next six months. Subs grew by 2.83 mln internationally versus 4.7 mln guidance.Netflix has historically missed second quarter sub projections due to seasonality and a weak content slate, only to bounce back in subsequent quarters.A strong third quarter and fourth quarter sub guidance will likely lead to a higher stock tomorrow, but it is unlikely to assuage concerns over competition.Netflix stock has continued to struggle since the weak second quarter amid concerns over competition. The streaming video on demand (SVOD) space will get really crowded with new offerings from from Disney+ (DIS), Apple TV+ (AAPL), HBO Max (T) and NBCU's Peacock (CMCSA) over the next six months.Netflix has a ~$124 bln market cap and trades at ~34x forward EBITDA estimates, ~60x EPS estimates and ~6x revenue. The sales multiple represents the low end of its historical range as investors question the competitive strength of the streaming leader. Netflix has become ubiquitous with its massive subscriber base over 155 mln that has essentially supplanted the traditional cable bundle for younger audiences, but consumers who can cancel their Netflix subscription at anytime will soon have tons of options for streaming shows and movies. The options market implies a ~10% move in the stock by Friday.14:02ECONX Beige Book points to slight to modest growth, down from modest growth in the September 4th report14:00ECONX Fed releases Beige BookThe U.S. economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report as business activity varied across the country. Reports from Districts representing states in the southern and western U.S. generally were more upbeat than Districts representing the Midwest and Great Plains. Household spending was solid on balance: nonauto retail sales increased modestly, while light vehicle sales were generally robust. Tourism and travel-related spending was up modestly. Housing market conditions changed little. On the business spending side, nonresidential construction increased at a slightly slower yet still modest pace, while leasing activity advanced at a slow but steady rate. Manufacturing activity continued to edge lower. Contacts in some Districts suggested that persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity. The early impact of a recent auto strike was limited. Freight shipments stabilized after falling during the previous reporting period. Bankers in many Districts reported moderately rising loan volumes, while activity in nonfinancial services increased solidly. Agricultural conditions deteriorated further due to the ongoing impacts of adverse weather, weak commodity prices, and trade disruptions. Business contacts mostly expect the economic expansion to continue; however, many lowered their outlooks for growth in the coming 6 to 12 months.Beige Book13:58OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:SIG Jan20 22.5 calls are seeing interest with 17960 contracts trading vs. open int of 0.

Last quarter, Alcoa reported at 16:10 ET, or 10 minutes after the close, so it should be around then.The street is looking for a Q3 loss of $(0.29) per share and revenue of $2.58 bln. Consensus for Adjusted EBITDA is approximately $369 mln for Q3 and for the full year consensus is at $1.68 bln. What's notable to us is that Alcoa has provided a full year Adjusted EBITDA outlook in the past. However, due to unprecedented market volatility, Alcoa has decided not to provide the guidance. While not providing specific Q3 guidance, Alcoa has said it expects benefits from higher volumes and lower costs for raw materials and maintenance in the Alumina and Bauxite segments. In the Aluminum segment, Alcoa expects improvements primarily from lower alumina costs. With the stock price having been cut in half over the past year, it's no secret that the aluminum market is struggling, driven by lower demand in both China and the world ex-China due to trade tensions and macro headwinds. The silver lining is that aluminum inventories continue to decline and are expected by year's end to reach levels not seen in more than a decade, since before the financial crisis in 2008. Nevertheless, Alcoa keeps lowering its aluminum demand outlook for 2019. It's now down to +1.25-2.25%, down from prior guidance of +2-3%, which had been lowered from +3-4%, predominantly due to lower demand growth in China and trade tensions generally. Alcoa has described a frustrating trend. Basically, there has been a consistent decline in global inventories over the last decade. However, aluminum prices have remained stubbornly unreactive thus far due to the volume of Chinese aluminum exports hitting the global market. On a final note, we mentioned the stock has been roughly cut in half over the past year as sluggish aluminum prices weigh on Alcoa. The good news is that the stock has somewhat stabilized since early June, which is hopefully an indication a lot of the negativity is already priced in. Investors will want to hear Alcoa's outlook for 2020 as hopefully there are early signs of improvement.13:38COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $9.50 (0.64%) at $1492.6/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.03 higher (0.17%) at $17.42/oz Dec copper settled $0.02 lower (0.77%) at $2.59/lb13:13SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: TEVA (29.02 mln +3.08%), ENDP (14.98 mln +22.64%), MNK (11.56 mln +6.25%), ACB (10.98 mln -1.73%)Materials: X (15.33 mln -4.99%), VALE (10.66 mln -1.62%)Industrials: GE (22.9 mln +0.9%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (28.16 mln -6.77%), ROKU (15.46 mln -0.01%), F (12.83 mln +0.66%)Information Technology: AMD (27.31 mln +1.14%), NOK (12.58 mln +1.6%), MSFT (11.07 mln -1.15%), AAPL (10.94 mln -0.7%)Financials: BAC (54.04 mln +2%), QQQ (11.19 mln -0.41%), WFC (10.22 mln -1.07%)Energy: CHK (33.16 mln -1.49%), MDR (10.65 mln +14.55%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: RYTM (6.14x +1.68%), ASMB (5.77x +29.19%), PRQR (5.76x +3.22%), RETA (2.72x +5.31%), ATNX (2.15x -8.61%), AUPH (1.89x +7.82%)Industrials: CUB (2.41x +7.22%), AJRD (1.93x +2.25%)Consumer Discretionary: SNBR (3.32x -1.56%), FCAU (2.28x +1.05%)Information Technology: TECD (3.83x +13.98%), WDAY (3.59x -12.55%), PAGS (2.58x -2.64%)Financials: ESGD (12.09x +0.08%), NHF (5.3x -1.97%), RBS (2.21x +1.55%), EIM (2.12x +0.23%)Consumer Staples: NBEV (2.49x +19.71%)Utilities: NGG (2.02x +0.45%)13:11SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ASMB (12.02 +29.19%), ENDP (4.28 +22.64%), INO (2.45 +9.15%), AUPH (5.04 +7.82%), UBX (7.32 +6.86%), IMMU (15.35 +6.67%), MNK (2.21 +6.25%)Materials: AG (9.76 +6.15%), SBGL (6.58 +5.96%)Industrials: CUB (74 +7.22%), GVA (35.05 +7.14%)Consumer Discretionary: TEN (12.94 +7.97%), TLRD (4.39 +5.88%)Information Technology: TECD (126.9 +13.98%), FIT (3.8 +10.14%)Energy: MDR (2.52 +14.55%), SPN (0.52 +14.26%), REI (1.61 +7.33%), NBR (1.86 +6.9%)Consumer Staples: NBEV (3.28 +19.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VRAY (2.55 -11.01%), NTRA (35.82 -8.67%), ATNX (10.14 -8.61%), APHA (5.03 -7.33%)Materials: RYAM (4.23 -10%), TMST (5.33 -7.63%)Consumer Discretionary: ASNA (0.47 -6.9%), NIO (1.45 -6.77%)Information Technology: WDAY (158.25 -12.55%), COUP (140.74 -9.02%), APPN (45.93 -8.74%), NOW (251.17 -8.41%), AVLR (68.26 -8.05%), MDB (124.15 -7.97%), PLAN (43.99 -7.95%), AYX (103.5 -7.78%), WK (41.72 -7.68%), SPLK (112.36 -6.25%), DQ (40.8 -6.23%)Consumer Staples: RAD (8.6 -6.68%)13:10PDCO Patterson Companies responds to Administrative Law Judge recommendation, does not anticipate that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations (17.40 +0.08)12:59TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to report overnight (50.76 +0.37)Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 50.76, +0.37, +0.7%) will report its Q3 results overnight, followed by management's conference call tomorrow at 2:00 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the contract chip manufacturer to report a 7.9% yr/yr increase in EPS to TWD3.71 on a 9.8% yr/yr increase in revenue to TWD285.80 bln. TSM has had a very good showing since the release of its Q2 results on July 18. The stock has surged 22% since then, having climbed nearly 15% over the past month. The semiconductor industry has not fully recovered from the sharp slowdown at the end of 2018, but TSM has been able to withstand that weakness due in part to its size as well as expectations for an imminent rebound in activity. Most recently, shares received a boost from reports of stronger than expected sales of the iPhone 11, which imply increased production of components. TSM reportedly expects that global shipments of 5G smartphones will reach 300 mln units in 2020. Last quarter, the company reported a slight decrease in inventory, which reached a record during Q1. Additional progress on inventory reduction would go a long way toward justifying the recent rally.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing trades at 20.9x forward earnings expectations.12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks trade mixed; investors weigh macro, earnings newsThe stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.12:42EXC Exelon underperforming after sudden retirement of CEO of Exelon Utilities unit amid federal into lobbying activities (45.87 -1.19)Last night, the company announced that it has appointed Calvin G. Butler Jr., CEO of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company ("BGE"), as Interim CEO of Exelon Utilities, effective immediately. This appointment follows the retirement of Anne Pramaggiore, Senior Executive Vice President and CEO of Exelon Utilities, which is also effective immediately. Mr. Butler will continue to serve as CEO of BGE. The CEOs of Exelon's other utilities -- Joseph Dominguez, CEO of ComEd, Michael A. Innocenzo, CEO of PECO, and David M. Velazquez, CEO of Pepco Holdings -- will report to Mr. Butler. In addition, Exelon Utility CEO staff heads Val Jensen, Carim Khouzami and Mike Kormos will also report to Mr. Butler moving forward. Earlier this month, the company disclosed that it received a second grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois that requires production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities, including Illinois State Senator Martin Sandoval:As previously disclosed, Exelon Corporation and Commonwealth Edison Company (the "Companies") received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, which required production of information concerning lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. On October 4, 2019, the Companies received a second grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois that requires production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities, including Illinois State Senator Martin Sandoval. "The Companies have cooperated fully with the U.S. Attorney and intend to continue to cooperate fully and expeditiously with any government requests or inquiries. On June 21, 2019, the Exelon Corporation Board formed a Special Oversight Committee, consisting solely of independent directors, to oversee the Companies' cooperation and compliance with the subpoena, any further action taken by the U.S. Attorney and any resulting actions that may be required or recommended. The Special Oversight Committee has engaged independent outside counsel to advise and assist the Committee."According to The Chicago Tribune, Pramaggiore is reportedly a focus of the ongoing federal probe.Following the developments, Mizuho (Neutral rated) lowered their price target from $49 to $47 and cautioned that "[p]otential grand jury indictments of Exelon lobbyists in the Madigan/Sandoval investigations could derail attempts by the company to obtain passage of legislation in Illinois next year."12:07COMM Commscope: German Federal Patent Court has issued decisions upholding the validity of important CommScope patents that had been challenged by a competitor, COMLAB (11.51 +0.18)At an October 9 oral hearing, the German Federal Patent Court rejected challenges by COMLAB regarding the validity of the German part of European Patent EP1022849B1 (Action No. 5 Ni 6/17 (EP)) owned by CommScope's affiliate Andrew Wireless Systems. The Federal Patent Court already upheld the German part of European Patent EP2180605B1 in a decision dated March 27, 2019 (Action No. 6 Ni 23/17 (EP)). COMLAB filed appeal against the Federal Patent Court's decision that is now pending before the Federal Supreme Court (X ZR 84/19) and can appeal the most recent decision.12:03IBM IBM Q3 Earnings Preview; All eyes on Red Hat follow through (141.78 -1.22)Information technology giant IBM is slated to release Q3 results tonight after the bell with a conference call scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. ET.The Capital IQ Consensus Estimate for IBM's Q3 EPS stands at $2.66 (vs $3.42 a year ago) on revenue declines of 2.5% to $18.29 bln.This quarter may be a tricky one to judge based on the incoming accounting of the Red Hat deal (closed last quarter).At the company's August 2 Red Hat update event, management outlined guidance for 2020-2021:Revenue growth of MSD at constant currency; Operating pre-tax income growth of HSD; FCF >100% realization; a leverage ratio consistent with mid-to-high single A range.Management also updated 2019 operating EPS guidance for at least $12.80 (vs. at least $13.90 as standalone).What's more, the company sees the Red Hat deal as accretive to operating EPS by the end of year two.One of the questions investors are hankering to get an answer to is: has management righted the ship? Recall that last quarter IBM's largest segment by sales, Global Technology Services, reported a 6.7% decline to $6.8 bln. Obviously, the segment is a focal point purely based on size alone, but the troubles weren't just last quarter. In Q1 the GTS segment saw revenue declines of 7%.IBM steps into the Q3 report with a $126 bln market capitalization and trades at about 11.5x forward earnings estimates.12:03SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Achillion Pharma (ACHN) rises on all-cash acquisition deal -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersACHN (6.25 +71.23%): To be acquired by Alexion (ALXN) for an all-cash initial consideration of approx. $930 mln, or $6.30/share; potential additional contingent considerations, which hinge on clinical and regulatory developments such as FDA approval of danicopan and ACH-5228 Phase 3 initiation, could elevate the amount payable to co's shareholders to $8.30/share. Alexion looks forward to applying its "development expertise" to co's oral Factor D inhibitors in an endeavor to unlock the approach's potential and deliver benefits to patients. The stock moves to its highest levels in almost three years. ENDP (4.22 +20.91%): Touched up to three-month highs on higher than average volume; drug manufacturers generally outperform today in concert with reports that various sector names (JNJ, ABC, MCK, CAH, TEVA...) have made proposals regarding or are in talks concerning settlement of opioid litigation. AUPH (5.13 +9.85%): Continued strength; co today reported that the last patient study visit has occurred in the AURORA Phase 3 lupus nephritis study of voclosporin; efficacy and safety results from the study remain on-track to be reported by the end of the fourth quarter, and co anticipates that disclosure of the results will be "followed by the necessary preparations to submit an NDA for voclosporin during the first half of 2020." The AURORA II continuation study is also reportedly progressing as planned.Small Cap LosersAPHA (4.99 -8.1%): After moving higher by circa 25% yesterday following its Q1 earnings report. The cannabis sector generally cools off. ATNX (10.17 -8.3%): Drops to new five-month lows on higher than average volume. The stock has now moved lower by circa 16% month-to-date and trades lower by more than 50% from its July highs. NIO (1.46 -5.81%): Declines on moderately high volume; items of interest for co and the EV space this week have included Chinese new energy vehicle sales results for September and rumors from a reporting source in China that co was in talks regarding a factory investment.12:02PS Pluralsight (+2.7%) bucking weakness among software stocks after hiring former Salesforce (CRM) CIO, and then EVP of N.A. sales Ross Meyercord as Chief Revenue Officer (16.97 +0.46)The stock is down more than 40% since missing billings estimates and guiding down third quarter revenue, citing sales execution issues.11:44CSX CSX to report this evening (68.90 -0.27)Rail carriers CSX (CSX 68.90, -0.27, -0.4%) and Union-Pacific (UNP 163.73, +0.59, +0.4%) will report their Q3 results between today's closing bell and tomorrow's open. CSX will report this evening, followed by management's conference call at 16:30 ET, while Union-Pacific's report will be released tomorrow morning, followed by a conference call at 8:45 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects CSX to report a 2.9% yr/yr decrease in EPS to $1.02 on a 4.7% yr/yr decrease in revenue to $2.98 bln. The Capital IQ consensus expects Union-Pacific to report a 7.4% yr/yr increase in EPS to $2.31 on a 4.7% yr/yr decrease in revenue to $5.65 bln. Both rail carriers are among the 20 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Another DJTA component, J.B. Hunt Transportation Services (JBHT 114.99, +3.39, +3.0%) reported weaker than expected Q3 EPS yesterday, coupled with slightly better than expected revenue. CSX trades about 15% below its record high from May while UNP is about 10% below its own record from August. Like JBHT, CSX and UNP are likely to lament the current operating environment, considering weekly Rail Traffic reports from the Association of American Railroads have consistently pointed to yr/yr declines in traffic between 5% and 10%. September saw yr/yr carload decreases in 14 out of 20 commodity categories after 12 out of 20 commodity categories showed yr/yr declines in August. CSX was downgraded to Neutral at JPMorgan on October 4 while UNP was upgraded to Overweight at Atlantic Equities. UNP CFO reaffirmed the company's guidance for FY19 operating ratio below 61% on September 4. The CFO did note that the company now expects volume in the second half of 2019 to decline in the mid-single digits while previous guidance called for a decrease of about 2%.CSX trades at 15.8x forward earnings expectations while UNP trades at 16.9x forward estimates.11:38SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACHN, ACM, ARNC, ASC, ATKR, BHE, BLD, BLDR, BMCH, BZH, CASH, CBPO, CCS, CELG, CHTR, CNS, DE, DEA, DLTR, DOCU, IBP, INFO, INXN, IRT, JBL, KBH, KN, KOD, KSU, LBRDK, LEN, LGIH, MAS, MDC, MTH, MTZ, NFBK, ODFL, PHM, RETA, SHW, SNX, TECD, TMCX, TMHC, TPH, VICI, WD, WMSStocks that traded to 52 week lows: DERM, DT, FLDM, GTYH, HEP, ICUI, LBRT, LNDC, PRQR, RVLV, SSTI, TACO, TEUM, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: DCOM, PDFSThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: BSTC, FULC, NGVC, NPK, RMNIETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWT, ITB, PALL, PSK, XHB11:35Events and Conferences TomorrowImage Sensors Auto Americas 2019 (Oct 17-18)Scheduled to appear: INFO, XLNX, LYFT, SNEPMA Fresh Summit Conference & Expo 2019 (Oct 17-19)Scheduled to appear: AGFSAmong company updates: Sanderson Farms (SAFM) investor day at 20:30 ET11:30DT Dynatrace (-4%): Recent IPO falls to record low as software stocks come under pressure following tepid Workday (WDAY -12%) Analyst Day (17.41 -0.79)11:28XLF Money Center Comparables- Morgan Stanley reports tomorrow before the market opensMorgan Stanley will report earnings tomorrow before the open with a conference call to follow at 8am ET.Current Capital IQ consensus stands at EPS of $1.12 (-4% yr/yr), Net Income at $1.80 bln (-10% yr/yr), on Revenues of $9.63 bln (-2% yr/yr).MS results will be compared to peers.

The two seem to be canceling each other out to a large extent, which is keeping the major indices in check.The outsized moves have been reserved for individual stocks with news, like Bank of America (BAC 30.45, +0.72, +2.4%) and United Airlines (UAL 90.08, +2.20, +2.5%), both of which reported better than expected earnings results. Accordingly, there hasn't been a lot of movement at the sector level.Seven sectors are up and four are down, with changes ranging from a 0.6% decline (information technology) to a 1.0% increase (materials).In terms of the macro hangups, they include the weaker-than-expected retail sales numbers for September, reports that a Brexit deal compromise between the EU and UK might not come to fruition before the Oct. 31 deadline, and misgivings about the completion of the "phase one" trade deal with China.The latter has stemmed from news that the U.S. House passed measures that support the Hong Kong protesters, which prompted a warning from China that it will respond with countermeasures if the U.S. Senate also passes those measures and the legislation ultimately becomes law.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are flat; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%.10:03VRRM Verra Mobility to acquire Pagatelia; terms not disclosed (13.99 -0.03)Pagatelia is a European leader in electronic tolling throughout Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.09:07TWOU 2U appoints Paul S.

In Study 202 (Rx nave patients), greater mean log10 declines in HBV DNA (5.27 vs 3.99; p=0.017) and RNA (2.34 vs 0.61; p<0.001) were achieved with 731+Nrtl (entecavir) versus entecavir alone. In Study 201 (Nrtl-suppressed patients), the proportion of patients on 731+Nrtl versus Nrtl alone achieving DNA target not detected (TND) was 69% vs 0% (p<0.001), and the proportion of patients achieving RNA <35 U/mL whose RNA was less than 35 U/mL at baseline was 52% vs 0% (p=0.0013) respectively. In Study 211, there are 64 HBeAg+ patients currently on extended treatment beyond 24 weeks. Among the 27 HBeAg+ patients receiving 731+Nrtl in Study 201, 41% (11/27) have now achieved DNA TND along with RNA <35 U/mL and HBeAg <1 IU/mL. At their last timepoint, Study 202 patients now in Study 211 (n=22) have demonstrated mean DNA and RNA declines of 6.1 and 3.0 logs, respectively, with observed mean log changes of more than or equal to 0.6 for HBeAg (11 patients more than or equal to 0.5, 4 patients more than or equal to 1.0), >0.8 log for HBcrAg (7 patients more than or equal to 1.0, 3 patients more than or equal to 2.0) and more than or equal to 0.4 log for HBsAg (7 patients more than or equal to 0.5, 3 patients more than or equal to 1.0). 731 continues to exhibit a favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients treated for up to 1 year, with only mild/moderate adverse events and lab abnormalities, and only a single discontinuation due to a Grade 1 rash. The combination of 731+NrtI results in faster and deeper declines in HBV DNA and RNA than NrtI alone, as well as subsequent declines in the surrogate markers of cccDNA (pgRNA, HBeAg and HBcrAg) predictive of cccDNA pool depletion, and HBsAg. The emergent data supports the continued development of 731. ABI-H2158 -- The Second-Generation Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Core Inhibitor (CI) ABI-H2158 is Associated with Potent Antiviral Activity in a 14-Day Monotherapy Study in HBeAg-positive Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)Abstract Summary: The Phase 1b study is enrolling sequential cohorts of 9 patients and each cohort will be randomized to receive 2158 or placebo (7:2) QD for 14 days in a blinded manner. Dosing in the 1st cohort (100 mg) has been completed. In patients receiving 2158, mean declines from Baseline to Day 15 in HBV DNA and RNA levels were 2.3 log10 IU/mL [range 1.7 -- 3.0] and 2.1 log10 IU/mL [range 1.5 - 2.7] respectively. No serious AEs, dose limiting toxicities or premature discontinuations were reported. Three patients reported a total of 5 mild, drug-related AEs that recovered without intervention; dizziness, fatigue, rash, headache and upper abdominal pain. Treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities were infrequent, mild and transient, with no ALT elevations Grade more than or equal to 1 in severity. Day 14 plasma 2158 Cmax and AUC0-24hr were 3,390 ng/mL and 46,100 hr*ng/mL, respectively. Results from the initial 100 mg low dose of ABI-H2158 cohort demonstrated potent antiviral activity, a favorable safety profile when administered for 14 days, and support once daily dosing in CHB patients.07:43PAG Penske Auto increases quarterly dividend to $0.41/share from $0.40/share (45.08 )07:38ABT Abbott Labs reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q4 EPS in-line (81.98 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.84 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.84; revenues rose 5.5% year/year to $8.08 bln vs the $8.1 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus, and 7.6 percent on an organic basis including 3.8% in nutrition, 6.6% in diagnostics, 7.9% in established pharma and 10.6% in medical devices.

Chinese markets dipped lower after unsettling reports that the "phase one" deal that was "agreed" upon over the weekend may unravel.In Europe, the major bourses are echoing the broader sentiment with a mixed tone.

Kitchen Collection has ~800 employees. "While operating losses have moderated from the prior year in the first half of 2019, Kitchen Collection continues to experience decreased comparable store sales as a result of declining foot traffic due to the consumer shift to e-commerce sales. Despite our best efforts to return Kitchen Collection to profitability through footprint consolidation, further deterioration in foot traffic has lowered our outlook for the prospects of a future return to profitability and positive cash flow generation. We have evaluated strategic alternatives to maximize the value of the Kitchen Collection business and reached the difficult but necessary decision that it is in the best interests of the company and all of its stakeholders to wind down the business by the end of 2019."During the third quarter, Kitchen Collection expects to record a non-cash, pretax impairment charge of $1 mln related to property, plant and equipment and a valuation allowance of $1.9 mln related to deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating losses.

This change in top line performance, coupled with lower factory absorption, higher operating expenses arising largely from acquisitions, and other factors, will adversely affect net income for the period. Thus, management expects that quarterly earnings per share are likely to be less than half of the [$0.23] consensus estimate and will provide conclusive data on that subject in its next earnings release."Focusing on full year 2019 results, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 6% year-over-year with mixed performance among our major markets. International sales should increase by about 27% for the full year. However, our domestic sales will likely decrease by about 5% on a per annum basis, which we believe is consistent with industry-wide forecasts showing domestic markets receding by 6% to 12%. With these considerations in mind, we are revising our full year 2019 net sales forecast downward to ~$480 million [from $500 mln vs. $499 mln consensus]. Other previously forecasted financial metrics relating to 2019 remain unchanged since our last earnings call."16:29LW Lamb Weston forms joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina (75.50 -0.34)Lamb Weston has formed a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina to serve the nearly 2-billion-pound South American market.

HONG KONG-BORN AUSTRALIAN LAWMAKER FACES PROBE INTO LINKS TO CHINESE COMMUNIST-BACKED GROUPSStates News ServiceSeptember 16, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 371 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SYDNEY BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By Phil MercerThe first Chinese-born woman to sit in the lower house of Australia's federal parliament is under a sustained attack for failing to disclose her membership in organizations linked to China's Communist Party.There are claims Gladys Liu had connections with senior figures in Beijing's covert political propaganda apparatus, which have raised questions about her eligibility to sit in the Australian parliament.The lawmaker has admitted being a member of the China Overseas Exchange Association between 2003 and 2015, which at the time was part of China's powerful State Council, the Chinese government's central political and administrative body. The Hong Kong-born politician says her membership was entirely innocent, and has denied any conflict of interest. She said she is "a proud Australian."FILE - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaks during his visit to the Hanoi Formula One Grand Prix construction site in Vietnam, Aug. 23, 2019.Australia's center-right Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Liu is the victim of a "smear" campaign with a "grubby undertone".The political assault is led by the opposition Labor Party. It has demanded to know if the government had received warnings about her from Australia's intelligence agencies. Ministers have declined to comment.Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese denies the scrutiny of Liu is based on race and says he wants to get to the truth."What the motivation is here is to ensure that there is accountability for people's actions. It has nothing to do with race and the only person who has raised race in these issues are, of course, prime minister Morrison," he said.Gladys Liu is a former speech pathologist who became an Australian citizen in 1992. Her parliamentary career has collided with growing anxiety in Australia over allegations of Chinese meddling in its domestic politics, and cyber espionage. A taskforce is to investigate foreign interference in Australian universities because of fears over China's growing influence on campuses.These are sensitive issues, given Australia's reliance on China for its recent prosperity. China is Australia's biggest trading partner.Load-Date: September 19, 2019End of Document

Watch The Episode That Got 'South Park' Banned In ChinaStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 8, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: CULTURE; Pg. 1Length: 425 wordsByline: Julia GonzalesBodyAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the very IRL Chinese censors South Park put in its crosshairs are now deleting virtually ever clip and episode of the show in China, as well as even online discussion aboutSouth Park. THR reviewed the Chinese social network Weibo and found zero mention of the series; clips and episodes on Chinese streamer Youku didn't work; and "South Park" discussion forums on Tieba had been closed.Without giving away the full plot of the episode, it takes a lot of shots at China and - sure enough - the Chinese government has responded.Later Monday, Parker and Stone issued an "official apology" to China, although not without a fair bit of sarcasm. Ironically enough, that has led to the country's censors to seemingly banSouth Park.The post, marked as an "apology", read "Like the National Basketball Association, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts". Long live the great Communist Party of China.Long-running animated comedySouth Park has managed to generate a new global controversy, with the series now completely banned in China in the wake of its most recent episode.Groom Sexually Assaulted Bridesmaid, Cops Say.

He also admitted to investigators that he assaulted the victim, according to WNEP .A representative forSouth Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker did not immediately return Rolling Stone's request for comment.The "Band in China" episode has gotten a lot of social media attention for its critique of Hollywood players who bend over backwards not to offend Chinese censors.Meanwhile, Stan, Kenny, Butters and Jimmy form a death metal band at home inSouth Park. At the camp, Randy happens to run into fellow prisoner Winnie the Pooh, a not-so-subtle jab at Chinese censors' ongoing ban on imagery of the gentle, honey-loving stuffed animal after online mocking of presidentXi Jinping's slightly rounded bear-shaped physique using the iconic character became a viral sensation several years ago.In one scene, figures that resemble Disney-owned movie characters - including Thor and Black Panther from the Avengers films, a Star Wars Stormtrooper, and Snow White - get on a flight to China as other passengers are talking about their companies wanting to get Chinese citizens as customers.The NBA has been under fire from Beijing after the general manager of the Houston Rockets posted an image supportive of the Hong Kong protests.Load-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

China-U.S. tension dribbles into to the sports worldThe Spinnaker: University of North FloridaOctober 25, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS; Pg. 1Length: 454 wordsByline: Zach Yearwood, Sports ReporterBodyAt what point does money impede freedom of speech in America? The question has come to the forefront of attention this month in the realm of sports.With the NBA season officially underway, it is easy to forget about the NBA's current dilemma. Just weeks before the season began, one NBA story made headlines internationally.The controversy began October 4, when Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, tweeted a photo supporting Hong Kong in its struggle for independence from China. The people of Hong Kong have been pushing for sovereignty for years. Protests flared up in June when a bill was proposed to extradite fugitives to mainland China.In response to Morey's tweet, China blocked all subsequent NBA preseason games being played in China from airing on television. All wholly owned Chinese companies halted business with the league and the Chinese government even called for the firing of Morey. The NBA and the Rockets refused.The Houston Rockets alone held several sponsorships with China. The team arguably had the closest relationship with China of all NBA teams, considering they had the most prominent Chinese player of all time, Yao Ming. Ming is a hall of fame center who played with the Rockets for eight seasons. He is currently the chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association.The issue sparked debate over whether the NBA should concede to the demands of an authoritarian government in the interest of preserving their own bottom line.The NBA is not the only organization embroiled in controversy with China over Hong Kong.Video game company Activision Blizzard suspended professional Hearthstone player Ng Wai 'Blitzchung' Chung for a year and withheld prize money he had previously won. The Hong Kong native was punished by Blizzard for an interview he was a part of after winning a tournament.In the interview, Chung shouted "liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age." Blizzard, after receiving backlash from China, suspended Chung for a year and withheld his winnings from the tournament.The company was not prepared, however, for the criticism that came from the public, who immediately got behind Chung and Hong Kong. In response, Blizzard reinstated his winnings and reduced the suspension to six months.China, a country whose government tends to suppress dissent, has tried to censor free speech in America's entertainment industry. This has intensified the economic and political rivalry between the two countries. The relationship between the United States and China has already been strained over the past few months due to the ongoing trade war.__For more information or news tips, or if you see an error in this story or have any compliments or concerns, contact [email protected].Load-Date: October 26, 2019End of Document

"A Chinese government spokesman urged the US to stay out of the country's internal politics and to remove the entities from the Entity List.Late in the trading session, the US announced it would initiate visa restrictions on Chinese officials over the treatment of Muslim minorities. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the move is aimed at officials "who are believed to be responsible for, complicit in, the detention and abuse of Uighurs, Kazakhs, or other members of Muslim minority groups."Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported the US is discussing restricting capital flows into China, focusing on investments by US government pension funds.All 11 sectors that comprise the Standard & Poor's 500 ended lower, with eight falling more than 1%.

China criticizes Apple for app that tracks Hong Kong policeAssociated Press State & LocalOctober 9, 2019 Wednesday 11:06 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 503 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Apple became the latest company targeted for Chinese pressure over protests in Hong Kong when the ruling Communist Party's main newspaper criticized the tech giant Wednesday for a smartphone app that allows activists to report police movements.HKmap.live, designed by an outside supplier and available on Apple Inc.'s online store, "facilitates illegal behavior," People's Daily said in a commentary."Is Apple guiding Hong Kong thugs?" the newspaper said.Beijing has pressed companies including Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways to take the government's side against the protests, which are in their fourth month.Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.HKmap.live allows users to report police locations, use of tear gas and other details that are added to a regularly updated map. Another version is available for smartphones that use the Android operating system.Asked whether the Chinese government had asked Apple to remove HKmap.live from its online store, a foreign ministry spokesman said he had no information about that."What I can tell you is that these radical, violent crimes in Hong Kong have seriously challenged the legal system and social order in Hong Kong, threatened the safety of Hong Kong residents' lives and property, and undermined the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong," said the spokesman, Geng Shuang."Anyone who has a conscience and justice should resist and oppose instead of supporting and indulging those actions," Geng said at a regular news briefing.The demonstrations began over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include other grievances and demands for greater democracy.Criticism of Apple followed government attacks starting last weekend on the National Basketball Association over a comment by the general manager of the Houston Rockets in support of the protesters. China's state TV has canceled broadcasts of NBA games."Apple jumped into this on its own and mixed together business with politics and commercial activity with illegal activities," People's Daily said.The newspaper warned Apple might be damaging its reputation with Chinese consumers.Brands targeted in the past by Beijing have been subjected to campaigns by the entirely state-controlled press to drive away consumers or disruptive investigations by tax and other regulators.China has long been critical to Apple's business.The mainland is Apple's second-biggest market after the United States but CEO Tim Cook has said since 2013 it will eventually become No. 1. Sales in China declined 4% in the quarter ending in June, but that was an improvement over the 25% contraction in the first half of its fiscal year."This recklessness will cause much trouble for Apple," People's Daily said. "Apple needs to think deeply."Apple also is an important asset to China.Most of its iPhones and tablet computers are assembled in Chinese factories that employ hundreds of thousands of people. Chinese vendors supply components for Mac Pro computers that are assembled in Texas.Load-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

US blacklists 28 Chinese organizations and companies over Xinjiang campsCNN WireOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 2:07 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 772 wordsByline: By James Griffiths, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Washington is adding 28 Chinese companies, government offices and security bureaus to a United States blacklist over their alleged role in facilitating human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region. Monday's announcement targets some of China's top artificial intelligence companies in a similar way to the US move against smartphone giant Huawei earlier this year, and comes just days before crucial trade talks between the two sides. In a statement, the US Commerce Department said "these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in [Xinjiang]."For the last two-and-a-half years, China has been detaining hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in what Beijing alternately describes as "voluntary de-radicalization camps" and "vocational training centers." Former detainees have described them as closer to internment camps, however, and allegations of abuse are rampant, including in firsthand accounts given to CNN describing torture and forced political re-education under the threat of violence.Chinese officials have long defended the crackdown in Xinjiang as necessary to tackle extremism and in line with Chinese law and international practice. In a statement Tuesday, Beijing said the US accusations were "groundless and senseless" and the sanctions on its organizations and companies "seriously violated the basic rules of international relations.""We urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes, withdraw relevant decisions and stop interfering with China's internal affairs," said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, at a press briefing. "China will continue to take resolute measures to firmly safeguard its national sovereignty and developmental interests."Asked about potential retaliation against American companies, the spokesman said, "Please keep watching."The organizations targeted by the United States are now barred from buying US products or importing American technology. The list includes 20 government and security bureaus in Xinjiang, and eight companies, including Hikvision, one of the world's largest manufacturers of AI-driven video surveillance products, and Meiya Pico, a leading digital forensics firm. "The US Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China," Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement. "This action will ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenseless minority populations."Shares in Hikvision --- which has previously been accused by US lawmakers of helping China create a "high-tech police state" --- were suspended in Shenzhen following the move.Hikvision said the company strongly opposed the US decision, adding it had been working with Trump administration officials over the last 12 months "to clarify misunderstandings about the company and address their concerns.""Hikvision, as the security industry's global leader, respects human rights and takes our responsibility to protect people in the US and the world seriously," a company spokesperson said.Meiya Pico has yet to publicly comment. The blacklisting of Chinese organizations comes just before high-level trade talks are due to resume in Washington on Thursday in the hopes of finding a way to end the damaging US-China trade war. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump said "my inclination is to get a big deal. We've come this far. We're doing well." "Can something happen? I guess, maybe. Who knows? But I think it's probably unlikely. Okay?" Trump added. The American leader is facing intense scrutiny over his apparent request to Chinese authorities to look into his potential Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden, over the former vice president and his son's business dealings in China. During a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping about Biden, Trump promised to remain quiet on ongoing anti-government unrest in Hong Kong if trade talks progressed, according to two people familiar with the discussion. He denied promising to stay quiet Monday, "but I (did) say that we are negotiating. If anything happened bad, I think that would be a very bad for the negotiation." Yong Xiong contributed reporting. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

New DRONERESPONDERS Report Examines Foreign Dominance of U.S. Public Safety Drone Sector; Research explores landscape and perspectives surrounding use of Chinese sUAS by America's First RespondersBusiness WireSeptember 24, 2019 Tuesday 4:15 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 689 wordsDateline: MIAMI BodyAs a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers seeks to ban Chinese drone purchases by federal agencies, new research from DRONERESPONDERS - the world's leading non-profit organization supporting public safety UAS - examines the perspectives of America's first responders operating foreign-made, small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS).The DRONERESPONDERS report, Chinese sUAS Technology in the U.S. Public Safety Sector, was released today - less than one-week after a proposed bill titled the American Security Drone Act of 2019 was filed at the U.S. Capitol. The DRONERESPONDERS report includes results and analysis from online survey data collected over the past several weeks from public safety drone program leaders and operators."Our goal for this report was to better understand the perspectives of America's first responders who are using drones made in China," says Christopher Todd, Executive Director of the 501(c)3 non-profit Airborne International Response Team (AIRT) and a lead analyst on the report. "We were able to glean some incredible information surrounding the role of foreign UAS technology for public safety."Todd says the timing of the DRONERESPONDERS report coinciding closely with the proposed bill from lawmakers was purely coincidental, yet underscores how interest surrounding the use of Chinese drones in America's airspace is increasing daily. Something echoed by another report analyst, DRONERESPONDERS Director, Chief Charles Werner (ret.)."We're seeing all types of public safety agencies from the Department of the Interior to small town fire department using these systems," says Werner. "We wanted to explore how recent rumors surrounding drone data security were affecting the mindset of these operators."The rumors Werner refers to primarily involve Chinese drone maker DJI, the leading global manufacturer and seller of sUAS. DJI has been a recent target of U.S. officials who claim the company is positioned as a potential relay that, if pressed, could send sensitive drone data from U.S. customers to the Chinese government - something DJI vehemently denies."We have no dog in that fight, and no way to know what is really happening with the data," says Werner. "Our focus is on how all of this speculation is potentially impacting public safety agencies and operators using drone technology."Among the key findings from the Chinese sUAS Technology in the U.S. Public Safety Sector report:• Chinese firm DJI is the undisputed leader in providing drones to U.S. public safety agencies.• Confusion exists among local public safety professionals surrounding the alleged security vulnerabilities with Chinese drone technology.• Brand loyalty to DJI is precarious as the public safety sector waits for a viable U.S.-branded solution to enter the marketplace.Todd says that the new report was based upon the initial set of survey data to be released. He says DRONERESPONDERS has collected a wealth of data that will be used to create additional guidance to help public safety agencies better use drones for good."We'll be releasing additional information in the near future," said Todd. "We realize that the public safety sector needs more guidance to help make better decisions, and we're working hard to make that happen as quickly and accurately as possible."To download a complimentary copy of the DRONERESPONDERS Chinese sUAS Technology in the U.S. Public Safety Sector report, visit: http://research.droneresponders.org .About DRONERESPONDERS Public Safety AllianceDRONERESPONDERS is the world's fastest growing non-profit program supporting public safety UAS.

Apple's Tim Cook is now top adviser to the business school at 'China's Harvard'CNN WireOctober 23, 2019 Wednesday 3:00 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 672 wordsByline: By Laura He, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China and the United States are locked in a struggle for tech supremacy but you wouldn't know it from the list of luminaries on the advisory board of Tsinghua University's business school. Mark Zuckerberg, Satya Nadella and Elon Musk are all there. And now they have a new chairman --- Apple CEO Tim Cook.The university, known as "China's Harvard," has a storied history as a cradle of Chinese political and economic thought. It's one of the most elite education institutions in the country, and was even attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping.The School of Economics and Management said Cook chaired the board's annual meeting last Friday. His appointment was praised by board founder and former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, who said in a letter published Tuesday that he hopes the board "will become better and better" under Cook. Apple declined to comment on the news. The university's relationship with western leaders is strong, and the business school has included an A-list of executives --- particularly from the United States --- on its board since its establishment in 2000. Facebook's Zuckerberg, Tesla's Musk and Microsoft's Nadella were all listed as board members during the most recent school year. So were leaders from Walmart, IBM and General Motors. Its previous chairman was Jim Breyer, the American venture capitalist. Former Goldman Sachs CEO and US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and former Walmart CEO Lee Scott have also held that post.China is well represented, too. The country's top trade negotiator and vice premiere Liu He was listed as a board member during the most recent year, as were tech billionaires Jack Ma, Pony Ma and Robin Li. An annual board meeting was even the setting for Cook's first meeting with Jack Ma, the former Alibaba chairman and one of the most prominent Chinese businessmen, according to the school.Zhu described the board as an "an important bridge of communication between China and the world" in his letter. But China's relationship with some parts of the world --- and especially the United States --- has grown tense in recent years. And though Cook has served on the Tsinghua board since 2013, his elevation to chairman comes at a particularly sensitive time. The US-China trade war, the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and other global headwinds have complicated the relationship between the world's economic superpowers. And American companies doing business in China are under an enormous amount of pressure to navigate those relationships in a delicate way without putting their operations at risk. Now that US-China relations have soured, maintaining the "bridge" that Zhu described "has become all the more important," said Ronald Wan, chief executive of Partners Capital International in Hong Kong. "There are still a lot of misunderstandings between the world's two largest economies," he added. "I think that's the significance of this brain trust."Apple --- which recorded $9.1 billion in sales last quarter from Greater China, or 17% of its global total --- was recently scrutinized after it pulled a real-time mapping app used by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, from its App Store. Cook has worked to bolster his company's relationship with China. Just last week he met with China's top market regulator to talk about Apple's investment and business development in China, along with "consumer rights protection and fulfilling corporate social responsibility," according to the Chinese government. And in March, Cook told attendees at a conference in Beijing that his company was "grateful" that China has opened its doors to Apple."We encourage China to continue to open up," Cook said at the China Development Forum. "We see that as essential, not only for China to reach its full potential, but for the global economy to thrive. ... Our future, therefore, depends on collaboration."CNN Business' Sherisse Pham contributed to this report.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

San Francisco tour guide charged with carrying USA secrets to ChinaStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 1, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 506 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBody"The charges announced today provide a rare glimpse into the secret efforts of the People's Republic of China to obtain classified national security information from the United States", Anderson added in his statement.Last October, prosecutors charged a Chinese spy with attempting to steal trade secrets from several American aviation and aerospace companies, the first time an MSS operative was extradited to the United States.He was arrested on Friday at his $1.2 million home in California and appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero in San Francisco, who ordered Peng be held without bond pending further proceedings.Trained in traditional Chinese medicine, Peng is believed to have been working as a sightseeing tour operator in the San Francisco area for Chinese students and visitors.But that wasn't his only job, prosecutors said: Xuehua Peng, a naturalized USA citizen who is also known as Edward, has been arrested and charged with spying for the Chinese government in his adopted country.As the Associated Press reports, Peng's m.o. was to rent hotel rooms to use as "dead drops" where he would leave $20,000 and then have an exchange with an Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who was supposedly working as a double agent for China.Call of Duty: Mobile blasts its way onto Android and iOS devicesJudging by the Play Store description for the app, it's possible that the developers have scheduled its rollout for a later date. To access the Battle Royale mode, you must play around 30 minutes of Multiplayer matches, but that's very easy to achieve.He is scheduled to return to court on Wednesday.Anderson states Peng is charged with using secret places to deliver advice, providing payments, and personally carrying to Beijing secure digital cards containing classified data related to USA national security. In July, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before a Senate panel that the FBI had more than 1,000 investigations involving economic espionage and attempted intellectual property theft - almost all of which lead back to China.He then flew to Beijing where, according to investigators, he contacted MSS agents and handed over the card. He then traveled to Beijing to pass the cards to his handlers at the Ministry of State Security , the main Chinese spy agency.The US Justice Department has announced that an American tour guide has been charged with spying for China's intelligence services.The source would gain entry to a hotel room, sometimes telling the front-desk clerk that "his friend "Ed" had reserved a room for him", according to the complaint. He will be prosecuted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. More than 80 percent of all economic spying charges since 2012 have involved China. The office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Peng faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of US$250,000 for acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government - a charge often used by the Justice Department for espionage cases.Load-Date: October 30, 2019End of Document

Zara the Latest Brand Attacked as China's Tactics Turn to 'White Terror'RealMoneySeptember 3, 2019 Tuesday 11:00 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1219 wordsByline: Alex Frew McMillanHighlight: Beijing is attacking foreign brands over any implicit signs they might support Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrations while spreading anti-demonstrator propaganda on U.S. social media.BodyThe fast-fashion brand Zara is the latest company caught in the crossfire surrounding the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. It is scrambling to defend itself against accusations of supporting the Hong Kong demonstrators by keeping four stores closed on a demonstration day.Zara has 12 stores in Hong Kong. Four in the heart of the city were closed for business on Monday morning, although the stores in suburban locations continued business as usual. The pro-democracy protestors called a two-day strike on Monday and Tuesday, the first two days of the academic year for government schools, with many students attending demonstrations instead of class.The attempt to discredit Zara fits the tactics of "white terror" -- indirect or anonymous attacks designed to create a climate of fear over the demonstrations -- that China has now deployed in an attempt to quell the dissent in Hong Kong. The state-run Global Times newspaper, used by Beijing to promote its viewpoint overseas, said Zara is "suspected of catering to" the strikes and has "set a very negative example.""Objectively, it (Zara) has formed some kind of response expected by the extremist forces," the newspaper says, highly subjectively. Zara is clearly not in line with Hong Kong society "to stop violence and restore order," the newspaper stated.All that from four stores opening a little late.Zara said in a Chinese social media post on Weibo that it "never expressed any views or took any actions" supporting the strike. Still wincing from an episode in which it listed Taiwan as a separate entity from China on its e-commerce site, it said it supports China's sovereignty.While these attacks work amazingly well in China, where the media is state-controlled, it's not yet clear how the white-terror tactics to eliminate dissent will go down overseas. Besides this overt editorial content, there's plenty of other busying by Beijing to paint Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators as radical rioters directed by the CIA and Britain's MI6.YouTube pulls a lot of plugsYouTube has now disabled 210 channels that had uploaded coordinated disinformation about events in Hong Kong. YouTube, owned by Alpahbet Inc.  , follows Twitter Inc.  and Facebook Inc.  in taking down content that purportedly came from individual users whom the companies concluded were actually fronts for Chinese government propaganda. Twitter said it has "reliable evidence to support that this is a coordinated state-backed operation."The Zara attack is weird enough that it should backfire. Zara is run by Spanish parent company Inditex  , the world's largest fashion retailer. I doubt any management at any level of this Galician company has taken a strong stance on the protests in Hong Kong. Its shares haven't budged much, down 1.2% in this week's trade. But they're worth watching if an online boycott, already launched in China, intensifies.Zara may well have simply taken the very sensible step of closing stores near increasingly violent demonstrations, as many other companies have done. Reuters  explaining that the stores delayed opening because staff had trouble getting to work due to strike-induced transport disruption, and that all stores eventually opened later on Monday.The Global Times instead jumps to the conclusion that the management of Zara Hong Kong is "willing to make a special show" of supporting the strikers and thinks "some of the risk is worth it.""Zara needs to make a solemn explanation and correct its own practices, giving a serious response to those who are patriotic to Hong Kong and China as well as the general public on the mainland," the Global Times opinion piece said. It's bizarre enough to be worth a read .White terror on the riseThere are other forms of white terror. The Hong Kong police timed seven arrests of prominent activists such as Joshua Wong and even three Hong Kong lawmakers to occur the night before a major demonstration that the cops deemed illegal. It was a clear warning not to take part.The police claimed the timing of the arrests was a "coincidence," even though the arrests were for differing crimes alleged to have occurred at different times. The head of the Hong Kong Court Prosecutors Association  to all Justice Department staff accusing the police of lying, which he says is a consistent pattern in recent months that will harm the city's justice system.Most damning of all is an  . It outlines that the Hong Kong government drafted various ideas for ways to defuse the time bomb in Hong Kong and address the five demands made by protestors. All the solutions were forbidden by Beijing, whose representatives, surely directed by President Xi Jinping, said the Hong Kong government could never make any concessions at all.The story was written by two of my former colleagues at Reuters, James Pomfret and Greg Torode, whom I can assure you are both excellent newshounds. It quotes three independent sources corroborating the events. It is proof that the "One Country, Two Systems" model by which Hong Kong is supposed to have a high degree of autonomy, and govern itself, is nothing more than a public relations sham.I don't doubt their account at all. To the Global Times, however, the story is a "so-called" exclusive and the "Global Times has since learned the Reuters story is fake."Unidentified for good reasonThe Global Times, in another Opinion piece , offers no proof that any part of the Reuters story is fake, inaccurate or untrue. Instead, it merely points out that the three sources who corroborated the account are all unidentified. "It is believed the unnamed sources are fabricated, or they are fake news conspirators," the newspaper says, offering up something it "believes" as incontrovertible truth.The sources are unidentified because, if they are in China, they might well get executed for treason. You can't criticize the Communist Party in that way or leak "state secrets," particularly to foreign reporters, something that would surely be termed espionage.Indeed, the Global Times editorial does accuse Reuters, part of Thomson Reuters  , of carrying out actions that "US and British intelligence agencies usually do." There are suspicions, the paper insists, that the "fake story was a backdoor maneuver by intelligence agencies with Reuters acting as their accomplice."Again, the newspaper said the Reuters report "was an attempt to interfere with Hong Kong affairs," and instead of a "so-called" exclusive is "really a malicious attempt to misrepresent the situation in HK and destroy anti-violence and peace-keeping efforts."The editorial explicitly calls out the United States and the United Kingdom for playing the "role of firm supporter for the protestors." And the two countries are now "igniting irrational emotion and manipulating local protestors like puppets to intervene with Hong Kong affairs."So China can meddle in Zara's choice to close its stores. It can attempt to use Western social media companies to spread misinformation and propaganda. But a bone fide news agency is somehow acting as an affiliate of the Western spy services.I think we are nearing the point where investors holding the shares of Chinese companies will have to make a call. Are they going to continue to invest in companies supporting an increasingly authoritarian and ruthless regime?Load-Date: September 4, 2019End of Document

It's unclear what the driving force is but there was a small positive in trade tensions after China's central government announced it would allow companies to purchase soybeans from the US tariff free. Spoos are trading about nine points higher to 3006 with a high of 3012.25 and a low of 3007.75.In Asia, both China and Japan closed up marginally. The small concession made by the Chinese government surrounding soybean purchases may have helped buoy the Shanghai. Japanese traders returned to their trading desks following a holiday weekend only to witness a lackluster day with the Nikkei closing up 0.1%. The yen was slightly lower against the dollar, lending mild support to equities.In Europe, the major bourses are mixed. The overall net changes are small and markets have been in a relatively tight trading range. After dismal PMI readings on Monday, Germany saw a relief with a slightly better than expected business confidence survey. The September IFO came in at 94.6, a tick higher than the expectation of 94.5 and up from 94.3 in August.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +13.010 yr Note: 1.72%USD/JPY: 107.77 +0.23EUR/USD: 1.0998 +0.0005Europe: FTSE -0.2% DAX +0.2% CAC +0.3%Asia: Hang Seng +0.2% Shanghai +0.3% Nikkei +0.1%Gold (1528.20 -3.30) Silver (18.67 -0.05) Crude (58.05 -0.59)17:23RILY B.

Disappointing flash manufacturing PMI readings out of the eurozone kept many buyers sidelined, but encouraging manufacturing activity in the U.S. helped abate early selling pressure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.1%), and Russell 2000 (-0.1%) finished little changed.The session began on a lower note, largely in response to those weaker-than-expected PMI readings overseas. Most notably, Germany's flash PMI for September fell deeper into contraction territory to its lowest reading (41.4) since 2009. The good news was that the Markit's flash manufacturing PMI reading for the U.S. increased to 51.1 from 50.3, reflecting the continued resiliency of the U.S. economy.The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its session low and crossed into positive territory as soon as European markets closed for trading at 11:30 a.m. ET. The broader market maintained this positive disposition throughout the afternoon but faded into the close.Most S&P 500 sectors finished within 0.3% of their unchanged marks. The consumer staples sector (+0.4%) outperformed the broader market, while the health care (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.4%) sectors underperformed.Apple (AAPL 218.72, +0.99, +0.5%) and most stocks within the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+1.0%) showed relative strength throughout the day. The semiconductor space bounced back from Friday's decline following reports indicating that officials from the U.S. and China described last week's trade talks as "productive" and "constructive," respectively.In corporate news, American Express (AXP 118.25, +1.45, +1.2%) announced a 120 million share repurchase program and increased its quarterly dividend 10%. Lululemon athletica (LULU 195.18, +5.88, +3.1) rose 3% after the stock was initiated with an Overweight rating at Piper Jaffray.The U.S. Treasury market reflected some lingering growth concerns as increased demand pushed yields lower. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.67%, and the 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 1.71%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.62. WTI crude rose 1.0%, or $0.60, to $58.64/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September, the FHFA Housing Price Index for July, and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +12.3% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDRussell 2000 +15.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.5% YTD16:22VER VEREIT announces public offering of 71.0 mln shares of common stock (9.73 -0.07)The company intends to use proceeds to pay amounts owed in connection with the settlement of certain litigation and for general corporate purposes.16:20MTDR Matador Resources announces receipt of six Bureau of Land Management drilling permits in western Antelope Ridge asset area (17.31 +0.28)The company had anticipated receipt of these permits late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Trump has the upper hand in the trade war with China. He can't back down nowCNN.comSeptember 24, 2019 Tuesday 8:59 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: PERSPECTIVESLength: 778 wordsByline: By James D. Schultz for CNN Business PerspectivesBodyChina is in trouble -- its people know it and President Trump knows it. In fact, Trump knew all along that his hardline stance against China would eventually dent its economy.Don't misunderstand. This is still a long play. There will be no partial deals or "meeting in the middle." Just because the Chinese have agreed to buy American soybeans and pork doesn't mean the president will soon be sprinting to the negotiating table. And that's exactly the right move.China's trade shenanigans date back decades, spanning multiple presidential administrations. Instead of just going along like past presidents, both Republicans and Democrats alike, someone needed to stand firm and wait for the Chinese economy to slowly collapse in on itself. And we're starting to see signs of that happening. China's industrial production in July was the weakest it has been in 17 years.China's weakening economy is due mostly to its trade war with the United States. China's leaders have only themselves to blame. They walked away from a deal in May, Trump's top trade negotiator, Peter Navarro, told Yahoo Finance. The centerpiece of deal, according to Navarro, was a 150-page agreement that addressed the so-called "seven verticals" or what Navarro calls China's "seven deadly sins": currency manipulation, cyberattacks, selling fentanyl to the US, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, product dumping and subsidized state-owned enterprises.The deal was essentially done and the Chinese backed out, Navarro said. Now, they have a choice. They can watch their economy continue to tank or sign the deal that was offered. Whether they want to admit it or not, the latter is their best option today ? and the same will be true six months from now.Trump has united the country -- Republicans and Democrats -- on China. According to an August Harvard/CAPS Harris Poll, 67% of American consumers believe it's necessary to confront China over its unfair trade policies.This is why Trump won the presidency in the first place. People in my home state of Pennsylvania, where President Trump won, in part, because of votes from Democrats who wear hard hats and carry lunch pails every day, cared a lot less about hot-button issues such as immigration and climate change than they did about their jobs moving overseas. The same goes for states like Wisconsin and Ohio.In the coming months, passing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will be a priority for the Trump administration. The trade agreement, which has bipartisan support, will replace the antiquated North American Free Trade Agreement and lead to fairer trade and economic growth for our country. It will also fulfill a promise Trump made on the campaign trail.The USMCA will, among other things, support farmers who do business with Mexico and Canada, protect US intellectual property and, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative, will provide the strongest and most comprehensive enforcement standards of any trade agreement. It will also send a clear message to China."By bringing North America together ... [the USMCA] will only strengthen the President's hand as we demand that China end the trade abuses that have characterized the decades of the past," Vice President Mike Pence told an audience Tuesday at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington D.C.This is one of the most important negotiations in American history and Trump has refused to capitulate in the face of opposition from both Democrats and Republicans as well as Wall Street. All three are waking up to the fact that Trump is playing it right -- a once loud drum beat has quieted. As China's economy atrophies, Beijing is going to be more inclined to make a deal.Still, negotiations with China are going to take time. It took decades for a president to finally decide that the Chinese had gamed the system long enough and it will come as no surprise that Beijing is holding out as long as possible. China might even try waiting Trump out in the hope that he loses the 2020 election and China can deal with a Democratic administration that will be more willing to compromise. That would be a considerable gamble by Beijing.But a watered-down or half-cooked deal won't get it done. Are we willing to settle for allowing the Chinese government to hack our computers, steal our intellectual property or sell dangerous amounts of fentanyl to the US?To answer those questions in the affirmative would be to ignore China's checkered trade history, to discredit the impact on those Americans who would continue to suffer most from China's misdeeds and to underestimate President Trump's negotiating power.Load-Date: September 26, 2019End of Document

Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti, prisoner in China, Sakharov Prize 2019CE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 24, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 714 wordsBodyThe European Parliament on Thursday awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Conscience to economics professor Ilhan Tohti, an advocate for the rights of the Uighur minority in China. Tohti, who tomorrow Friday turns 50, has been locked up in the Asian giant since he was sentenced to life in prison in a trial of just two days after being blamed for "separatism."The victorious candidacy was promoted by the liberal group Renew Europe. The prize is endowed with 50,000 euros, although first and foremost it is a powerful speaker to make known situations of injustice around the world. The other contenders for the award were the joint candidacy of three Brazilians: minority rights activist Marielle Franco and environmentalists Raoni and Claudelice dos Santos (promoted by social democrats, unitary and green left). And that of a group of Kenyan students who developed an application to combat female genital ablation, the choice of the group of conservatives and reformers.Eurochamber President David Sassoli will officially announce this noon in Strasbourg the winner of the highest recognition given by the Community institutions to people who have distinguished theself for their defence of human rights. The handover ceremony will be on December 18, but Ilhan Tohti will not be able to attend because he's behind bars.The election of the Uighur dissident, also awarded less than a month ago by the Council of Europe, sends a message to the Chinese government. Beijing strongly criticised the European Parliament for nominating it, but this pressure has had no effect on MEPs. If Moscow was uncomfortable last year for the same reason in awarding recognition to Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker imprisoned in Russia , released a month and a half ago , now the gaze has shifted towards the EU's second-largest trading partner to demand respect for rights Human.Known for his studies on the relations between uighurs and han (majority ethnicity in China) and in favor of granting xinjiang autonomy, the Chinese authorities requisitioned all of Tohti's property and held him in jail for five years on charges of promote separatism. Xinjiang Governor Nur Bekri singled him out as one of the intellectual promoters of dissent, and labeled it a "broadcast of rumors and incendiary propaganda" through his Uyghur Online news portal, closed and blocked in 2008.One million Uighurs, the Turkmen-born Muslim minority, are held - most without trial - in re-education centres with which Beijing has sown the territory, according to unaccepted figures. The last case that transcended was that of Abdurehim Heyit, one of the great contemporary poets and musicians of Uighur culture, which had been unknown since 2017. His followers denounced him as one of the Muslims that China has locked up in prisons and re-education camps in that region to combat extremism. "The Uighur population has been the subject of unprecedented repression by the Chinese government in recent years because of its ethnic identity and unique religious beliefs," they criticise from the Liberal group of the Eurochamber.Three Brazilian activists and a group of Kenyan students, finalistsUnlike the last two years, when Ukrainian Sentsov and the Venezuelan opposition confirmed their favoritism, this time there was no clear candidate for Sakharov. On the table were three Brazilian activists. Marielle Franco was born and raised in a favela, whose assassination generated a strong upheaving in Brazil and made it a symbol of opposition to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for her rejection of the paramilitary militias that dominate the state ofRiver. And environmentalists Raoni and Claudelice dos Santos involved in the fight for the preservation of the Amazon just at a time when the EU has a tense relationship with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on the best way to protect the jungle, considered one of the planet's big lungs.The other option was that of Kenyan students Stacy Owino, Cynthia Otieno, Purity Achieng, Mascrine Atieno and Ivy Akiny. All five developed an application that allows young women to seek medical and legal aid before or after genital ablation, a practice that more than 200 million living girls and women have suffered according to the World Health Organization 500, 000 in Europe.Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

NBA's Silver says China crisis triggered 'substantial' lossesStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 18, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS; Pg. 1Length: 449 wordsByline: Sidney GuerreroBody"We express strong indignation on and firm opposition to the US House of Representative's passage of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act", the ministry's spokesman, Geng Shuang, said in a statement.Silver drew criticism for the NBA's initial reaction to Morey's tweet.But Silver said Thursday that the league had a responsibility to defend freedom of speech.The league and some of its players, including LeBron James, seemed to side with China over Morey and the protesters.Silver also said he isn't sure what will happen to the NBA's relationship with China, which has been growing steadily over the last three decades.Google streaming game service Stadia launches November 19Google states: "At launch , wireless play with the Stadia Controller is only available on TV using a Chromecast Ultra ". Google Stadia will open its servers on November 19, marking the official launch of Google's cloud gaming ambitions."There was no regret directed to the government (but instead) to our fans, hundreds of millions of them in China".Four-time NBA MVPLebron James has been painted by many of his critics as a hypocrite who was more concerned with selling shoes in China than supporting the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. "It allowed guys not to be able to go on their own and obviously, yes, a lot of people had some business to take care of while they were over there, too, business on basketball, but with the cancellation of so many different events and so many different appearances it allowed us to be together, all of us, just our whole team". "Stand With Hong Kong", prompted a furious backlash in China and Mr Silver said the Chinese government had called for Mr Morey to be sacked. Morey has not been rebuked publicly by the league, and Silver has said that the league will support his freedom of expression."But if people believe we shouldn't be engaged in commerce in China, or frankly in other places in the world where they don't approve of their practices or government, OK, but then, at some point, I look to the American government. And if that's ultimately how our government feels we should be dealing with China, again, we are a USA company".Silver said on Thursday (Friday NZT) that the word "regrettable" was "modifying the fact that we'd upset our Chinese fans".But Silver feared that the NBA's 15-year effort to build cultural ties with China and expand the game's reach there had been undermined by the Morey dispute. James, who has a lifetime contract with sports apparel company Nike, also has much to gain, or lose, with the NBA's popularity in the East Asian country.Load-Date: October 18, 2019End of Document

China accuses US of 'economic bullying' over equipment banAssociated Press Financial WireOctober 29, 2019 Tuesday 10:13 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 334 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China on Tuesday accused the U.S. of "economic bullying behavior" after U.S. regulators cited security threats in proposing to cut off funding for Chinese equipment in U.S. telecommunications networks.China would "resolutely oppose the U.S. abusing state power to suppress specific Chinese enterprises with unwarranted charges in the absence of any evidence," Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters at a daily briefing."The economic bullying behavior of the U.S. is a denial of the market economy principle that the U.S. has always advertised," Geng said, adding the U.S. actions would "undermine the interests" of U.S. businesses and consumers, especially in rural areas."We would like to urge the U.S. once again to stop abusing the concept of national security," Geng said.The Federal Communications Commission votes next month on whether to bar telecom companies from using government subsidies to pay for networking equipment from Huawei and ZTE.The move mostly affects small, rural companies, since larger U.S. wireless companies do not use equipment from the two Chinese firms.The agency is also exploring the impact of requiring companies to rip out their current Huawei and ZTE equipment, a demand a trade group for small rural wireless carriers has said would cost up to $1 billion.The government is seeking comments on how it can help companies financially if they're required to do that. Bills in Congress have proposed setting $700 million to $1 billion aside for telecom companies to replace their networks.The U.S. government says Huawei, the world's biggest supplier of telecom gear and No. 2 smartphone manufacturer, poses an espionage threat. It has presented no evidence of its equipment being used for spying by the Chinese government and both Huawei and ZTE have denied their equipment is used for such purposes.The U.S. government also has been pressuring allies to ban Huawei from their networks and has restricted exports of U.S. technology to Huawei.Load-Date: October 30, 2019End of Document

Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 13:00 ETBriefing.comOctober 16, 2019 Wednesday 1:05 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc. All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 17248 wordsBodyHourly In Play (R)Updated: 16-Oct-19 13:00 ET12:59TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to report overnight (50.76 +0.37)Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 50.76, +0.37, +0.7%) will report its Q3 results overnight, followed by management's conference call tomorrow at 2:00 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the contract chip manufacturer to report a 7.9% yr/yr increase in EPS to TWD3.71 on a 9.8% yr/yr increase in revenue to TWD285.80 bln. TSM has had a very good showing since the release of its Q2 results on July 18. The stock has surged 22% since then, having climbed nearly 15% over the past month. The semiconductor industry has not fully recovered from the sharp slowdown at the end of 2018, but TSM has been able to withstand that weakness due in part to its size as well as expectations for an imminent rebound in activity. Most recently, shares received a boost from reports of stronger than expected sales of the iPhone 11, which imply increased production of components. TSM reportedly expects that global shipments of 5G smartphones will reach 300 mln units in 2020. Last quarter, the company reported a slight decrease in inventory, which reached a record during Q1. Additional progress on inventory reduction would go a long way toward justifying the recent rally.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing trades at 20.9x forward earnings expectations.12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks trade mixed; investors weigh macro, earnings newsThe stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.12:42EXC Exelon underperforming after sudden retirement of CEO of Exelon Utilities unit amid federal into lobbying activities (45.87 -1.19)Last night, the company announced that it has appointed Calvin G. Butler Jr., CEO of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company ("BGE"), as Interim CEO of Exelon Utilities, effective immediately. This appointment follows the retirement of Anne Pramaggiore, Senior Executive Vice President and CEO of Exelon Utilities, which is also effective immediately. Mr. Butler will continue to serve as CEO of BGE. The CEOs of Exelon's other utilities -- Joseph Dominguez, CEO of ComEd, Michael A. Innocenzo, CEO of PECO, and David M. Velazquez, CEO of Pepco Holdings -- will report to Mr. Butler. In addition, Exelon Utility CEO staff heads Val Jensen, Carim Khouzami and Mike Kormos will also report to Mr. Butler moving forward. Earlier this month, the company disclosed that it received a second grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois that requires production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities, including Illinois State Senator Martin Sandoval:As previously disclosed, Exelon Corporation and Commonwealth Edison Company (the "Companies") received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, which required production of information concerning lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. On October 4, 2019, the Companies received a second grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois that requires production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities, including Illinois State Senator Martin Sandoval. "The Companies have cooperated fully with the U.S. Attorney and intend to continue to cooperate fully and expeditiously with any government requests or inquiries. On June 21, 2019, the Exelon Corporation Board formed a Special Oversight Committee, consisting solely of independent directors, to oversee the Companies' cooperation and compliance with the subpoena, any further action taken by the U.S. Attorney and any resulting actions that may be required or recommended. The Special Oversight Committee has engaged independent outside counsel to advise and assist the Committee."According to The Chicago Tribune, Pramaggiore is reportedly a focus of the ongoing federal probe.Following the developments, Mizuho (Neutral rated) lowered their price target from $49 to $47 and cautioned that "[p]otential grand jury indictments of Exelon lobbyists in the Madigan/Sandoval investigations could derail attempts by the company to obtain passage of legislation in Illinois next year."12:07COMM Commscope: German Federal Patent Court has issued decisions upholding the validity of important CommScope patents that had been challenged by a competitor, COMLAB (11.51 +0.18)At an October 9 oral hearing, the German Federal Patent Court rejected challenges by COMLAB regarding the validity of the German part of European Patent EP1022849B1 (Action No. 5 Ni 6/17 (EP)) owned by CommScope's affiliate Andrew Wireless Systems. The Federal Patent Court already upheld the German part of European Patent EP2180605B1 in a decision dated March 27, 2019 (Action No. 6 Ni 23/17 (EP)). COMLAB filed appeal against the Federal Patent Court's decision that is now pending before the Federal Supreme Court (X ZR 84/19) and can appeal the most recent decision.12:03IBM IBM Q3 Earnings Preview; All eyes on Red Hat follow through (141.78 -1.22)Information technology giant IBM is slated to release Q3 results tonight after the bell with a conference call scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. ET.The Capital IQ Consensus Estimate for IBM's Q3 EPS stands at $2.66 (vs $3.42 a year ago) on revenue declines of 2.5% to $18.29 bln.This quarter may be a tricky one to judge based on the incoming accounting of the Red Hat deal (closed last quarter).At the company's August 2 Red Hat update event, management outlined guidance for 2020-2021:Revenue growth of MSD at constant currency; Operating pre-tax income growth of HSD; FCF >100% realization; a leverage ratio consistent with mid-to-high single A range.Management also updated 2019 operating EPS guidance for at least $12.80 (vs. at least $13.90 as standalone).What's more, the company sees the Red Hat deal as accretive to operating EPS by the end of year two.One of the questions investors are hankering to get an answer to is: has management righted the ship? Recall that last quarter IBM's largest segment by sales, Global Technology Services, reported a 6.7% decline to $6.8 bln. Obviously, the segment is a focal point purely based on size alone, but the troubles weren't just last quarter. In Q1 the GTS segment saw revenue declines of 7%.IBM steps into the Q3 report with a $126 bln market capitalization and trades at about 11.5x forward earnings estimates.12:03SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Achillion Pharma (ACHN) rises on all-cash acquisition deal -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersACHN (6.25 +71.23%): To be acquired by Alexion (ALXN) for an all-cash initial consideration of approx. $930 mln, or $6.30/share; potential additional contingent considerations, which hinge on clinical and regulatory developments such as FDA approval of danicopan and ACH-5228 Phase 3 initiation, could elevate the amount payable to co's shareholders to $8.30/share. Alexion looks forward to applying its "development expertise" to co's oral Factor D inhibitors in an endeavor to unlock the approach's potential and deliver benefits to patients. The stock moves to its highest levels in almost three years. ENDP (4.22 +20.91%): Touched up to three-month highs on higher than average volume; drug manufacturers generally outperform today in concert with reports that various sector names (JNJ, ABC, MCK, CAH, TEVA...) have made proposals regarding or are in talks concerning settlement of opioid litigation. AUPH (5.13 +9.85%): Continued strength; co today reported that the last patient study visit has occurred in the AURORA Phase 3 lupus nephritis study of voclosporin; efficacy and safety results from the study remain on-track to be reported by the end of the fourth quarter, and co anticipates that disclosure of the results will be "followed by the necessary preparations to submit an NDA for voclosporin during the first half of 2020." The AURORA II continuation study is also reportedly progressing as planned.Small Cap LosersAPHA (4.99 -8.1%): After moving higher by circa 25% yesterday following its Q1 earnings report. The cannabis sector generally cools off. ATNX (10.17 -8.3%): Drops to new five-month lows on higher than average volume. The stock has now moved lower by circa 16% month-to-date and trades lower by more than 50% from its July highs. NIO (1.46 -5.81%): Declines on moderately high volume; items of interest for co and the EV space this week have included Chinese new energy vehicle sales results for September and rumors from a reporting source in China that co was in talks regarding a factory investment.12:02PS Pluralsight (+2.7%) bucking weakness among software stocks after hiring former Salesforce (CRM) CIO, and then EVP of N.A. sales Ross Meyercord as Chief Revenue Officer (16.97 +0.46)The stock is down more than 40% since missing billings estimates and guiding down third quarter revenue, citing sales execution issues.11:44CSX CSX to report this evening (68.90 -0.27)Rail carriers CSX (CSX 68.90, -0.27, -0.4%) and Union-Pacific (UNP 163.73, +0.59, +0.4%) will report their Q3 results between today's closing bell and tomorrow's open. CSX will report this evening, followed by management's conference call at 16:30 ET, while Union-Pacific's report will be released tomorrow morning, followed by a conference call at 8:45 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects CSX to report a 2.9% yr/yr decrease in EPS to $1.02 on a 4.7% yr/yr decrease in revenue to $2.98 bln. The Capital IQ consensus expects Union-Pacific to report a 7.4% yr/yr increase in EPS to $2.31 on a 4.7% yr/yr decrease in revenue to $5.65 bln. Both rail carriers are among the 20 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Another DJTA component, J.B. Hunt Transportation Services (JBHT 114.99, +3.39, +3.0%) reported weaker than expected Q3 EPS yesterday, coupled with slightly better than expected revenue. CSX trades about 15% below its record high from May while UNP is about 10% below its own record from August. Like JBHT, CSX and UNP are likely to lament the current operating environment, considering weekly Rail Traffic reports from the Association of American Railroads have consistently pointed to yr/yr declines in traffic between 5% and 10%. September saw yr/yr carload decreases in 14 out of 20 commodity categories after 12 out of 20 commodity categories showed yr/yr declines in August. CSX was downgraded to Neutral at JPMorgan on October 4 while UNP was upgraded to Overweight at Atlantic Equities. UNP CFO reaffirmed the company's guidance for FY19 operating ratio below 61% on September 4. The CFO did note that the company now expects volume in the second half of 2019 to decline in the mid-single digits while previous guidance called for a decrease of about 2%.CSX trades at 15.8x forward earnings expectations while UNP trades at 16.9x forward estimates.11:38SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACHN, ACM, ARNC, ASC, ATKR, BHE, BLD, BLDR, BMCH, BZH, CASH, CBPO, CCS, CELG, CHTR, CNS, DE, DEA, DLTR, DOCU, IBP, INFO, INXN, IRT, JBL, KBH, KN, KOD, KSU, LBRDK, LEN, LGIH, MAS, MDC, MTH, MTZ, NFBK, ODFL, PHM, RETA, SHW, SNX, TECD, TMCX, TMHC, TPH, VICI, WD, WMSStocks that traded to 52 week lows: DERM, DT, FLDM, GTYH, HEP, ICUI, LBRT, LNDC, PRQR, RVLV, SSTI, TACO, TEUM, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: DCOM, PDFSThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: BSTC, FULC, NGVC, NPK, RMNIETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWT, ITB, PALL, PSK, XHB11:35Events and Conferences TomorrowImage Sensors Auto Americas 2019 (Oct 17-18)Scheduled to appear: INFO, XLNX, LYFT, SNEPMA Fresh Summit Conference & Expo 2019 (Oct 17-19)Scheduled to appear: AGFSAmong company updates: Sanderson Farms (SAFM) investor day at 20:30 ET11:30DT Dynatrace (-4%): Recent IPO falls to record low as software stocks come under pressure following tepid Workday (WDAY -12%) Analyst Day (17.41 -0.79)11:28XLF Money Center Comparables- Morgan Stanley reports tomorrow before the market opensMorgan Stanley will report earnings tomorrow before the open with a conference call to follow at 8am ET.Current Capital IQ consensus stands at EPS of $1.12 (-4% yr/yr), Net Income at $1.80 bln (-10% yr/yr), on Revenues of $9.63 bln (-2% yr/yr).MS results will be compared to peers.

Best in class for net income.C and GS still remain the cheapest valuation on a Book basis.BAC tops on equity performance, JPM on FICC.Loan growth led by BAC and C.11:01TALKX Market Briefing: Offsetting news keeps market in checkNot a great deal of conviction on the part of buyers and sellers in the early going, as the major indices are little changed.The earnings news has been relatively good, yet the macro news has been relatively bad. The two seem to be canceling each other out to a large extent, which is keeping the major indices in check.The outsized moves have been reserved for individual stocks with news, like Bank of America (BAC 30.45, +0.72, +2.4%) and United Airlines (UAL 90.08, +2.20, +2.5%), both of which reported better than expected earnings results. Accordingly, there hasn't been a lot of movement at the sector level.Seven sectors are up and four are down, with changes ranging from a 0.6% decline (information technology) to a 1.0% increase (materials).In terms of the macro hangups, they include the weaker-than-expected retail sales numbers for September, reports that a Brexit deal compromise between the EU and UK might not come to fruition before the Oct. 31 deadline, and misgivings about the completion of the "phase one" trade deal with China.The latter has stemmed from news that the U.S. House passed measures that support the Hong Kong protesters, which prompted a warning from China that it will respond with countermeasures if the U.S. Senate also passes those measures and the legislation ultimately becomes law.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are flat; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%.10:03VRRM Verra Mobility to acquire Pagatelia; terms not disclosed (13.99 -0.03)Pagatelia is a European leader in electronic tolling throughout Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy.

In Study 202 (Rx nave patients), greater mean log10 declines in HBV DNA (5.27 vs 3.99; p=0.017) and RNA (2.34 vs 0.61; p<0.001) were achieved with 731+Nrtl (entecavir) versus entecavir alone. In Study 201 (Nrtl-suppressed patients), the proportion of patients on 731+Nrtl versus Nrtl alone achieving DNA target not detected (TND) was 69% vs 0% (p<0.001), and the proportion of patients achieving RNA <35 U/mL whose RNA was less than 35 U/mL at baseline was 52% vs 0% (p=0.0013) respectively. In Study 211, there are 64 HBeAg+ patients currently on extended treatment beyond 24 weeks. Among the 27 HBeAg+ patients receiving 731+Nrtl in Study 201, 41% (11/27) have now achieved DNA TND along with RNA <35 U/mL and HBeAg <1 IU/mL. At their last timepoint, Study 202 patients now in Study 211 (n=22) have demonstrated mean DNA and RNA declines of 6.1 and 3.0 logs, respectively, with observed mean log changes of more than or equal to 0.6 for HBeAg (11 patients more than or equal to 0.5, 4 patients more than or equal to 1.0), >0.8 log for HBcrAg (7 patients more than or equal to 1.0, 3 patients more than or equal to 2.0) and more than or equal to 0.4 log for HBsAg (7 patients more than or equal to 0.5, 3 patients more than or equal to 1.0). 731 continues to exhibit a favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients treated for up to 1 year, with only mild/moderate adverse events and lab abnormalities, and only a single discontinuation due to a Grade 1 rash. The combination of 731+NrtI results in faster and deeper declines in HBV DNA and RNA than NrtI alone, as well as subsequent declines in the surrogate markers of cccDNA (pgRNA, HBeAg and HBcrAg) predictive of cccDNA pool depletion, and HBsAg. The emergent data supports the continued development of 731. ABI-H2158 -- The Second-Generation Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Core Inhibitor (CI) ABI-H2158 is Associated with Potent Antiviral Activity in a 14-Day Monotherapy Study in HBeAg-positive Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)Abstract Summary: The Phase 1b study is enrolling sequential cohorts of 9 patients and each cohort will be randomized to receive 2158 or placebo (7:2) QD for 14 days in a blinded manner. Dosing in the 1st cohort (100 mg) has been completed. In patients receiving 2158, mean declines from Baseline to Day 15 in HBV DNA and RNA levels were 2.3 log10 IU/mL [range 1.7 -- 3.0] and 2.1 log10 IU/mL [range 1.5 - 2.7] respectively. No serious AEs, dose limiting toxicities or premature discontinuations were reported. Three patients reported a total of 5 mild, drug-related AEs that recovered without intervention; dizziness, fatigue, rash, headache and upper abdominal pain. Treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities were infrequent, mild and transient, with no ALT elevations Grade more than or equal to 1 in severity. Day 14 plasma 2158 Cmax and AUC0-24hr were 3,390 ng/mL and 46,100 hr*ng/mL, respectively. Results from the initial 100 mg low dose of ABI-H2158 cohort demonstrated potent antiviral activity, a favorable safety profile when administered for 14 days, and support once daily dosing in CHB patients.07:43PAG Penske Auto increases quarterly dividend to $0.41/share from $0.40/share (45.08 )07:38ABT Abbott Labs reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q4 EPS in-line (81.98 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.84 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.84; revenues rose 5.5% year/year to $8.08 bln vs the $8.1 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus, and 7.6 percent on an organic basis including 3.8% in nutrition, 6.6% in diagnostics, 7.9% in established pharma and 10.6% in medical devices.

This change in top line performance, coupled with lower factory absorption, higher operating expenses arising largely from acquisitions, and other factors, will adversely affect net income for the period. Thus, management expects that quarterly earnings per share are likely to be less than half of the [$0.23] consensus estimate and will provide conclusive data on that subject in its next earnings release."Focusing on full year 2019 results, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 6% year-over-year with mixed performance among our major markets. International sales should increase by about 27% for the full year. However, our domestic sales will likely decrease by about 5% on a per annum basis, which we believe is consistent with industry-wide forecasts showing domestic markets receding by 6% to 12%. With these considerations in mind, we are revising our full year 2019 net sales forecast downward to ~$480 million [from $500 mln vs. $499 mln consensus]. Other previously forecasted financial metrics relating to 2019 remain unchanged since our last earnings call."16:29LW Lamb Weston forms joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina (75.50 -0.34)Lamb Weston has formed a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina to serve the nearly 2-billion-pound South American market.

SCO SECRETARY-GENERAL ATTENDS THE 7TH CHINA-CENTRAL ASIA COOPERATION FORUM IN NANNINGStates News ServiceOctober 18, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1592 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Beijing, China BodyThe following information was released by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):On 17-18 October 2019, Nanning (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, GZAR, China) hosted the 7th China-Central Asia Cooperation Forum titled Cooperation in the Sea and on the Land: Fostering Innovative Development.The opening of the forum, organised by the SCO China Committee on Neighbourhood, Friendship and Cooperation, was followed by a plenary session and panel discussions on cooperation in international logistics and e-commerce; joint development of smart cities; and cooperation on the use of satellite navigation.Vice-Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), President of the All-China Women's Federation, Chairperson of the Chinese Committee of the SCO on Neighbourhood, Friendship and Cooperation Shen Yueyue, GZAR Communist Party Secretary Lu Xinshe and SCO Secretary-General Vladimir Norov spoke at the opening ceremony.Shen Yueyue and Lu Xinshe noted in their remarks that cooperation between China and the Central Asian countries is growing faster every year, making it possible to achieve significant practical results in all areas of multilateral and bilateral cooperation.Vladimir Norov emphasised that every year this forum an important and respective platform for a broad exchange of views between China and Central Asia contributes to the emergence of new ideas and approaches for the development of mutually beneficial and constructive cooperation, as well as ever closer contacts and ties between representatives of the political, public, business and academic circles of our countries.Friendship between Central Asia and China and mutually beneficial political, trade, cultural and humanitarian ties have deep historical roots going back more than 2,000 years.Our countries have been tightly bound by the Great Silk Road, which has played an important role in their shared history and culture and is now an integral part of our historical memory.Central Asia has been a crossroads of civilisations, cultures and strategically important transport routes for millennia, Vladimir Norov said. Today's countries in the region are the heirs to the great ancient states and peoples who gave the world unique achievements in mathematics, astronomy, medicine, philosophy and art. Their value for the development of humankind is difficult to overestimate.It is especially worth noting that in recent years, cooperation between the countries of Central Asia has made rapid progress, and important results have been achieved in all areas of joint activity.The region has also become more united, stable, economically sustainable and attractive for foreign investment.The SCO Secretary General pointed out that Central Asia is the geographical centre of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation; it is the core of the SCO and an important focus for its activities. The Bishkek Declaration, adopted at the SCO Summit in 2019, notes that its member states support the efforts of the Central Asian countries to deepen cooperation in various fields, welcome the adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution of 22 June 2018 on "Strengthening regional and international cooperation to ensure peace, stability and sustainable development in the Central Asian Region" and the second consultative meeting of the leaders of Central Asian states in Tashkent in 2019.The Belt and Road Initiative, launched in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping and first presented in the capital of Kazakhstan, is especially significant for strengthening mutually beneficial cooperation between Central Asia and China. Linking the Belt and Road with the national economic development strategies of the SCO member states is consistent with the goals, objectives and principles of our organisation, as well as with what we know as the Shanghai Spirit. This global initiative holds the potential for changing the world for the better, creating new opportunities for cooperation not only among the peoples of the SCO countries, including Central Asia and China, but also for states on three continents.The SCO countries are aware of the need to continue their cooperation to ensure sustainable development and the general prosperity of the region and the SCO space. In this regard, more intensive cooperation between the countries of Central Asia and China in the following priority areas is highly relevant.First, Central Asia and China need to expand trade, economic cooperation and investment. According to analysts, last year's trade between the SCO member states totaled some $305 billion, or a mere 5 percent of their total trade with foreign countries.This shows a demand for joint projects in manufacturing and high-tech industries, modernisation of industry, simplification of customs procedures and the promotion of e-commerce.According to some estimates, e-commerce currently accounts for about 20 percent of global trade and is expected to reach 25 percent by 2025.Second, in the modern world, the development of cooperation in areas such as digitalisation and information and communications technologies creates a large number of jobs, especially for young people and women, and has become an effective mechanism for people to avoid poverty.This year, the SCO Summit in Bishkek approved the Concept for Cooperation between the SCO Member-States in the Sphere of Digitalisation and Information and Communication Technologies drafted at the initiative of the presidents of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.China holds one of the leading positions in the world in terms of ICT development. Access to China's experience and technology can be helpful for all Central Asian countries in bridging the gap and achieving the benefits of digitalisation.Third, it is important to conduct consistent joint work to strengthen the region's transshipment potential, to build modern multi-modal transport and logistics hubs and create a modern system of transport routes to give the Central Asian countries access to seaports.Rail transport from China to Kazakhstan, Russia and on to Europe, Central Asia and the Gulf is now on the rise; at the same time, only 1 percent of freight is actually transported by rail, while the remaining 99 percent goes by sea. So the planned Uzbekistan-Kyrgyzstan-China railway is going to become an important link in the regional transport network as part of the East-West project, which, along with the North-South sub-regional corridor, will give the landlocked countries in Central Asia access to the markets of Europe, East and Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the ports on the Mediterranean.During a recent expert discussion, the Chinese offered proposals on potential railway links for the project, which will provide the shortest route from China to Europe and the Middle East. According to experts, shipping at least 5 million tonnes of goods per year will fully cover the costs of construction.It is also important to attract Afghanistan to transport projects between the Central Asian countries and China; this should be a contributing factor to that country's stabilisation and economic development. The Hairatan to Mazar-i-Sharif railway and the planned Mazar-i-Sharif-Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif-Peshawar lines will form a new transit corridor with access to the Iranian, Pakistani and Indian railways and to the ports of Chabahar and Gwadar. It is symbolic that the first China-bound Afghan export shipment of 41 containers took off on 5 September 2019 from the Hairatan station via the Friendship Bridge and the railways of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.Fourth, global climate issues such as the drying of the Aral Sea, the glaciers melting faster, desertification and soil erosion amid regional population growth call for priority implementation of joint agricultural projects based on modern water-saving technologies, innovative farming and desert greening.Fifth, the growing cooperation in tourism, the improvement of infrastructure and development of new cross-border tourist options will promote small business and consequently, improve living standards in Central Asia.Today, the SCO cultural space has 143 sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List, which are a powerful source for the development of tourism.And yet, the tourism potential of the SCO, which is 44 percent of the global population, is not being fully exploited.In this regard, the SCO Secretariat, with the support of the member states, has launched a series of presentation events as part of the Eight Wonders of the SCO project, which includes one tourist landmark from each SCO country.The presentations have already been held in Beijing, Xi'an, Dushanbe and Helsinki.The share of e-commerce in global tourism currently exceeds 30 percent of transactions. In this respect, the programme of smart tourism development in the SCO space, including in the countries of Central Asia, plays a paramount role.Other speakers at the opening session of the forum included First Deputy Prime Minister of Tajikistan Davlatali Said, Deputy Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Zamirbek Askarov, First Deputy Head of the Women's Committee of Uzbekistan Zulaykho Makhkamova, Director of Kazakhstan's China and Central Asia Studies Centre Ruslan Izimov, as well as high-ranking representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Thailand.The forum was attended by over 200 representatives from Chinese government ministries and agencies, business and academia, leading media outlets from China, Central Asia and the Caucasus, as well as representatives of ASEAN countries.Load-Date: October 22, 2019End of Document

Showcase USA Introduces U.S.-China Trade War Relief: Launch Program for Selling on Cross Border E-CommercePR NewswireSeptember 5, 2019 Thursday 8:31 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 675 wordsDateline: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 5, 2019 BodyPR NewswireCross border e-commerce is dramatically transforming the way foreign brands penetrate the Chinese market.

SECURITY RESEARCHERS FIND ANDROID BACKDOOR IN XI JINPING THOUGHT STUDY APPStates News ServiceOctober 14, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1122 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A patriotic app promoted by the Chinese Communist Party as a tool for ideological education contains a security backdoor enabling remote access to Android smartphones, security researchers have found."Study the Great Nation," or Xuexi Qiangguo in Chinese, has been aggressively promoted by the ruling party, government departments and state-owned enterprises in China, with more than 100 million users to date, according to government figures.The Huawei app store has reported more than 300 million downloads alone, with users taking part in political quizzes and study sessions, gaining scores that are compared with others in their social and professional circle.A recent investigation by the Open Technology Fund (OTF) and security researchers at Cure53 into the app found that it "contains code resembling a backdoor which is able to run arbitrary commands with superuser privileges."It is likely, judging from the code, that the backdoor was created and is maintained by Alibaba or Alibaba Cloud, the report said.It found that the backdoor would work on rooted devicessuch as smartphones running the Android operating systemto grant someone superuser privileges enabling them to change anything they wish on that particular device."Having superuser privileges gives you the power to do anything, such as download any software, modifying files and data, or install a keylogger," the OTF said in a statement on its website.The app scans for the ability to access the root of the phone, it said, meaning that phones running Linux-based systems like Android would be vulnerable."If successful, it would be able to receive and potentially execute commands," the statement said.Ever-widening effortsSince Chinese president Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, he has abolished term limits for the presidency, and is currently embarked on a second, indefinite term in office.His administration has engaged in ever-widening efforts to strengthen the Communist Party's grip on all forms of public expression, and the app represents one of the most ambitious forms of political indoctrination the ruling party has ever undertaken.At the heart of the app's content is the concept of Xi Jinping Thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, a hodgepodge of ideas that include strong nationalistic fervor in the form of "self-confidence," and a commitment to export the Chinese model of government around the world, in a direct challenge to "Western" liberal notions of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.According to the OTF, an affiliate of RFA, the Chinese government recently announced that the app will also deliver political testing to Chinese journalists, all of whom will be required to take a test of their loyalty to the party in order to have their press credentials renewed.The investigation by security researchers specifically focused on Android operating systems, which accounts for around 80 percent of the Chinese smartphone market.The study also found that Study the Great Nation actively scans to find other apps that are running on the user's device, including travel apps like TripAdvisor and Airbnb; chat apps like WhatsApp, Kakao Talk, Facebook Messenger, and Skype; navigation apps like Baidu maps and Uber; Amazon Kindle and various payment apps.The app also weakens encryption when it collects and transfers large amounts of personal user data, "seemingly by design," the study said.Additionally, the app collects general information such as the device's unique IMEI number, connection information, information about app usage sessions, and location, which is then sent to a domain owned by Alibaba."Log files are created daily, so it would appear that this information is collected and sent on a daily basis," the OTF statement said."Study the Great Nation boasts technical capabilities that go well beyond what it purports to do, and maintains a level of access that no app would normally have over a user's device," it said. "It is deeply concerning and alerting that the app could possibly obtain a pervasive level of access and the ability to run arbitrary commands on a user's device."Blocking digital totalitarianismTaiwanese political commentator Yeau-Tarn Lee said the world should start thinking about how to block the digital version of the CCP's totalitarianism."If we are to reevaluate our view of the Chinese Communist Party, everyone needs to be very clear about one thing: that the top-down dictatorship of the regime is still the same," Lee told RFA."It is now engaged in a high-tech and evolving form of totalitarianism," he said. "We're not just talking about the manipulation of 1.3, or 1.4 billion people, but also the monitoring of what the rest of the world is doing."Netherlands-based commentator Lih Lii said the Chinese government is sensitive to the slightest perception of a threat to its power."The Chinese authorities can fully monitor users by accessing the privileges and data on their smartphones," Lih said. "I'm not surprised that Alibaba is involved in this, because it is a government-backed company.""But the brainwashing function [of this app] is still probably more important that its ability to control their private [data]," he said. "Everyone knows they are under total surveillance, but they dare not say a word about it to anyone, so this has a chilling effect."Cult of personalityU.S.-based legal expert Teng Biao said the app is part of Xi's bid to build a cult of personality around himself."This has been going on for a few years now," Teng told RFA. "Ever since Xi Jinping came to power, especially since he consolidated his power, they have rolled out mass political study on a huge scale to sculpt Xi's public image.""They are now engaged in a personality cult around Xi Jinping in every corner of China, and the language that we saw during the Mao era is now being revived," he said. "They have also been pushing people to download and install the Study the Great Nation app."The security researchers' findings come after the Chinese government mulls new regulations under which any Communist Party member who speaks against government policy, the socialist system, or who takes part in strikes, protests, demonstrations or religious activities "undermining national unity" will be expelled from the party.Sanctionable offenses will include posts, speeches, declarations or statements that openly oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, oppose the socialist system, and oppose the policies of the last few decades.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Xi Wang and Qiao Long for the Mandarin Service.

FCC Commissioner Carr Issues Remarks at Mobile World CongressTargeted News ServiceOctober 23, 2019 Wednesday 1:18 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4101 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LOS ANGELES, California BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following remarks by Commissioner Brendan Carr at the Mobile World Congress "The Year of 5G and Beyond":"Coming to events like these gives all of us in government the chance to learn more about the industries we regulate and the policies that will bring more broadband to more Americans. As I've said before, you don't want government officials regulating in the dark. This Commission has focused on modernizing our regulations, bringing sometimes 2G and 3G regs into the 5G era."So it's invaluable to hear from the inventors, the suppliers, the climbers, and the rest of you who work to connect Americans to each other and the world."2019 has been the Year of 5G. In January, I started using the hashtag #YearOf5G. Sadly, it did not go viral. But while the hashtag may not have taken off, the technology sure did. 2019 saw the first standards-based 5G deployments, which now cover over 30 American communities. That number will head above 40 by year's end. 5G brought fast home Internet access to places that had one or no choice for that vital service. Today, consumers can choose from three 5G phones and a host of other connected devices, with more to be unveiled in the coming months. In short, what engineers and scientists have been working on for a decade is coming to life. And it's about to change how we live, work, and connect."Most Americans know something about 5G by now. Some notion of the technology has escaped the telecom bubble. A PC Magazine poll conducted in April revealed that only five percent of respondents were not sure what 5G is--or at least were willing to cop to not knowing. A Harris poll from a few months earlier dug into what people thought 5G would mean to them.Nearly half thought 5G's lead characteristic would be faster downloads. About a third cited higher quality video streaming, and a quarter pointed to better voice and video calls. Overall, not bad, considering that we're just in Year One of the technology getting into the commercial marketplace.But clearly 5G is a lot more than those things. I don't think you would go to all of the trouble of inventing and deploying a new wireless standard for better FaceTime chats--let alone invest the quarter-trillion dollars that's projected over the next few years."So we need to do a better job of explaining 5G in plain terms. It's important that we meet this communications challenge. We have to shift our audience from those who are immersed in tech and telecom to ordinary people who aren't interested in the latest 3GPP release but who are very interested in how new tools can make their jobs more rewarding, their kids' schools more enriching, and their families closer."Part of the challenge is that people tend to underestimate the pace and nature of technological change. We suffer from a status quo bias. We tend to think that the next big thing will just be a faster version of what we have today. We can lack the vision to see the disruptive and transformational shift that an upgrade in technology will enable--the innovative new businesses it will support. Or, more importantly to everyday Americans, the pain points in our daily lives that will be eliminated."This is not a new phenomenon. We called the first cars "horseless carriages." Our vision can be anchored and limited by what we see in front of us today. And we have seen this story repeat itself throughout even modern shifts in technology."Think back 10 to 15 years ago. Back then, we were moving from 3G to 4G and providers were building out high-speed fiber lines on a new scale. Look at what was being written back then. Analysts and Bellheads alike were wringing their hands and doubting whether Americans would want to upgrade from copper to fiber. Articles were legion with headlines like "3G to 4G: Is it worth it?" Many people did not see any use cases for 4G beyond those already enabled by 3G. Sound familiar?"In fact, a lot of analysts were searching around for the "killer app" that would finally convince Americans to upgrade to broadband. What did some of the best minds in technology seize on back then? VoIP. A telecom consulting firm published a white paper arguing that VoIP would finally provide the necessary incentive for consumers to upgrade to broadband. The report said that not accounting for, and I quote, "rogue P2P companies such as Skype . . . [whose] calls are free," ditching the copper home line and adopting broadband-powered VoIP would save people $8 per month. This savings would pay for broadband, making the upgrade make sense."Everyone now knows what happened. And it's far more than VoIP. Look no further than the roughly $1 trillion app economy we now have. Look at all of the streaming services we enjoy today. Smartphones became one of the most rapidly adopted technologies in history. And all of this was powered by the first and world-leading 4G network that providers built out across America."It's amazing to look back today and realize that there was an entire class of telecom professionals and financial analysts who made the bear case that broadband wasn't worth the investment.These digital deniers didn't imagine how Venmo would transform banking. They were stuck in the era of walking to a brick-and-mortar bank, waiting in one of those rope lines to fill out deposit slips, and using those pens chained to the desks, perpetually out of ink. VoIP wasn't going to change that.The connection critics didn't predict what Uber would do for mobility. They were stuck in the era of arguing with a taxi dispatch about your cross-streets, quarrelling over the A/C and radio through that tiny hole in the plastic divider, and arguing about the fuel surcharge that suspiciously never seemed to go away. VoIP wasn't going to change that.The progress pessimists didn't foresee that Tinder would disrupt dating--how it would impact future generations; how it would literally create future generations. They were stuck in the era of mustering courage to actually talk to someone and ask them out on a date. What bleak, anxious times those were. VoIP wasn't going to change that."Yet past remains prologue. The VoIP-as-killer-app crowd is still with us. And they're still at it. They say we're already living the "golden age of wireless." They push back on the FCC's efforts to accelerate 5G builds through modernized infrastructure rules. They wring their hands over the 5G upgrade because they cannot see the life-changing innovations--the pain points in our daily lives that will be eliminated with this generational shift in technology. There is a magnetic attraction to the status quo, to be sure. But we need to lean into the future. We must meet the Gretzky test and move not to where the puck is but where the puck is going."Knowing all of this--knowing the lack of vision that has always been out there--we need to communicate and shift the conversation. We can do a better job of talking about the 5G use cases that will improve the lives of everyday Americans."The first and maybe most obvious way 5G will deliver tangible value to Americans is by offering them another choice for high-speed, home Internet. It's through their home Internet connection that they increasingly stream video content, so much so that broadband progress is often still measured by the Netflix test. It's the way kids do their homework; it's the way home businesses get off the ground. And whether it's widely realized or not, offloading traffic to home broadband is a key way that our wireless networks continue to perform and remain affordable."Many Americans feel like they have only one choice for this essential service, and this ticks them off. It seems to verge on un-American. When there are 70 flavors of sparkling water at the grocery store, they are not content with just one option for home Internet. And rightly so.When I talk to regular people who do not spend their lives pondering telecom policy, I can tell you they get very excited about simply having another choice. They are pumped about 5G delivering it. So it's great that home Internet is one wireless provider's first 5G offering. And another provider has pledged to offer 5G home Internet to nearly 30 million households."Beyond the home, there is a tremendous amount of investment and research going into VR and AR, and we know 5G's low latency will be a critical ingredient to those categories. Technologists are especially excited about VR and AR because at bottom they reduce friction between tech and living.Smartphones have changed so many aspects of our lives that many of us are never more than a foot or two away from our phones. A friction point is taking the phone out of our pockets and staring at them, which distracts us from what's going on around us--from living. Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple's Siri are trying to solve this problem with voice, but imagine if it could be solved visually with AR glasses or contact lenses. VR in turn advances AR's solutions a step further by collapsing distance, especially for spatial and hands-on experiences."But what does all of that mean to the Americans we serve? Let's think about common pain points in our own lives."For example, people hate going to grocery stores. I hate going to grocery stores. The problem is I need food. We all know that Peapod and Fresh Direct have put grocery selection and delivery online. Still, there's something useful in seeing all of the choices in front of you, and that's particularly true for fresh produce. Imagine putting on VR glasses, walking down a virtual grocery aisle--quickly, and without any other people around to hit you with their carts--looking at, picking up, and choosing items; instant check out, and immediate delivery."Home buying can be another pain point. Redfin and Zillow have made buying a house more accessible and have reduced transaction costs by bringing home data directly to the consumer. Yet few people would want to make the largest purchase of their lives without seeing the place first. This traditionally has required hiring an agent, scheduling an appointment, and devoting scarce weekend hours driving from open house to open house, rather than spending much more quality time with family. There's a group of start-ups right now focused on the tech and contracting to allow buyers to conduct their own self-guided tours of homes; but that only addresses part of the problem. What if the entire home buying experience could be done virtually? Feel the house's space and layout from across town or around the world. VR home-buying could make homes available to waves of new buyers while putting more pressure on transaction costs, which eat into families' equity. It's easy to see this solution's application to home design and remodeling--or any other kind of project that requires walking around a space."So many start-ups and established brands alike have tried to crack the code for selling clothes online. So far, they've done it on the back of free shipping and returns. Shipping can contribute 15 percent to an item's cost, and an exchange online often makes the sale unprofitable. Rent the Runway, the clothes rental unicorn, tries to solve this pain point by incenting subscribers to post to the app photos of themselves wearing the clothes. Yet even Rent the Runway and Bonobos have resorted to opening up retail locations in major cities so customers can try on clothes before making online orders. Imagine if VR could map your figure and allow you to turn around and see how the clothes fit you virtually."At Quantico today, our country's military and law enforcement officers are being trained using VR.Quantico has VR-equipped Humvees that simulate driving and firing weapons in hostile environments. We all get immediately how this is training that you can't learn from a book. Certain heavy artillery and rifle training also is done virtually today to increase safety and reduce costs. Imagine the applications for police, fire, ambulance, and other first responders."Or think about any education that's better done hands-on. Plumbers can read a manual on how to fix pipes, but nothing beats trying with your own hands. VR could allow a trainee to see and fix a problem in 3D, and some day with the development of advanced haptics, she or he could practice turning virtual pipes with connected gloves.Many tradesmen make solid middle-class livings, and reducing the time and cost of becoming a tradesman would give many an opportunity to improve their lives.The VR use case is just one chapter in the 5G story. By lowering barriers to education, we can provide opportunities to young people who, because of family circumstances or the unique way that they learn, wouldn't be able to fulfill their goals. By shrinking distances virtually, rural America can participate in Big City offerings in ways that would have required a move before.Kids who learn through more hands-on or immersive experiences can sit, virtually, in a medieval village and learn about the Middle Ages in an entirely new way. I just wouldn't recommend that for learning more about Dante's Inferno."But the 5G story is not just about these use cases. It's about the jobs that are created building the 5G platform. When I've been on the road, I've visited with this set of 5G workers. They're your coworkers--just not the ones in bespoke blazers clicking through Powerpoints. They're not in zip-up hoodies or sporting Beats headphones, either. Instead, I've had the privilege to hang out with your coworkers who wear hardhats and put on harnesses.They work with their hands. And without their work, none of the other 5G jobs and opportunities would exist.So I announced a jobs initiative a few months back that looks to community colleges as pipelines for 5G jobs. Over the course of a few weeks or months, community college programs can take someone with little to no skills today and train them up so they can land a good-paying job in the tower industry building out the next-gen infrastructure America needs for 5G. My initiative aims to stand up more community college programs like the one I learned about on the road in Aiken, South Carolina."The good news is that we're already seeing success. A few months back, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, I visited Southeast Technical Institute, and talked with the trade school's administrators about the opportunities that a tower training program could bring to the community. I am pleased to report that just a few weeks ago the school announced that they are starting a program this January for tower techs in partnership with VikorTeleconstruction."Now, the jobs and services I've been discussing will make up only the first wave of value that will be created in America using 5G.What's critically important to me is that as much of that value creation as possible occurs here, in America. I want those jobs, the education, the healthcare, and the productivity to benefit the Americans I serve. Much like America's dominance in 4G was critical to the success of Uber, Airbnb, and Venmo, I want our leading position in 5G to spawn the next wave of technology, here."Of course, the U.S. is not the only country that wants to benefit from superior 5G investment. Many of my regulatory counterparts very naturally want their countries to be on the leading edge of 5G.They want the investments, the benefits, and the economic opportunities that will flow from this next-gen platform. China is one country that wants far more than that. Beijing sees 5G as a chance to seize and then exert economic dominance for the next decade."And like the tech pessimists that doubt 5G will be a significant upgrade over 4G, there are some who doubt the U.S. can extend our global leadership in 4G into the 5G era. I do not share those doubts."So at the outset, let's review the facts. They confirm that the U.S. is winning the race to 5G.* The U.S. is home to the first commercial 5G deployment in the world.* 14 U.S. communities went live with commercial 5G in 2018, compared to zero in China.* More than 30 U.S. communities are live with commercial 5G today, compared to zero in China.* By year's end, commercial 5G service will be live in at least 42 U.S. communities.* By 2022, the U.S. will have more than double China's 5G adoption rate.* And one provider alone has committed to build out 5G to 99 percent of the U.S. population. I have heard no such plan out of China."While conceding that the U.S. is now in the lead, some see advantages in China's system. And I think we have to recognize that, at the end of the day, this is a competition between two very different systems of government, two very different views of the world."There are some who see advantages in China's centralized control. They point out that Beijing bureaucrats can snap their fingers and command that thousands of 5G cells be deployed seemingly overnight. They snap their fingers again, and spectrum is cleared and allocated--no need to fuss with incumbents or debate interference into satellite sensors that never left the ground."But when you scratch below the surface of those perceived advantages, the U.S. lead grows; our 5G leadership looks even more secure."Start with spectrum. Beijing has decided that 5G means mid-band, and only mid-band apparently. They've licensed zero high-band spectrum for 5G. That's a big problem for Beijing because high-band spectrum delivers the fiber-fast Internet speeds that are key to many 5G use cases, as we've seen already with 5G home Internet.High-band will be key for the massive amounts of capacity needed for VR, AR, and many other next-gen applications. Our approach in the U.S., in contrast, has been to put all spectrum bands to use and let the 5G builders and operators choose the right combination for the services Americans want. And that is why experts predict that the U.S. will have a faster 5G network than China."We have low-band spectrum for wide coverage, including across rural America. We have mid-band spectrum for fast mobile 5G. And we have high-band for the highest quality services, including the most high-band spectrum freed up anywhere in the world.We cannot rest on our laurels, to be sure. That's why I have pushed hard for at least 300 MHz of the C-Band to be cleared promptly for mobile use. That's why we have expedited a 3.5 GHz auction. And that's why we're pursuing more options, including in the 6 GHz band. This is demand-driven, not bureaucrat-driven, spectrum policy."Let's turn next to Beijing's vaunted infrastructure prowess. The state-owned wireless infrastructure company has a monopoly on tower builds. The country's three carriers are state-controlled.Their plans for deploying 5G are coordinated, reportedly scheduled in the next few weeks to honor China's National Day, when they celebrate the establishment of communist rule in China. The carriers are required to buy equipment from domestic suppliers at higher prices than charged by those same equipment providers when they sell outside China, providing an indirect subsidy in the form of pricing power and higher margins."This unity of action is perceived by some as a strength. State-controlled companies don't work through local zoning rules or local aesthetic requirements. They don't pause over environmental reviews or historic preservation. They don't even have the choice to negotiate with neutral host providers: the second and third-leading providers in China were told to collocate when deploying 5G. Beijing can act without debate and without resource limits. The argument goes that those are advantages over our democratic, free-market system."So how's that strategy working for China? On this one, you don't have to believe me. Instead, I'll just tell you about a Chinese tech article that I ran across two weeks ago, with the help of Google Translate."The Chinese outlet reported that local governments are bidding against each other to subsidize the build out of 5G. Shenzhen, the important commercial hub connected to Hong Kong, is handing out bonuses to providers that deploy 5G to the tune of $1,400 per 5G base station up to a total of over $20 million. A municipal government near Beijing did one better. It started with a 30 percent subsidy of companies' capex for deploying 5G, as well as expedited permitting. Its subsidies extend to a range of opex, as well. There are land use concessions that amount to rent subsidies. The government foots the 5G electric bill so that the price of power is about one-third of what we pay in the U.S. And it offers so-called 5G innovation incentives."These lavish subsidies result in more deployments, to be sure. But that is not success. It shouldn't surprise us that if the Chinese government gives wireless operators free money to build cells, more cells will be built. But that doesn't tell you anything about value; it doesn't tell you anything meaningful about the race to 5G. One of the predictable downsides to government throwing money at a project is that the money will not be spent efficiently or in response to consumer demand. And, in fact, the Chinese outlet's own article points this out. One provider built 5G cells but didn't turn them on. It literally slapped metal boxes onto poles but didn't plug them in. That's because the operation and maintenance costs of some of the cells don't justify their use, or as the article says, the cells appear to be "burning money." China is building a Potemkin Village to 5G."This shouldn't surprise any of us. What's happening in wireless in China has happened before. You can see it in the pristine, unused highways that cut through China's hinterland, and in the empty skyscrapers of China's ghost cities. China can run wasteful, debt-fueled construction projects better than anyone. And with unlimited government funding, you can build museums to bureaucrats' dreams that no one will visit. Would we rather have that in the U.S.? Would we rather have bridges to nowhere and smalls cells for no one?"To be clear, this failure--taking money from their own people to fund 5G cells that won't be used--is a systemic failure, not the failure of a particular bureaucrat or local government. The strategy's rot is at its core. If the Chinese government's version of the race to 5G is measured by the number of metal boxes it can attach to poles and sides of buildings, then it will throw up metal boxes, regardless of whether they're useful or even turned on. But China is not building the best 5G network in the world. It is not building the fastest 5G network in the world. And it is not capable of building one that responds to consumer demand."So at bottom, this is a competition between systems. And it's a familiar one. We already know how and why China will lose."In America, the private sector leads investment. You all lead the way. Having skin in the game makes investors more careful. It forces them to listen to everyday Americans, to create value for them, to win them as customers. Not all of the bets will work out. But that's OK, because no one failure--no one bet that doesn't pay off--will irreparably harm the country. Our private sector is nimble and can adjust. Indeed, these failures help all entrepreneurs learn and compete for Americans' business. If we get knocked down, we get back up."And so when we assess this race to 5G, we're not just counting metal boxes. We're looking at the robustness of the networks, how consumers use them, the value that is being created, and the broader free market environment that is the oxygen for entrepreneurs to innovate on a 5G network."Our government's approach has been to set the conditions for infrastructure investment and experimentation, and then let the market lead the way. We don't choose a particular band and call it "5G." We offer all of the spectrum bands and let providers craft offerings to leverage the performance of each band. We don't take money from our people so that bureaucrats can decide what infrastructure to spend it on. We require providers to cover their cost of deployment, and then it's up to them to win in the marketplace."So China does have a different system. But I bet on ours. I bet on us and the disruptive innovations to come."Thanks to your efforts, the U.S. had the first commercial 5G builds in the world, we have the best 5G networks in the world, and with the right policies in place we will extend our leadership as these networks continue to be built out."Keep inventing. Keep building. And we in the government will keep at it, too."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6903265 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 27, 2019End of Document

Chinese industry grows to the slower pace since 2002 against U.S. disputesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 16, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 293 wordsBody       China's industrial production grew in August at the lowest pace since 2002, according to official data released on Monday, September 16, following the trend with other economic indicators, at a time when Beijing and Washington Wage a commercial war.                                  The data from the Chinese National Statistics office reveal that industrial production increased 4.4%, compared to the same month last year, after, in July, it climbed 4.8%, also in homologous terms.This is the lowest homologous growth since February 2002, when it rose 2.7%, a trend that has been verifying since the beginning of the year.Industrial production is used by Chinese statistics to measure the activity of large companies, with annual revenues exceeding 20 million yuan (2.5 million euros).The homologous growth of retail sales, the main indicator of private consumption, was 7.5%, after growing 7.6% in July. The Chinese economy grew 6.2%, in the second quarter of this year, the slower pace in nearly three decades, but within the goal set by the Chinese government, and almost twice the world's growth.The rise to the power of Donald Trump in Washington dictates the triggering of trade disputes, with the two countries increasing customs duties over hundreds of millions of dollars of products from each.The U.S. leadership, which fears to lose global industrial dominance as Beijing attempts to transform the country's state-owned firms into important actors in high-value-added sectors, such as artificial intelligence or robotics, accuses China of practices Unfair trade.A brusque devaluation of the Chinese currency, the yuan, last month, seems to have been insufficient to boost the country's exports, which fell 1%, compared to August 2018.       Load-Date: September 17, 2019End of Document

Shaquille O'Neal weighs in on NBA-China spat, says 'Daryl Morey was right'CNN WireOctober 23, 2019 Wednesday 7:26 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 731 wordsByline: By Jessie Yeung, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Basketball icon Shaquille O'Neal has weighed in on the spat between the NBA and China, siding with Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey and his right to support pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.O'Neal, who played for multiple NBA teams before retiring in 2011, spoke on television network TNT Tuesday night as the NBA kicked off the first games of the season."As American people, we do a lot of business in China, and they know and understand our values, and we understand their values," O'Neal said. "And one of our best values here in America is free speech. We're allowed to say what we want to say, and we're allowed to speak up about injustices, and that's just how it goes. And if people don't understand that, that's something they have to deal with."He added that the situation was "unfortunate for both parties," but that "Daryl Morey was right."Morey set off a firestorm in China this month when he posted an image on Twitter that read, "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong." Soon after, the league's Chinese partners suspended ties, state broadcaster CCTV halted all broadcasts of preseason matches, and the Chinese government said the NBA needed to show "mutual respect." Morey apologized and deleted the tweet, but the dispute has continued -- on Tuesday, Chinese state media didn't air the NBA's opening-night games, which it has done in previous years and NBA seasons. O'Neal suggested that he and others would not be silenced by threats of financial repercussions, especially on their social media accounts."Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say that's not right, and that's what he did," O'Neal said. "When it comes to business sometimes, you have to tiptoe around things, but again, they understand our values and we understand our values and here, we have the right to speak. Especially with social media -- we're going to say whatever we want to say, when we want to say it."Hong Kong has been gripped by more than four months of increasingly violent pro-democracy demonstrations, with rising anti-China sentiment among the protesters. China has taken a harsh stance in response, and many brands -- including Nike and South Park -- have been caught in the crossfire. O'Neal is widely considered one of the best players in NBA history, and his comments are all the more striking given his massive popularity in China. While playing for the Miami Heat in 2006, he signed with major Chinese sportswear brand LiNing Company, which released a "Shaq Dunkman" line.Shortly afterward, a towering 50-foot statue of O'Neal was erected in Beijing, at the gate of a city park.The basketball craze in China has only grown since then. China makes up at least 10% of the league's current revenue, according to one analyst, and the country is expected to contribute even more than that over the next decade, perhaps reaching 20% of the league's revenue by 2030.Other beloved NBA players have also spoken out about the dispute -- but not all are in support of Morey. Last week LeBron James, who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, said he was "misinformed.""I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke," James told reporters. "I just think that when you're misinformed or you're not educated about something -- and I'm just talking about the tweet itself -- you never know the ramifications that can happen. We all see what that did -- not only for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well."In a tweet after the interview, James clarified that he meant Morey wasn't educated on the repercussions of the Hong Kong tweet, rather than the situation on the ground. "I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet," he wrote. "I'm not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that."James' comments stoked controversy, with many accusing him of placing the value of Chinese business over the American value of free speech. Some basketball figures, like former NBA player Charles Barkley, defended James. Others like Enes Kanter, who plays for the Boston Celtics, appeared to offer sly criticism. "Wow dude!" Kanter tweeted soon after James' comments. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: October 24, 2019End of Document

How did life expectancy double in China in 70 years?PR NewswireOctober 10, 2019 Thursday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 557 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Oct. 10, 2019 BodyPR NewswireA news report by China.org.cn on China's progress in healthcare: The week-long National Day holiday has just ended in China. In hot scenic spots in your country, you might come across groups of senior and middle-aged tourists coming from China. If you were in China in the past week, you might see many elderly people dancing enthusiastically in parks.However, it may be a big surprise for some of you to know that 70 years ago, the average life expectancy of Chinese people was only 35 years. Luckily, today, the figure has been raised to 77, and the country's major health indices are all better than the average level of middle and high-income countries.To a large extent, this improvement should be attributed to progress in China's healthcare.When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, Chinese farmers had very limited access to doctors and medicine. In the 1960s, the situation was greatly improved, as the authorities encouraged and organized people with basic medical knowledge and nursing skills to go to the countryside. These people worked like other farmers, but acted as doctors at spare time. They were thus nicknamed "barefoot doctors," because farmers in southern China often worked barefoot in rice fields.In the following decades, and especially since the reform and opening-up in 1978, China has seen constant growth in medical services, with a large number of hospitals built nationwide. Yet, China has about 1.4 billion people, but only a comparatively small number of quality hospitals. To address the problem, in recent years, the Chinese government has established a system of tiered diagnosis and treatment. Developing private hospitals has become a major focus of reform to ease people's difficulties in receiving medical services.Through reducing or exempting taxes, streamlining administrative procedures, improving the medical insurance system and other measures, China has boosted the development of private hospitals to meet people's diversified demands in healthcare.By the end of 2018, there were about 21,000 private hospitals, accounting for 63.5% of the country's total. Many of them have expanded to establish a rather complete system of departments. They provide varied medical services, playing an important role in receiving patients with limited access to large public hospitals, and significantly enriching the country's healthcare resources.Compared with many other countries, China started late in systematic healthcare and its medical service is weak in many aspects. However, today, it has become one of the countries making the greatest advances in healthcare. Over the past seven decades, by increasing the accessibility of healthcare resources, establishing the world's largest medical insurance system, building clean cities and carrying out the fitness-for-all campaign, China is making the right to health a basic right for all citizens. Besides a longer life span, Chinese people are also living a happy and decent life today.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmHow did life expectancy double in China in 70 yearshttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2019-10/10/content_75286573.htm View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/how-did-life-expectancy-double-in-china-in-70-years-300936234.htmlSOURCE China.org.cnCONTACT: Ni Jingjing, +86-15811090105, pr@china.org.cnLoad-Date: October 11, 2019End of Document

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, September 4th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.We have breaking news this morning -- the Hong Kong extradition bill has been fully withdrawn. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam making it official moments ago this morning.Amid early reports of the news, that drove stocks higher across the board in Hong Kong, throughout Asia, and Europe and the U.S.Futures are poised for a big rally at the start of trading this morning. Take a look at the numbers. Dow Industrials set to open up about 200 points right out of the gate, three quarters of 1 percent. S&P is up 22 and the Nasdaq is up 77.This after declines across the board yesterday. The Dow falling nearly 300 points on that ISM report that showed factory activity shrank for the first time in three years.Global markets this morning taking a cue from Wall Street and trading up. FT 100 up 20 points, CAC 40 up 54, DAX index up 114 in Germany -- that's almost 1 percent in Germany.It all started in Asia. It was green across the board. Hang Seng soaring on the news out of Hong Kong, up almost 4 percent. Again, that extradition bill now fully withdrawn.That was one of the catalysts that brought the protesters to the streets. They want autonomy. We'll see what happens now with the he protesters.Meanwhile we are tracking Hurricane Dorian this morning. We have new pictures this morning showing the destruction in the Bahamas as the growing storm churns toward Florida right now and the Carolinas. We have the very latest and we're going to take you there to show you.Google may be in legal trouble now, reports say that the technology giant is being looked at by more than half of the nation's attorneys general. Find out why.Then farmers getting creative in their push for a trade deal. The music video you don't want to miss with a mission, pass USMCA.All that coming up this morning.Coming up this morning, joining the conversation: Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is here talking about the anti-trust probe into Google. The CEO of Equinox, Charles Myers joining us on the trade impact. Former chief economic adviser under Bush 43, Ed Lazier (ph) on central banks. Waffle House CEO Walt Ehmer on Hurricane Dorian. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a lot coming up these next two hours.And we kick it off this hour with this breaking news out of Hong Kong. The region's chief executive Carrie Lam withdrew the Chinese extradition bill formally. That bill was really the catalyst that sparked the protests that have taken over the city in recent months and the airport.The bill allowed Hong Kong citizens to be sent to mainland China for trials. The Hang Seng soared on the news, up 4 percent. The others also higher in Asia.Joining me right now is Hudson Institute, senior fellow and director of the Center for Chinese strategy, Michael Pillsbury. Michael -- it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks very much for joining me this morning.MICHAEL PILLSBURY, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE: Thanks -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Your reaction now to this news that she is formally withdrawing this bill.PILLSBURY: It's very good news. She wouldn't do this without permission from Xi Jinping up in Beijing. These other demands the demonstrators have made -- they want a police investigation for brutality, they want some of their comrades released from jail, and the really big demand is universal elections that China promised in 1980 and promised early in 1984 as well.So she hasn't made enough concessions but this is a real breakthrough and frankly, it bodes well for the trade talks because if Xi Jinping approves this kind of concession for Hong Kong, maybe he'll approve the delegation coming here in September and getting back to where the president was in early April with 90 percent of the trade deal done. So this is very big news, I think.BARTIROMO: Are they going to come to the U.S. for another meeting, Michael -- because so far we have no details on any meeting between Xi Jinping and President Trump in September.PILLSBURY: Well, if you read the President's tweets closely from yesterday, he's saying that they're probably going to try to wait him out 16 months and hope for a Democrat to win. That's what the Chinese tell me.The President has told me I'm wrong. This is just wishful thinking on the part of the Chinese. But their analysts seem to believe a Democrat is going to win so they'll get a better deal.BARTIROMO: Interesting. What do you think the deal should look like? I mean at this point the President has outlined the big ticket items. You know, the President issued a stark warning to China vowing to ramp up pressure if he wins a second term. That delaying negotiations until after 2020 election would end in, quote, "much tougher deal".PILLSBURY: Yes.BARTIROMO: And we know that the big ticket items were the theft of IP, the forced transfer of technology. Can the President do a deal without that?PILLSBURY: No. But those aren't the really biggest items. The biggest items are the legal enforcement system, kind of three-layer system that Bob Lighthizer outlined to the Congress a few months ago. That if there's misconduct again after the deal is signed, then there will be a system by which companies who engage in intellectual property theft or government agencies can be punished. And there will be no retaliation from China for that punishment.That's a big part of the deal, make it legally binding. Frankly that's the problem in Hong Kong -- Maria. The British thought they had a treaty with China back in 1984. The Chinese under Obama announced no, this treaty no longer is in effect. It's just a historical document. And nobody called them on it.So if that's the kind of thing happens with the trade talks, it means we'll have a piece of paper that cannot be enforced and President Trump will come under enormous criticism from both the right and the left.So what I've been talking about myself, is the idea of escalation. Maybe we need to do more that will really get the attention of the Chinese. They're not feeling the pain yet. This is something that's objective versus subjective. Objectively, you and your guests can all talk about oh, my god, you know, China's feeling such pain, look at these indices.But from what I hear from the Chinese, this is nothing to them --BARTIROMO: Yes.PILLSBURY: -- and they're talking now about a long march, getting ready for a 100-year marathon.BARTIROMO: That's right.PILLSBURY: -- you know, they're not feeling any pain. But there are things we can do, there are things that President can do that will really make them feel pain.BARTIROMO: And this is the 70th anniversary of communist China coming up - -PILLSBURY: October 1st, es.BARTIROMO: Yes. In October -- October 1.Look, there's Huawei pain, right. I mean the Chinese technology giant Huawei has felt the pain of the ban. Now it's accusing the U.S. of committing cyber attacks and coercing employees to gather information on the company.So when you look at the Huawei situation, that has been a real tit-for-tat and people feel that that ban, that list -- the blacklist was actually very impactful.PILLSBURY: The President's on the right track obviously with Huawei and the blacklist or the entity list. However, Huawei is one of a hundred giant Chinese companies that engage in the same kind of wrongdoing. To get after all hundred of them, there's a way to do that.Many of them are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and they have a waiver from the SEC that goes back many years. They don't have to undergo auditing. China says our large companies internal affairs are state secrets, we're not going to let you audit them.This is really shocking for the average investors that so many Chinese companies are on Wall Street without being audited. A stroke of the pen and that waiver will be ended. Then all these companies have to be audited. There will obviously be trouble found in their books. You're talking about a rather large slide in stock market listing prices for China. This is one of many things that could be done.There's a set of escalatory steps the President could take. The Chinese are betting he will not do this.BARTIROMO: This is a really important point that you're making. Because if the President takes that extra step to try to look at -- you know, zero in on those companies that actually trade in the United States or even put any limit on the listings -- Chinese companies going public in the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, that would be a big hit to China.PILLSBURY: They've got to meet the same accounting standards as all the other companies on the stock exchange..BARTIROMO: And by the way, you would expect that you're a public company, you have to meet the accounting standards.PILLSBURY: Well, some of these companies, I think 11 or 12 of them, are state-owned enterprises. The very so-called national champions that have been doing the technology theft.BARTIROMO: That's unbelievable.And by the way, Huawei, isn't Huawei originally Nortel networks. I mean -- The crux of their business is from Nortel.PILLSBURY: Right. Well, they're technology thieves from way back. They've also had help from the government, to getting their market share.They're the number one telecommunications company in the world. The reason for that is how m we've helped them.BARTIROMO: So I mean my take-away in all of this is that Beijing keeps breaking its promises, right. I mean they broke their promise to Hong Kong. They broke their promises in the WTO. Why wouldn't they break their promises to the United States and you're saying yes, that's why they reneged because they wouldn't agree to the enforcement that the U.S. wanted to put in place.PILLSBURY: Yes. It's not official -- Maria. But there were three White House sources who told Reuters that the Chinese reneging was removing the parts of the 150=page agreement that had to do with legally binding enforcement. That's the crux of the matter.BARTIROMO: Yes. Unbelievable. So you think this is --PILLSBURY: By the way, you know the Chinese deny everything. They deny technology theft --BARTIROMO: They won't even admit it. Right, they won't even admit.So real quick before you go -- Michael. The extradition bill formally withdrawn, you think it's good news. What else should we look at in terms of the next catalyst here.NAPOLITANO: The next catalyst is the delegation coming or not coming with in a couple of weeks to Washington for round 13 and then what they bring with them. If they say ok, we'll let some of the legally binding language go back in, that's really big news.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Michael -- it's great to have your insights --(CROSSTALKING)PILLSBURY: The other big news is whether escalation is needed or not. That's the other big news.BARTIROMO: Escalation.The President has a range of options he can choose from. He could raise the tariffs higher. Tariffs can go to 50 percent or even 100 percent.BARTIROMO: Yes. but that's going to impact the U.S. economy, right. I mean just does he want to have --PILLSBURY: You're telling me. But don't forget the President's point. This should have been done 30 years ago.BARTIROMO: Yes. Michael -- it's great to get your insights as always. Thank you so much, sir.PILLSBURY: Thanks -- Maria.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon. Michael Pillsbury there.Meanwhile there's this. Hurricane Dorian still bearing down on the United States after causing major devastation in the Bahamas, at least seven people have been killed. Evacuations are underway for millions of residents in the path of the storm along the southeast border.Ellison barber is in Fort Piers, Florida right now. Ellison son.ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey Maria -- yes. So Hurricane Dorian is expected to move along the coast of Georgia and South Carolina and then possibly make landfall in north Carolina on Thursday. The acting FEMA administrator said late yesterday that at this point it seems like the impacts of Dorian in Florida will be minimal.From what we've seen, that has been the case. We're sort of following the tale of the hurricane. We're getting the very end, the last little bit of the outer bands as they pass through this area and Dorian continues to move up north.It seems this area where we are now, this marina, seems like they did experience some flooding. If you look a little in front of me, you can see some of the debris that's over here. If you follow a little further back and look up and it's probably hard to hear, but we can hear the loudest sound that we can hear down here right now is when the wind comes through. The flapping of that sail that that has gotten loose there.On the whole though, The Rain has let up. It was mild this morning. The wind has remained mild here as well. There are still evacuation orders in place in some counties. Seven counties - this one where we are right now, Saint Lucy's County, their evacuation orderlies lifted at 6:00 6:00.So for now conditions in Florida seem to be improving but officials are warning anybody north of here to stay attentive, not let their guard down because this storm is still making its way up north -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Ellison -- thank you. Ellison Barber this morning in Florida.Coming up, Google's under fire -- more than half of state attorneys general reportedly taking a closer look at the technology giant's potential anti- trust violations.

The company has named John Stankey president and chief operating officer making him the likely successor to chief executive Randall Stephenson. Stankey who is currently the head of Warner Media will continue in that role as he assumes his new responsibilities next month. Stankey will report to Stephenson.Let's take a look at shares of AT&T -- up 11-cents right here in the premarket.Facebook making a significant policy change. It is turning off all facial recognition, making users choose to opt-in if they want to use it. And if you already have the feature turned on, you're going to receive a notice telling you how to turn it off.So this means that facial recognition won't be used by default to recognize someone's face in photos or videos or to suggest them and their friends and how they tag us. The change comes as Facebook remains under pressure to better protect user privacy -- Maria.So I like that. It's the way Europe does it. You opt in if you want this technology. But I don't like my features and my face, my finger prints being out there without my permission.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Nobody does. And there's a lot of debate about facial recognition. For sure.Lauren -- thank you.SIMONETTI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Coming up big tech in legal jeopardy, more than 30 states are targeting Google in an anti-trust probe. Judge Andrew Napolitano is here to weigh in on that.And then rev up your engines -- Lamborghini unveiling its first hybrid car. How fast it goes, next up.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Big tech in legal jeopardy once again. Google reportedly the target of a multistate anti-trust investigation, led by more than 30 state attorneys general. They are arguing that Google, among other technology companies, have so much user data that competition from newcomers is almost impossible.Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge -- it is good to see you.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.So this should not be a surprise, when the anti-trust division of the Justice Department, the federal government, announces that they're commencing an investigation, sometimes they announce the investigation by filing a complaint, sometimes the investigation takes years because there's so much information they have to gather from the entities they're investigating.It is not surprising for the state attorneys general to do the same thing. The feds are looking to correct what they believe are monopolistic practices, either a contractor combination and restraint of interstate trade or practices intended to prevent any competition from entering the marketplace.The state attorneys general always and only want one thing. Can you guess what that is? Cash. They want to shake down Google to get these investigations to go away, so they can supplement their state treasuries. That's all they're looking for.The state anti-trust statutes mimic almost word for word the federal anti- trust.BARTIROMO: Yes. But Judge -- I mean Google has 90 percent market share in search, right?NAPOLITANO: The question is, did they obtain that 90 percent by any illegal means or do we all use Google because we all love it or do we all use Google because there's nothing else to use.BARTIROMO: And it was first. It was first so it had that, you know, runway to gain all that data.NAPOLITANO: So the essence of the anti-trust investigation cannot be the search engine because there's no charge for using it. The essence would have to be something to do with how they earn their income, which is advertising.What do they do to advertise? Are they forcing advertisers to take more advertising than they want to? It's call a tying arrangement, I only want to buy one package, they're going to make me buy 12.So it's fact-sensitive. I don't think the DOJ knows where this is going to lead yet. The DOJ has done the right thing by commencing an investigation, getting documents from Google, looking at the documents and seeing if there's monopolistic -- if there's evidence of monopoly activity.BARTIROMO: Yes. I'm wondering -- I've been working on a piece, looking at the fact that Google walks away from the Pentagon, that Project Maven --NAPOLITANO: Right.BARTIROMO: And yet it has an AI lab in China. I'm wondering what that means in terms of China trying to use Google to spy on the United States or, you know, get a better trade deal. I mean, I just wonder how China is using Google since Google walked away from the Pentagon.NAPOLITANO: As you know, during the break we were talking about this, and the great Andy said not only does China have all this information, who smoked two packs of cigarettes last week on their own people, they're gathering that on us.How do gather they gather it on us -- by their inveigling their way into American technology. But isn't it bizarre that Google and Silicon Valley would dump the Pentagon and pick up a contract for the Chinese government?When the President complains about that, that's a legitimate complaint.BARTIROMO: It's legitimate because in China there's something called civil-military fusion -- any technology that goes to China first will go to the military.NAPOLITANO: Right. No surprise.BARTIROMO: It's not like you can just go work on commercial things in China. No, if it's working for the military, that's where it will be used.NAPOLITANO: So when will this --BARTIROMO: So where does this go?NAPOLITANO: I was just going to say, when will the investigations by the 30 states attorneys general go away just the way they, when the same 30 states more or less attorneys general investigated big tobacco. Big tobacco coughed up enough money to get the investigation go away, that's when this will go away.Now, Google is wealthier than big tobacco. So I don't know if this is going to be settled quickly or in the long run.BARTIROMO: It feels a little like back in the 80s or 90s when Microsoft was the target because it got so big, right.NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: I mean --JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, if you run a big company, you run deal with this all the time. I can't tell you how many suits you get for harassment or various things by this cottage industry of lawyers. If you settle for less than legal fees because you want to get up. This is the same thing with the state -- at the federal level, there's a legitimate investigation.NAPOLITANO: Agreed.FREEMAN: At the state level, they just want the money. They'll settle for whatever amount of money they can get from these companies.NAPOLITANO: So it's all -- Google cannot conspire with other big tech to agree on a price of anything. But the 30 states attorneys general can conspire with each other and agree on how much they want to take from Google.BARTIROMO: That's very interesting.Let me switch gears and ask you about this the Ariana Grande story. Pop star Ariana Grande --NAPOLITANO: This is a field I know a lot about.BARTIROMO: She's suing the retailer Forever 21 and singer claims that the brand posted misleading photos, using a model who looks just like her and seemingly copied imagery from her Seven Rings music video. So these are -- there's Ariana Grande on the right.NAPOLITANO: Right. So if this case is not settled, a jury in Los Angeles will be looking at the same pictures we're now looking at and saying aren't they confusingly similar.So the law is that Forever 21 or anybody can't just take Ariana Grande's image and duplicate it or merely duplicate it in order to sell something without getting a licensing fee from her. She's a very legitimate argument.The question is are they confusingly similar. Now I'm not an Ariana Grande fan and I've never shopped at Forever 21 but they look confusingly similar to me.BARTIROMO: Well, they also have the same hair piece on. So there you go. I mean they actually put this almost the same outfit on.NAPOLITANO: Talking about a lot of money. I mean Ariana Grande is huge. According to this complaint, one Instagram mentioning one product sells over $100,000 of that product in the next five minutes.BARTIROMO: Wow. Oh, my god.NAPOLITANO: Varney wishes he could move a market like that.BARTIROMO: They call her an influencer. Judge -- great stuff.Thank you so much.NAPOLITANO: Pleasure.BARTIROMO: Judge Andrew Napolitano there. Coming up, eye on Dorian, storm surge warnings in effect from Florida to North Carolina this morning. Where will it make landfall? We are going to take a look when we come back.And then trade tensions weigh on consumers -- we're taking a look at that and the impact on manufacturers with American apparel and foot ware associate CEO next. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, September 4th. Your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are rallying this morning, take a look at Futures indicating a 200 point move at the start of trading. S&P Futures up 23, the NASDAQ Futures up 73, about one percent higher.It follows declines across the board yesterday, the Dow falling nearly 300 points as a decline in manufacturing activity spooked investors. The Dow was down 285 yesterday, the S&P was down 20 and the NASDAQ down 88.But today we have breaking news out of Hong Kong and that is lifting many boats across the world. The U.S. of course you just saw Futures indicating a rally. European indices are higher across the board as well.

We're taking a look at the company's most powerful super car later this hour.All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning but first, our top story this half an hour, hurricane Dorian bearing down on the U.S. Evacuations are now underway for many residents in the path of the storm.Joining us right now on the telephone is former U.S. Army special operations and strategic advisor at WhiteFox Defense, Brett Velicovich. Brett, you actually evacuated your home, you took the directives. Where are you now?BRETT VELICOVICH, STRATEGIC ADVISOR, WHITEFOX DEFENSE (via telephone): Hi, Maria. Thanks for having me. So yes, we're safely located in the mountains of North Carolina right now. We're outside of Asheville and we evacuated. So I live in Savannah, Georgia typically and we evacuated basically after the governor has issued the mandatory evacuation order when our county was on the list Monday. And you know, we -- they basically had done that for counties that were east of I-95 in Georgia and really, you know, we -- and we were told to get out, we went around, kind of got the last minute supplies.I was pretty surprised of actually how many people stayed. I think there's a lot of residents that have gone through hurricanes before but I just remember being a part of an emergency response team for hurricane Harvey in helping people who had essentially lost everything and almost every one of them said the same thing, we thought it was OK, we thought it wasn't going to be bad.And so we made it a point to get out of there. Highways were pretty packed almost immediately, they started blocking all traffic moving east out of I- 26 and opened up basically the other side of the freeway so every -- pushing all the traffic to the west of the state now.And really I think the biggest concern is just the storm surge that's coming up. There's a curfew in place in Savannah, Georgia. Bridges are all closed. Police are basically saying anyone out of the hours of 09:00 p.m. and 06:00 p.m. during the curfew could be arrested. So it's tough to get out now, but yes, we're doing fine. You know, we're glad we were able to get out of there. I'm mostly concerned about folks that didn't have the capability to get out as well. So --BARTIROMO: All right, well, we'll be watching. You're not -- you're not nervous about North Carolina, obviously. You went to the mountains there. So you've gone way back from the shore.What did -- what did the activity feel like when you were leaving Georgia where -- I mean, did it feel like a state of emergency?VELICOVICH: Yes, I think so. It did for the most part. Again, except for a lot of folks were trying to seam to ride it out. But the highways, I mean, almost immediately when the mandatory evacuation notice was issued we got, you know, text messages and notification --BARTIROMO: Right.VELICOVICH: -- over the radio to get out. And highways were packed. You know, it was -- it took us twice long to get to our location as we thought it would be.BARTIROMO: Yes, sure.VELICOVICH: And you know, Dorian -- the problem particularly with Savannah, Georgia, it's a very low-lying coastal area. So even four inches of rain before from storms they've had -- they've had flooding. And so they're really, really concerned that the storm surge is going to push, you know, a lot of flooding into the city even despite the fact that it looks like the hurricane is reducing in strength and so --BARTIROMO: Yes, well, Andy, you made the point earlier that just because it's down to a Category two doesn't mean that it's not going to be incredible gust of wind and major --VELICOVICH: Exactly.BARTIROMO: That's what you said about Sandy, right?ANDY PUZDER, AUTHOR, THE CAPITALIST COMEBACK: Yes, they were saying this morning, I saw Janice Dean on Fox, she was saying that Sandy was a Category one so people out there in the northeast should be able to relate to the fact that that can be a terrific storm. So category, you shouldn't feel comfortable just because it's a Category two. Get out of town.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.VELICOVICH: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Brett, it's great to have you. Thanks so much for sharing your story with us this morning.VELICOVICH: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Brett Velicovich joining us there on the phone.We want to turn to trade and tariffs this morning. The latest round of tariffs going into effect this week, September 1. That affected areas including coffee, tea, appliances, televisions, among other goods coming from China into the United States. This coming as the Swiss Bank UBS is predicting that this latest trade dispute could lead to a recession in the coming years.Joining us right now is American Apparel and Footwear Association president and CEO Rick Helfenbein. And Rick, it's great to have you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.RICK HELFENBEIN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, AMERICAN APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR ASSOCIATION: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to this trade fight. What are you hearing from CEOs and managers of businesses in your industry?HELFENBEIN: You know, quite frankly, Maria, I would like to hear a little less from our CEOs. The phone is -- the phone is ringing off the hook. They have real concerns because irregardless of who says who pays for the tariffs, it seems the U.S. Customs has a direct line to their checking accounts. Working capital is shrinking. That's a concern for business. We have some CEOs talking to me about, you know, isn't it great that the interest rate is low because now they have to borrow money to pay taxes.BARTIROMO: Wow.HELFENBEIN: And you know, it's a concern. Traditionally, the retail industry, you know, I don't want to use the r word but we're the -- we're the first one to be called into it and we're usually the first ones to get out of it. And we're not seeing it yet. But this could cause a contraction.This -- we call it the Cinderella tax which hit us at midnight on Saturday night when our clothes suddenly turned to rags. Cinderella tax is a real (AUDIO GAP) thing for us because we make our money in fourth quarter of the year. We've been struggling all year. And now someone tells you, oh, we're going to take 15 percent right out of your pockets. It's a problem. It's a real problem.We've been talking to the administration at length. We have asked them repeatedly, please stay away from the consumer. And for a long time they've been listening, but suddenly in this last round they've come after the consumer and we worry.I mean, we worry for us because we don't have choices in where to go. 41 percent of all apparel comes from China. You could argue that all day long and say bring it back to America. We would, if we could. 69 percent of all footwear comes from China. 84 percent of accessories including hats and handbags comes from China.BARTIROMO: Wow.HELFENBEIN: We don't have a place to go. We're trying to move out if the president's telling us to move out, so be it, we'll move. But it'll take three to five years. We can't do it. So we're going to have to stay there and eat the 15 percent and that's going to get passed on to the American consumer and we say watch out.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Let me ask you a question about that, a lot of people worry the way you do that the consumer's going to pull back especially during the holiday season and that's why the president himself delayed some of those tariffs. But there are others who will say, you know, consumers are more resilient than you think. They actually understand what's at stake here and they're willing to pay slightly more for these goods because they understand it's a longer term game. What's your argument to that?HELFENBEIN: Well, it's sort of in our industry, we look at three things. We look at the unemployment which right now we have low unemployment.BARTIROMO: 51-year low.HELFENBEIN: Yes, it's fabulous. We look at consumer confidence, flat but holding at a good level. And then we look at the price of gasoline. Price of gasoline goes up, the amount people pay for goods goes down.So we're worried that longer term they have less money in their pockets. They will buy less. It's a pretty simple formula in our industry. As prices go up, sales go down, jobs get lost.BARTIROMO: So what do you make of the strength on the consumer? Nancy, you were just telling us the consumer -- the U.S. consumer, 17 percent of the global activity. How come they haven't -- how come they still -- right? I mean --NANCY TENGLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, TENGLER WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Yes, I think I'm wondering if in fact you're seeing a slowdown or you're just worried that it will come.HELFENBEIN: We're worried. You know, and I --BARTIROMO: Or it hasn't come yet?HELFENBEIN: Hasn't come yet. But we always think six to nine months in advance. So we see a slowdown in buying. You saw a slowdown in domestic manufacturing yesterday. We worry in front of us.TENGLER: But you've got low interest rates, you have low gas prices, so that's good news going into the fourth quarter.HELFENBEIN: That's good, all the signs are good. We wish the president would hold back for the holiday season. We wish that we'd spent more time at the negotiating table.BARTIROMO: Andy, this is real important because the president is a business president, first business president. He needs the economy to stay strong going in 2020 if he wants to win re-election. This is not good timing for all of that.PUZDER: No, it's not but look, the president is -- and Rick, I know Rick is generally supportive of what the president is trying to do. But the president's trying to fight the good fight. This is a fight that should have been fought 30 years ago.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.PUZDER: And if we're ever going to fight it, we should fight it while the consumer is strong. And with wages up, the number of people working up, taxes down, so they're taking home more of what they earn. If we're ever going to fight this fight, now's the time to fight it.And what's the alternative? The alternative, just to let China run rampant over the United States. We can't do that. So I appreciate what Rick's facing and I'm glad I'm not facing the same problems and I know you've tried to move some supply chain out of China. There's the garment industry has moved in a big way to Vietnam as I recall.HELFENBEIN: That is correct.BRENBERG: But you can't -- but there isn't enough room there, there's not enough capacity. It's going to take some time. So, this -- it's a problem. We need economic growth for this next election. But when do you want to them to -- when do you want to fight this fight?BARTIROMO: You know, it's a good -- it's a really good point that you -- that you mentioned. And I wonder, Rick, how many of your companies, footwear, apparel companies, have the same exact apparel and footwear in China with a very similar name but a little different -- a little different look in the logo that China just stole from you?HELFENBEIN: Oh, we have that and we've actually been fighting that in the courts in China with some success. We call them parasite brands. It's ugly. But we've actually had some decent luck with the Chinese in fighting. The Chinese would like counterfeits to go away.You know, we look at it as market, we want to sell into China. That's one thing that the president has said, market access. But you know, if you want to sell, then why are you telling us to get out? It's sort of a conundrum for us. We'd very much like to sell into China.BARTIROMO: Well, I think -- I think many people would like to but I think for many years American businesses were so interested in getting a piece of that 1.4 billion person population, they forgot to protect their own products.HELFENBEIN: That's true.BARTIROMO: So here we are in this fight. We'll see. Will you come back and give us an update please?HELFENBEIN: Please.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Rick, great to have you this morning.

The stock is up nearly 60 percent so far this year, it's had an incredible run.Joining us right now is the CEO of Equinix, he's Charles Meyers. Charles, it's great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us.CHARLES MEYERS, CEO, EQUINIX: Good morning. It's great to be here.BARTIROMO: So you've actually been an incredible recipient of this good news of all of this data that has been gathered and exploded over the last several years. Characterize your business.MEYERS: Yes, we have indeed. We're helping our customers really think through their digital transformation agenda which is, you know, board level priority for a lot of our customers.And so, we happen to have the opportunity in the house to some of the most important digital infrastructure in the world inside of our 200 data centers around the world. 10 million square feet of data center space around the world that we're housing some of the most important digital infrastructure out there.BARTIROMO: And how tough is the transition for a traditional business to see the Amazons of the world come in and take market share and force that company to transition to digital?MEYERS: Yes, that's what I said. You know, we see it as consumers, right. Digital is changing our lives, how we work, how we live, how we eat, how we sleep, everything. But it's also changing the basis of competition in virtually every, you know, sector around the world and so the companies that are responding well to digital are thriving. And the ones who aren't are struggling.BARTIROMO: Yes.TENGLER: So we were talking just briefly about the cloud and you know, certainly everyone thinks that Microsoft and Amazon own the cloud space. Talk to us a little about how you're benefiting as well.MEYERS: Yes, we -- you know, the cloud is a major driver, underlying driver for our business. And so what we're finding is is the customers are really cloud first in their mentality in terms of how they're thinking about their digital infrastructure now.So it used to be that they would own and operate and manage those stuffs, build their own data centers. You know, all of those. They're really now thinking we want to be more asset-light. We still have critical infrastructure that we need to manage for security performance, compliance reasons, etcetera.But you know, we want to push to the cloud when we can and when they're looking to interconnect to the cloud, they're really doing that at Equinix. We have about 40 percent of the private onramps so the cloud live inside of Equinix facilities around the world. So it's a major driver for our business. And we're -- you know, big partners and all of the cloud providers are major customers of ours.TENGLER: And so then with the 30 year now at 1.9, tell us about your dividend growth for investors that are searching for yields.MEYERS: Yes you know, an incredible story for us I think has been people saying we love the dividend yield, we're at about 1.8 percent today with the -- you know, the 10-year at 1-1/2 and we're -- yet, where at the same time they can get that healthy dividend yield which we believe will continue to grow based on the strength of our business and they can play the growth story of really the digital economy at the same time.TENGLER: Awesome.BARTIROMO: Where does the growth come from now? Look out the next five years for Equinix.MEYERS: Well, I think there's a number of dimensions to that. There's a geographic dimension. We're seeing really strength in Asia as well as in Europe, about 55 percent of our business is outside the U.S. now. We're a very global business.But it's being -- also being driven by these underlying secular trends, whether that's artificial intelligence, IoT, 5G, big data of various sorts. I think those are really underlying trends that are just fueling data and the -- and the digital economy for customers.BARTIROMO: So has the China dispute affected your businesses in any way given the global nature of it?MEYERS: Not a -- not as much. I mean, (INAUDIBLE) we are not directly impacted by tariffs because there's not much of our cost of goods that is tariffed. But I think it impacts sentiment and it impacts how people are thinking about their business. But it's really interesting and that some of the sectors that you would think are most sensitive to tariffs, retail, manufacturing, actually are some of our strongest sectors right now because they have the strongest digital transformation priority.TENGLER: I have some follow-up, I'm sorry, if it's all right. So we heard from Cisco's CEO that he was just not being invited to the business. So it wasn't the tariffs but it was that local sentiment which you just alluded to. Has that impacted you at all?MEYERS: Well, I do think that you know, it's interesting because we talk about trade and what has happened, and I do think physical trade, you know, has reduced in terms of cross-border trade for a variety of reasons, localization of thinking, etcetera.But digital trade is really fueling the economy and so I think that, you know, what we're seeing is that's still a huge priority for people in really driving their business, so they're making investments.BARTIROMO: There was -- there was a moment in time during the dot-com boom back in the 90s when companies were saying, oh, I've got to get in here -- I got to get in here. Are you seeing that kind of scramble now with A.I. that companies need to put A.I. in their businesses or get left behind?MEYERS: Yes, although I think it has a lot more meat to it than it did in terms of a -- you know, sort of that initial dot-com sort of boom. Because I think this is more about fundamentals in terms of people saying understanding our customers, understanding their buying behavior and responding to it.BARTIROMO: Charles, thank you. Great to see you.MEYERS: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Charles Meyers there, Equinix. We'll be right back.Load-Date: September 4, 2019End of Document

Taylor Swift to Perform in China at Alibaba's Annual Shopping GalaBillboardOctober 28, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 475 wordsByline: Patrick BrzeskiHighlight: Taylor Swift is heading to China to perform at Alibaba Group's annual Singles' Day shopping extravaganza next month.Body Taylor Swift is heading to China to perform at Alibaba Group's annual Singles' Day shopping extravaganza next month.The pop star will perform at Shanghai's Mercedes-Benz Arena on the evening of Nov. 10, along with a lineup of prominent stars and personalities from China and other parts of Asia. Among the acts slated to shill online shopping for Alibaba are Chinese singer-songwriter and actress G.E.M., local pop star Hua Chenyu, Japanese singer Kana Hanazawa and over a dozen others.More than a few U.S. sports and entertainment figures — including Scarlett Johansson, David Beckham, Mariah Carey and Daniel Craig — have flocked to the Alibaba-produced spectacle in years past to build their brands among Chinese consumers. But in recent months, U.S. celebrities' eagerness to please the Chinese government and the country's enormous consumer base have begun to be viewed with more skepticism by the U.S. public. After Beijing's recent heavy-handed attempts to squash free speech beyond its borders — such as the  NBA's serious travails  over a general manager's single tweet of support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, and the             erasure of South Park  from the Chinese Internet because of a satirical episode — many U.S. politicians have             questioned  whether the Beijing regime's global political messaging should be so readily accommodated given its various ongoing human rights abuses. Singles' Day was invented in the 1990s as an alternate to Valentine's Day, since the date on which it is held, 11/11, appears graphically as the loneliest of calendar numbers. In 2009, Alibaba struck on the ingenious marketing ploy of encouraging Chinese consumers to purchase themselves a treat, or several, on Singles' Day (in that sense, it's arguably the most selfish of holidays, too). Alibaba's first Singles' Day promotion, designed to drum up sales for the company's upstart Tmall service (Amazon with Chinese characteristics), scored $7.7 million in revenue.Alibaba's Singles' Day Gala Show, held each year on Nov. 10 and broadcast live across China, has since grown into a hybrid spectacle combining elements of a pop concert with a variety show, the New Year's Eve countdown and the Home Shopping Network. The show features appearances, skits and performances involving local and international celebs — past participants have included Kobe Bryant, Kevin Spacey, Nicole Kidman and others — and builds up to midnight, when Alibaba launches cut-rate sales across its various e-commerce services, encouraging viewers at home to buy, buy, buy.In recent years, the shopping extravaganza has generated more revenue than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. Last year's event, resulted in $30 billion in sales over Alibaba's platforms in just 24 hours. This article originally appeared on The Hollywood Reporter .Link to ImageLoad-Date: October 28, 2019End of Document

PORTMAN TALKS TRADE: HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF PASSING USMCA AND CREATING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH CHINAStates News ServiceOctober 28, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 948 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:In a new interview with Brookings Institution's David Dollar on his "Dollar and Sense" podcast, Senator Portman discussed the importance of passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement this year and U.S. trade relations with China and the ongoing negotiations between the two countries. Portman, who delivered remarks on the Senate floor highlighting the economic benefits of USMCA last week, highlighted how USMCA will modernize the current trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.An excerpt of the podcast can be found below and the full podcast is available here:Question: So let's talk about the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico the new NAFTA. It's been negotiated. It's called the U.S.MexicoCanada Agreement or USMCA. So how is USMCA different from the existing NAFTA?Portman : Well, it's better. You know, one, it's just an update. So every 25 years or so it's good to update your trade agreements and this one is 25 years old. As one example, there's nothing in [NAFTA] on digital trade, which is incredibly important for us right now. We have a comparative advantage there. We're a country that does a lot of digital trade, particularly with our neighbors. So, to have a rule, for instance, in place which is in the new one that says there cannot be tariffs on data, or you can't require localization of data, in other words, requiring that there be a physical presence in that country. Those are really important to us. And one reason that the International Trade Commission has said that this will create 176,000 new jobs is because of that because there's a lot more certainty connected now on the data side. But it's beyond that. I mean, for years and years people have expressed concern that there are not labor standards that are enforceable, as an example. And that would be a classic leveling the playing field issue where in other countries like Mexico if labor standards are not up to the International Labor Organization standards and ours are then that gives them an advantage of having lower wages. We don't want to go down to their wages, we just want them to start moving up toward ours. And that's what this agreement does. In fact, it not just makes it enforceable, it establishes a first time ever minimum wage for a substantial part of the auto production $16 an hour on average which is something you would expect maybe for a Democratic administration to negotiate, but this administration did. And I support it, but it's unusual for a trade agreement. But it also has a requirement of 70 percent of the steel in these automobiles have to be of North American origin. And that's very important for us. And that's one reason, again, the ITC and their study says that we're going to create 20,000-30,000 new auto jobs here in America because it will encourage more jobs to stay here in the United States rather than go to Canada or Mexico.Question : Let's turn to China. As you said, it's your third biggest trading partner. Pretty distant third after Canada and Mexico, but an important trading partner for Ohio. And you already alluded to the issue of a level playing field. I know you know these issues well, so if you could go in a little bit more detail: From the point of view of Ohio, what are the two or three specific things that really bother you about China and that you would like to see addressed?Portman: First is the trade imbalance. If we sent China around $150 billion worth of stuff and they send us something like $550-600 billion. So that imbalance is not sustainable over time and it's the biggest trade deficit of any country in the history of the world. Maybe that's obvious. And they don't have these kinds of huge deficits with the rest of the world. They have surpluses with some countries, but with many countries they have a more balanced trading relationship. So, first is just looking for more balance. And then I think getting into the structural issues which explain much of the imbalance. And their two big ones that affect Ohio a lot. One I would say is subsidization, generally. Whether it's state owned enterprises or whether it's subsidies for certain favored industries that can be energy, it can be labor, it can be all sorts or sorts of direct government subsidies to the cost of the final product. This is why we continually win cases called anti-dumping cases when China sells things that are below their costs it's called dumping. So we're looking for some way to say to China, hey, live by the rules. Not our rules, but the international rules that say that you're not supposed to subsidize stuff. You're supposed to allow things to be able to compete on a more level playing field...And then the final one is this notion of tech transfers. People call it intellectual property sometimes but really I think for most Americans they understand it as we work hard to develop our technology here, we protect it with patents and so on, and then often the Chinese take those ideas...that technology...and use it and use it against us in the sense that U.S. companies then have to compete sometimes with their own technology coming back that that doesn't go through the long RandD process. So they do it in a number of ways. They have licensing agreements where they take technology from American companies that want to do business in China which is a big market. But they also have joint venture requirements for a lot of industries not all, but a lot typically most of the industries that are important to us technologically. So the Chinese government will require that a Chinese company have a 51 percent share minimum in an investment in China.Load-Date: October 29, 2019End of Document

Trump's top trade adviser is mocking China after it called him out for making up a fake expert to bash its economyBusiness Insider USOctober 23, 2019 Wednesday 06:41 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 889 wordsByline: ama@businessinsider.com,  (Alexandra Ma)Highlight: Peter Navarro invented a fake expert named "Ron Vara" and cited him sharing exaggerated threats about China's economy in his books.BodySergei Chirikov/AP; Andrew Harnik/AP• Peter Navarro, the US lead trade negotiator with China, was recently found to have published multiple books citing a fake expert that turned out to be his alter ego.• Navarro had quoted "Ron Vara" (an anagram of his name) sharing exaggerated threats that China poses to the US. He later defended it as a "whimsical device."• China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday slammed Navarro's "lies," and said he has "threaten[ed] and undermine[d] normal international relations and order."• Navarro mocked China in responses, telling CNN: "A source close to Ron Vara indicates China has revoked his visa and lowered his social credit score."• He also joked that China "has banned all anagrams and humor in social media and non-fiction books."• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.President Donald Trump's top trade adviser mocked the Chinese government after it criticized him for inventing a fake expert to bash China in his books.Peter Navarro was found earlier this month to have cited a supposed Harvard-educated investor and China hawk named "Ron Vara" in his publications. Ron Vara turned out to be a nonexistent person, an anagram of Navarro's name."Vara" is cited in many of Navarro's books on economics, and has been quoted giving an extreme picture of the threat that China poses to the world economy.Australian National University academic Tessa Morris-Suzuki first discovered that Vara didn't exist when she tried to verify whether he attended Harvard or existed anywhere outside Navarro's books.Read more: Trump's top trade advisor Peter Navarro's books frequently cite a made-up scholar named 'Ron Vara' who appears to be his alter egoGoogleNavarro has since admitted to inventing Vara, but claimed that the name is a "whimsical device and pen name" that didn't serve as a factual source for his work.The Washington Post pointed out on Tuesday that Navarro uses multiple fictional characters in his books, but never explicitly said that Vara was not real.China on Tuesday slammed Navarro's "lies" about the fake expert, saying that they "will threaten and undermine normal international relations and order."Navarro has been leading US efforts to negotiate a trade deal with China, which has still not come after months of deadlock and tariffs imposed on billions of dollars' worth of US and Chinese goods. He has consistently supported  raising tariffs on China.The US and China struck a partial trade pact last week - but China has said that the            US needs to lift tariffs before they can strike a fuller trade deal.           Read all of Business Insider's coverage of the US-China trade war here.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesHua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, told reporters: "Frankly, this case triggered strong responses and astonishment worldwide. On some level, it shows that out of personal or political hidden intentions, certain people in the US can do whatever they can think of to contain and smear China without scruple."In his 2011 book "Death by China," Navarro had cited Vara as saying "only the Chinese can turn a leather sofa into an acid bath, a baby crib into a lethal weapon, and a cellphone battery into heart-piercing shrapnel."Hua said: "It is absurd and extremely dangerous to make lies, spread lies and even formulate policies based on lies.""Such moves will threaten and undermine normal international relations and order. Apart from that, the US will hurt its own interests in the end," she said.Associated PressNavarro appeared unfazed by China's comments, and issued a statement mocking the China.He told CNN: "A source close to Ron Vara indicates China has revoked his visa and lowered his social credit score. In a related event, the Ministry of State Security has banned all anagrams and humor in social media and non-fiction books."His comments refer to China's controversial social credit system, which attempts to            reward or punish citizens according to their behavior, and the country's strict censorship of what it deems offensive content.The White House and the US embassies in Washington and London have not yet responded to Business Insider's request for comment on Navarro's remarks.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe spokeswoman went on to accuse the US of lying "to fuel the wars in Iraq and Syria" and to criticize China over its actions in the oppressed region of Xinjiang, its response to the            Hong Kong protests, the dangers of            China-made 5G technology, and the country's            Belt and Road Initiative.Beijing has long told foreign countries to stay out of national issues."We hope the international community including you, my journalist friends, will learn something from this case and carefully examine the ideas and views that certain people in the US are so desperately disseminating in their propaganda," Hua said.NOW WATCH: We asked a law professor about the likelihood of a Trump impeachmentSee Also:• A new Trump administration rule will deprive nearly 1 million school kids of automatic free lunches, official figures say• Nancy Pelosi took a photo that Trump tweeted to accuse her of having a 'meltdown' and made it her cover photo• Trump massively undermined Mike Pence's mission to stop Turkey's invasion of Syria, saying publicly that it's none of his businessLoad-Date: October 23, 2019End of Document

China, on a war footing against NBA over Rockets' support for Hong Kong protestsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 8, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 482 wordsBody"Fight for freedom. Support Hong Kong." Those are the eight words that Daryl Morey, manager of the Huston Rockets, posted last week on Twitter and that have caused a crisis between the Asian giant and the American competition.China has just celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of its Republic and Morey's statements have sat very badly in Beijing. The Rockets' manager expressed a personal opinion in his Twitter profile in favor of the pro-democracy demonstrations that have been going on in Hong Kong for months, a gesture that the Chinese government has not overlooked.Several Chinese companies have suspended their trade agreements with the Rockets, a boycott that has not curbed either Morey's own apologies, nor the statements of franchise owner Tilman Fertitta,claiming that his manager did not speak on behalf of the Team. His statements have not convinced tech giant Tencent (owner of the popular Messaging network WeChat and owner of Riot Games,creator of the popular video game'League of Legends'),which has announced that it would not will broadcast rockets games or give any news related to this team. It should be noted that Tencent is a strategic partner of ESPN and was the main gateway of the US media group in China's growing sports market.The sports channel of the Chinese state network CCTV 5,has also joined the blockade and in addition to not broadcasting the Rockets' games, has announced that it will also not broadcast any of the matches of the NBA teams that are in China doing the pre-season.That's not where the boycott ends. The ecommerce giantsTaobao (the Chinese eBay) and Alibaba have withdrawn all Rockets products from their online stores, while sportswear manufacturer Li-Ningand the Development Bank of  Shanghai Pudong have suspended all cooperation with this team.The Chinese basketball federation has also said it will suspend its relations with the team led by James Harden. And that at the head of the federation is an old acquaintance of the NBA, former player Yao Ming,once a star of the Rockets themselves.NBA releaseAlthough the message of discord has already been deleted from Morey's profile, the tweet continues to cause more consequences. China's blockade of the NBA has forced the American Basketball Association itself to rule on the issue. NBA commissioner Adam Silverhas issued a statement apologizing for reactions to Morey's tweet, but has insisted that from the competition they will continue to support the manager's right to freedom of expression The Rockets."We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of speech," the commissioner says, though he has also regretted that Morey has annoyed so many Chinese fans with his message. In this sense, Silver has asked people working directly in the NBA to "be sensitive" from the different cultures that follow the competition when posting a message on social media.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

Cotton, Colleagues Send Letter to Microsoft President Detailing Huawei's Threat to National SecurityTargeted News ServiceOctober 7, 2019 Monday 8:42 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1101 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, issued the following news release:Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) along with Senators Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Rick Scott (R-Florida), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), and Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) today sent a letter to Microsoft President Brad Smith in response to his recent comments that the U.S. government should provide more evidence of wrongdoing by Huawei so that business leaders can decide whether to continue doing business with the Chinese telecommunications company. The letter reproduces publicly available evidence of Huawei's spying, technology theft, and economic warfare, which illustrates the enormous threat Huawei poses to the national security of America and its allies. It goes on to recommend that the government look for appropriate ways to share intelligence about Huawei with affected businesses. The full text of the letter can be found below and by clicking here (https://www.cotton.senate.gov/files/documents/Microsoft.pdf).To: Brad Smith, President, Microsoft, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052Dear Mr. Smith,We're writing in response to a recent article in Bloomberg Businessweek, which includes your remarks about the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. You encouraged the United States government to disclose additional intelligence about Huawei's espionage, so that business leaders "can decide for ourselves" whether to continue dealing with the company.We appreciate Microsoft's communications with our offices and your understanding of the threats posed by Huawei. We also understand that many American companies have conducted business in good faith with Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies. While the U.S. government and American industry must take certain steps to protect our people and our telecommunications infrastructure, we do not want to cause undue harm to those American companies.We believe, however, that a review of publicly available evidence indicates that the security concerns about Huawei are real and urgent. To highlight those concerns to American citizens and businesses, we list below just some of this evidence:Espionage Activities- Huawei's president and founder, Ren Zhengfei, is a former engineer for the People's Liberation Army and a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP has office space and minders inside Huawei's Shenzhen headquarters.- Beginning in 2006, the Chinese government financed and built the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Huawei servers inside the building secretly transferred data to servers in Shanghai every night for five years until the theft was discovered. The AU replaced its Huawei servers at great expense, and declined an offer by China to help configure its new servers.- Last year, Huawei technicians collaborated with Ugandan intelligence officers to hack an encrypted messaging platform used by a political opponent of the regime.- Earlier this year, Polish authorities arrested a Huawei sales director and former Chinese diplomat on charges he was spying for the Chinese government.[4]- An independent research firm in the United States examined hundreds of Huawei products and "found Huawei devices to be less secure than comparable devices from other vendors" with "hundreds of cases of potential backdoor vulnerabilities...a large number of known vulnerabilities...and hundreds of potential 0-day vulnerabilities."- A recent think tank study reviewed the resumes of 25,000 Huawei employees and found several who were simultaneously employed by Chinese intelligence services.Technology Theft &#38; Economic Warfare- Huawei has received tens of billions of dollars in grants, export finance, and loan guarantees from China's state policy banks, which indicates the government's vested interest in Huawei's overseas expansion.- Huawei allegedly used shell companies in Iran and Syria to deceive European banks into clearing hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions that violated U.S. sanctions against doing business with the repressive regimes in Tehran and Damascus.- Earlier this year, the U.S. government indicted Huawei for stealing advanced robotics technology from T-Mobile in the United States. The company allegedly offered rewards to employees who stole trade secrets from competitors.- In 2003, Cisco filed suit against Huawei, alleging "systematic and wholesale infringement of Cisco's intellectual property." It was later established that Huawei copied proprietary source code from a Cisco router down to the letter, including coding errors, help screens, and user manuals. A third-party expert concluded the similarities between the two sets of code were "beyond coincidence," despite Huawei's claims to the contrary. The case was settled out of court.- In 2010, Motorola filed suit against Huawei after a Motorola employee with ties to Huawei was stopped from boarding a flight to Beijing with a carry-on bag full of confidential documents from Motorola. The lawsuit revealed that Motorola employees created a company to funnel Motorola's trade secrets to Huawei. The case was settled out of court.- A former cybersecurity executive for Nortel has implicated Huawei in the company's downfall, warning other companies against doing business with Huawei. He alleges Huawei was involved in cyberattacks that emanated from China, stealing business plans and intellectual property. These attacks contributed to Nortel's bankruptcy.This evidence, in conjunction with testimony from U.S. government officials and our allies, Britain, Japan, and Australia, makes a compelling case that Huawei serves as an intelligence-gathering apparatus for the Chinese state. As Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has said, "Huawei is the means by which China would get into our networks and our systems, and either attempt to extract information or to corrupt it, or to undermine what we're trying to do."Of course, the government has more classified evidence to support this case, and we sympathize with your expressed concern that Microsoft and other businesses are not privy to this intelligence. We believe the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the intelligence community could share more of this intelligence in an appropriate fashion to affected businesses. We would welcome further conversation with Microsoft and other businesses about coordinating such briefings.Thank you again for Microsoft's cooperation with our offices. And thank you for the many ways in which Microsoft works with our military, intelligence community, and law enforcement agencies.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6884039 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

He alleges Huawei was involved in cyberattacks that emanated from China, stealing business plans and intellectual property. These attacks contributed to Nortel's bankruptcy.This evidence, in conjunction with testimony from U.S. government officials and our allies, Britain, Japan, and Australia, makes a compelling case that Huawei serves as an intelligence-gathering apparatus for the Chinese state. As Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has said, "Huawei is the means by which China would get into our networks and our systems, and either attempt to extract information or to corrupt it, or to undermine what we're trying to do."Of course, the government has more classified evidence to support this case, and we sympathize with your expressed concern that Microsoft and other businesses are not privy to this intelligence. We believe the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the intelligence community could share more of this intelligence in an appropriate fashion to affected businesses. We would welcome further conversation with Microsoft and other businesses about coordinating such briefings.Thank you again for Microsoft's cooperation with our offices. And thank you for the many ways in which Microsoft works with our military, intelligence community, and law enforcement agencies.Load-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

Co expects production to be at the mid-point of its original guidance of 28,000-31,000 boe/day and expects capital spending to be at mid-point of $195-$225 mln.Preliminary total company production for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019 averaged 29,600 boe/d with the month of September averaging 31,700 boe/d, compared to June's average of 27,400. The month of September production is nearly 88% oil, an increase from 86% in 2Q19.This improvement is primarily attributed to BRY'ss capital deployment to grow its California production. Preliminary California production, consisting of 100% Brent-based oil, for the quarter is approximately 22,900 bbl/d, an increase of 10.4% compared with last quarter and 17.7% with 3Q18.16:35HA Hawaiian Holdings reports Sept traffic (revenue passenger miles) +3% yr/yr on an increase of 0.7% in capacity (available seat miles); raises Q3 estimates for operating revenue per ASM (25.21 -0.49)Q3 update: Total traffic increased 2.7 percent on a decrease of 0.4 percent in capacity. Load factor increased 2.7 points to 87.8 percent. Company also raised its estimates for operating revenue per ASM due to better than expected yields in long-haul markets, particularly in its International entity to down 0.5% - up 0.5% from down 1.5-4.5%; narrowed its estimates for operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and non-recurring items; narrowed its estimates for gallons of jet fuel consumed; and lowered its estimates for economic fuel cost per gallon.16:34ACGL Arch Capital estimates $65-75 mln of catastrophe losses related to third quarter events (41.63 -0.23)Arch Capital expects to report third quarter 2019 pre-tax catastrophe losses of approx. $65-75 mln, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums. These losses are primarily from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. At this time, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the scope of damage for these events, as well as the other global events. The company's estimate for these events is based on currently available information; actual losses from these events may vary materially from the estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations. The loss estimates exclude the operations of Watford Holdings. Pursuant to GAAP, the company consolidates the results of Watford in its financial statements, although it only owns approx. 11% of Watford's outstanding common equity.16:22WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 declined 0.5% on Monday in a session replete with trade speculation and indecision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD16:20QGEN Qiagen also announces CEO transition; CEO Peer M. Schatz to depart to pursue new opportunities (32.06 -0.29)Mr. Schatz, CEO, has notified the company that, after 27 years at QIAGEN, he has decided to step down as CEO and Chairman of the Management Board. He will remain with QIAGEN as Special Advisor to the Supervisory Board and transition into this role in the coming weeks. The Supervisory Board will now start a search for a permanent CEO. In the meantime, Thierry Bernard, SVP, Head of Molecular Diagnostics Business Area, will now act as interim CEO and work in tandem with Roland Sackers, CFO.16:11STL Sterling Bancorp to acquire $843 mln portfolio of middle market commercial equipment finance loans/leases from Santander Bank NA (SAN); expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2019 (19.34 -0.13)As of September 30, 2019, the balance of loans and leases outstanding to be acquired was $843 million. The portfolio has a weighted average tax-equivalent yield of approximately 4.3% and consists mainly of fixed rate loans and leases. The portfolio will be integrated into Sterling's established national Equipment Finance platform, resulting in a pro forma combined portfolio of approximately $2 billion in total loans and leases outstanding.16:09ILMN Illumina partners with QIAGEN (QGEN) to deliver in-vitro diagnostic tests (301.63 -0.71)IlLMN and QGEN announce a 15-year partnership intended to broaden the availability and use of NGS-based IVD kits, including companion diagnostics, for patient management.The agreement grants QGEN non-exclusive rights to develop and globally commercialize IVD kits to be used together with Illumina's MiSeq Dx and NextSeq 550Dx Systems.The agreement also includes rights for expansion of the partnership on future Illumina diagnostic systems. Both partners are also exploring opportunities for QIAGEN to develop and market companion diagnostics based on ILMN's TruSight Oncology assays that enable comprehensive genomic profiling of tumor samples in immunotherapy. ILMN and QGEN will cooperate to commercialize a menu of clinically validated workflows that combine QGEN's proprietary content and bioinformatics solutions. The partnership will initially focus on commercializing oncology IVD kits to support patient management and may expand in the future to include additional clinical diagnostic fields, such as cardiology, hereditary diseases, infectious diseases, as well as inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.16:08QGEN Qiagen reaffirms Q3 EPS, sees revenue below guidance (32.06 -0.29)Reaffirms Q3 adj. EPS $0.35-0.36 vs $0.36 S&P Capital IQ Consensus Estimate; total sales +3% ex-FX vs. +4-5% prior outlook, mainly due to significantly weaker-than-expected developments in China. Sales grew 6% ex-China.Initiatives announced to free up resources to invest in best growth opportunities, in particular new partnership with Illumina in NGS (next-generation sequencing) clinical decision-making.16:06RRGB Red Robin Gourmet names David Pace as Board Chairman; Pattye Moore to retire as Board Chair November 1, 2019 (32.73 -0.08)Mr. Pace was appointed to Red Robin's Board on August 6, 2019 as part of a refreshment that resulted in the addition of three new, independent directors. Mr. Pace most recently served as Chief Executive Officer of Jamba Juice.16:02AQN Algonquin Power & Utilities commences underwritten marketed public offering of 21,520,804 common shares (14.06 +0.12)The net proceeds from the Offering will be used to partially finance certain of the Company's previously-announced acquisitions, to partially finance the Company's renewable development growth projects, and for general corporate purposes.15:37PD PagerDuty (-3%) hits new low ahead of tomorrow's IPO lockup expiration; the Tufin Software (TUFN) lockup also expires tomorrow while Jumia (JMIA) is on Wednesday (26.94 -0.76)The $2 bln digital operations management enterprise software company trades at just under 10x forward sales.The Tufin Software (TUFN) IPO lockup expiration is also tomorrow.Jumia's (JMIA) IPO lock up expires on Wednesday, October 9.15:36SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- RingCentral (RNG) continues to progress following Avaya Holdings (AVYA) partnership news -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersCRWD (68.41 +7.16%): Continued volatility; the stock has now been boosted by circa +21% during the most recent three sessions as the software sector generally recuperates from recent pressure. (Related: DOCU, WORK...) RNG (174.45 +6.83%): Augments Friday's all-time highs on above average volume; Friday's breakout followed co's announcement of an exclusive UCaaS provider partnership with Avaya Holdings (AVYA), in which co concurrently purchased a minority stake. MTCH (78.07 +4.89%): Upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura, which revises its gross margins estimates for co higher, and to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank, which sees recent pullback in the shares as an overreaction and which views the fundamentals of co's business as "untarnished" even amid recent competitive developments and legal action.Large Cap LosersWES (23.66 -5.77%): A headline from Reuters has indicated, citing "people familiar with the matter," that Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has shelved plans to divest part of its ownership in co for the time being after failing to attract sufficiently high bids. Energy sector underperforms relatively.

Treasuries started the cash session on a lower note after another quiet overnight affair. Markets in China and Hong Kong were closed for holidays while the overnight news flow was limited. There was some renewed focus on the next round of U.S.-China trade talks, which are expected to take place on Thursday and Friday in Washington. Bloomberg reported over the weekend that Chinese officials have narrowed the range of subjects that will be discussed during these meetings. However, it remains to be seen how much leeway U.S. negotiators will allow on key issues like intellectual property protections and state subsidies. Midday action saw Treasuries slip to fresh lows, but longer tenors stopped their retreat above Friday's lows while the 2-yr note finished near its low from Thursday. Tomorrow's session will feature a $38 bln 3-yr Treasury note auction. The sale will be followed by a 10-yr note reopening on Wednesday and a 30-yr bond reopening on Thursday. The U.S. Dollar Index climbed 0.2% to 98.97. Yield Check: 2-yr: +7 bps to 1.46% 3-yr: +7 bps to 1.42% 5-yr: +6 bps to 1.39% 10-yr: +4 bps to 1.55% 30-yr: +3 bps to 2.05%News: Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, delivered opening remarks at the premiere of a documentary about Marriner Eccles in Salt Lake City, Utah. Mr. Powell did not comment on monetary policy, though he highlighted the importance of an independent central bank. President Trump tweeted this morning that he will "totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey" if Turkey does anything in Syria that President Trump considers to be "off limits." The tweet was published after a Sunday announcement from the White House, which indicated that U.S. forces would not stop Turkey from conducting a military operation in Northern Syria. Kansas City Fed President, Esther George, spoke over the weekend, reiterating her opposition to the rate cut in September, according to Bloomberg. Ms. George said that she would support a rate reduction if she sees evidence of a sharper slowdown in growth. The European Commission is reportedly calling for "pre-emptive" fiscal stimulus in the eurozone. British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will challenge the Benn Bill, which blocks a no-deal Brexit, in the Supreme Court. Protests across Hong Kong continued during the weekend and there were multiple reports of bank ATMs running out of cash. Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, is reportedly facing pressure from lawmakers to increase fiscal spending. China's September FX Reserves decreased to $3.092 trln from $3.107 trln. Japan's August Leading Index decreased to 91.7 from 93.7 while Coincident Indicator decreased 0.4% m/m (last 0.2%). September FX Reserves dipped to $1.32 trln from $1.33 trln. Australia's September AIG Construction Index decreased to 42.6 from 44.6.

Consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.25%, with revolving credit decreasing at an annual rate of 2.25% and nonrevolving credit increasing at an annual rate of 7.75%. The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.

Any such changes, it was said, will be managed through administrative regulations.The market is in the midst of unwinding the previous spike.This is unlikely to be the last time this week that the market is taken for a ride on an ostensible trade negotiation headline catalyst. Be on guard then for "misdirection" because of it. It's not until the principles start talking late in the week that there will be any true sense of what is coming out of these negotiations.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 are basically flat.13:43TALKX Market Briefing: Chasing after a hopeful trade headlineThe stock market saw a quick spike up on a headline from a FOX Business reporter, who said the Chinese Commerce Ministry is ready to do a deal on the parts of the negotiations both sides agree on and are prepared to lay out a timetable for the harder issues to be worked out next year.It was a Pavlovian reaction for the stock market and the algorithms that move it, but this news lacks any true meaning because it is a natural expression of what could be taken for granted ahead of any such reporting. Sure, the Chinese are willing to do a deal on mutually agreeable parts, just as they have been all along, and, well, here the market is wondering what the two sides will actually agree upon other than more agricultural purchases and a pushback perhaps of other tariff deadlines.Moreover, it's hard to believe the harder aspects of a trade deal will be easier to work out next year when the election is even closer.Alas, the market reacted to this headline because that's what it does, but it isn't worth chasing at this point because the market doesn't really know what it's chasing.The Russell 2000 is up 0.6%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; and the Dow and S&P 500 are both up 0.2%.13:34COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $8.70 (0.57%) at $1504.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.10 lower (0.57%) at $17.54/oz Dec copper settled $0.01 higher (0.39%) at $2.57/lb13:17MIK Michaels Stores jumps 4% after announcing the complete rollout of UPS (UPS) Access Point locations to more than 1,100 Michaels Companies stores nationwide (9.50 +0.38)As the first of the recently announced retail partners to offer UPS Access Point locations, customers are now able to ship UPS packages directly to a Michaels store, as well as drop off pre-labeled shipments and make returns to e-commerce retailers that offer UPS drop off, all while picking up their favorite seasonal and DIY essentials.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:ETRN Jan20 17.5 calls (volume: 5490, open int: 0, implied vol: ~54%, prev day implied vol: 43%).

Today's price action has largely reflected a lack of conviction as trade speculation ramps up in front of key trade talks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) are little changed, too.Deputy-level trade talks are expected to continue today and tomorrow, with higher-level talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday. NEC Director Larry Kudlow said earlier today that China's "mood" seems to be a little better this week, somewhat muddling a Bloomberg story that suggested China is currently less interested in a complete deal that resolves key structural issues.Some have pointed to Mr. Kudlow's comments as a reason for the market's bounce from its lows this morning, yet there appears to be mixed signals from the trade-sensitive S&P 500 materials (+0.4%), industrials (-0.1%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors. The utilities sector (-0.4%) is today's laggard.Instead, today's price action appears to be driven in part by technical factors. At its low, the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average (2941) before buyers quickly stepped in on no specific news to lift it back above the key technical level and jump-start a move to session highs.Apple (AAPL 229.06, +2.05, +0.9%) remains in focus as it continues its ascent back toward all-time highs on no "new" news today. On a related note, Silicon Motion (SIMO 37.69, +1.84, +5.1%) raised its guidance following a report from last week that indicated Apple asked its suppliers to increase production for its iPhone 11.In other matters, labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.92, +0.10, unch) and the UAW took a "turn for the worse" over the weekend, but shares of GM have erased early losses.

A survival analysis using a time-dependent Cox regression model showed that the difference in probability of survival between treated patients and untreated natural history control patients was highly statistically significant (p<0.0006). In addition to the survival benefit, the vast majority of treated patients (94.7%) had either improved (68%) or stabilized (26%) responses in major functional domains. Among clinical responders, a subset demonstrated profound responses, in some cases re-acquiring previously lost motor milestones.Safety & TolerabilitySafety data from RETRO indicated that SET is generally safe and well-tolerated. Most reported adverse events were considered not related to study drug (199 of 292), with mild or moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event, occurring in 63% of patients.Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 14 subjects (37%). The majority of SAEs were deemed related to TK2d; two patients experienced three events related to study drug alone (kidney stone, kidney stone removal, diarrhea).Two adult-onset patients stopped treatment due to asymptomatic increases in aminotransferase liver enzymes (no increase in bilirubin levels), which resolved upon discontinuation of treatment.08:07WIRES On The WiresAllergan plc (AGN) announced the launch of three new over-the-counter REFRESH RELIEVA products: REFRESH RELIEVA, REFRESH RELIEVA PF (preservative-free) multidose, and REFRESH RELIEVA FOR CONTACTS.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/AOther news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019 metrics; net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 mln, from $243.7 mln in the prior year September period (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 mln, or 2.1%, vs the same prior year one-month September period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors.

HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

The 100% owned Amaruq satellite deposit is located approx. 50 km northwest of the Meadowbank mine, which in turn is located approx. 110 km by road north of Baker Lake in the Kivalliq District of Nunavut, Canada. Development of the Amaruq project was approved in February 2017 by the company's Board of Directors as a satellite deposit to supply ore to the existing Meadowbank mill.Amaruq ore processing commenced in August 2019 using low-grade stockpiles. In the third quarter of 2019, production at the Meadowbank Complex totaled 48,869 ounces of gold, which included 13,588 ounces from Meadowbank and pre-commercial payable gold production at Amaruq of 35,281 ounces, compared to pre-commercial production guidance of 40,000 gold ounces. During the third quarter, mining activities at Amaruq continued to be affected by slower than expected dewatering activities. Given the slower than expected ramp up of mining activities, the company took the opportunity to accelerate planned maintenance to the milling and crushing circuits, which was originally scheduled for 2020. As a result, the mill was temporarily shut down in mid-September and is expected to restart on or about October 14.As a result, production guidance at the Meadowbank Complex for 2019 is now anticipated to be 200,000 ounces of gold (previous forecast of 230,000 ounces). Despite the lower forecast for the Meadowbank Complex, the company's FY19 production guidance of 1.75 mln ounces of gold remains unchanged.17:03ATR AptarGroup to acquire 49% equity interest in BTY, a Chinese color cosmetics packaging manufacturer (116.56 -0.77)AptarGroup has signed an agreement to acquire a 49% equity interest in three related BTY companies: Suzhou Hsing Kwang, Suqian Hsing Kwang, and Suzhou BTY, collectively referred to as BTY. The BTY entities are Chinese manufacturers of high-quality, decorative metal components, metal-plastic sub-assemblies, and complete color cosmetics packaging solutions for the beauty industry. Financial details will be disclosed upon successful completion of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2019, and the purchase will be funded with available cash on hand.16:38BRY Berry Petroleum reaffirms 2019 annual production and capital spending guidance (9.28 -0.05)BRY reaffirms its full year production and capital spending guidance for 2019. Co expects production to be at the mid-point of its original guidance of 28,000-31,000 boe/day and expects capital spending to be at mid-point of $195-$225 mln.Preliminary total company production for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019 averaged 29,600 boe/d with the month of September averaging 31,700 boe/d, compared to June's average of 27,400. The month of September production is nearly 88% oil, an increase from 86% in 2Q19.This improvement is primarily attributed to BRY'ss capital deployment to grow its California production. Preliminary California production, consisting of 100% Brent-based oil, for the quarter is approximately 22,900 bbl/d, an increase of 10.4% compared with last quarter and 17.7% with 3Q18.16:35HA Hawaiian Holdings reports Sept traffic (revenue passenger miles) +3% yr/yr on an increase of 0.7% in capacity (available seat miles); raises Q3 estimates for operating revenue per ASM (25.21 -0.49)Q3 update: Total traffic increased 2.7 percent on a decrease of 0.4 percent in capacity. Load factor increased 2.7 points to 87.8 percent. Company also raised its estimates for operating revenue per ASM due to better than expected yields in long-haul markets, particularly in its International entity to down 0.5% - up 0.5% from down 1.5-4.5%; narrowed its estimates for operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and non-recurring items; narrowed its estimates for gallons of jet fuel consumed; and lowered its estimates for economic fuel cost per gallon.16:34ACGL Arch Capital estimates $65-75 mln of catastrophe losses related to third quarter events (41.63 -0.23)Arch Capital expects to report third quarter 2019 pre-tax catastrophe losses of approx. $65-75 mln, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums. These losses are primarily from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. At this time, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the scope of damage for these events, as well as the other global events. The company's estimate for these events is based on currently available information; actual losses from these events may vary materially from the estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations. The loss estimates exclude the operations of Watford Holdings. Pursuant to GAAP, the company consolidates the results of Watford in its financial statements, although it only owns approx. 11% of Watford's outstanding common equity.16:22WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 declined 0.5% on Monday in a session replete with trade speculation and indecision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD16:20QGEN Qiagen also announces CEO transition; CEO Peer M.

The portfolio has a weighted average tax-equivalent yield of approximately 4.3% and consists mainly of fixed rate loans and leases. The portfolio will be integrated into Sterling's established national Equipment Finance platform, resulting in a pro forma combined portfolio of approximately $2 billion in total loans and leases outstanding.16:09ILMN Illumina partners with QIAGEN (QGEN) to deliver in-vitro diagnostic tests (301.63 -0.71)IlLMN and QGEN announce a 15-year partnership intended to broaden the availability and use of NGS-based IVD kits, including companion diagnostics, for patient management.The agreement grants QGEN non-exclusive rights to develop and globally commercialize IVD kits to be used together with Illumina's MiSeq Dx and NextSeq 550Dx Systems.The agreement also includes rights for expansion of the partnership on future Illumina diagnostic systems. Both partners are also exploring opportunities for QIAGEN to develop and market companion diagnostics based on ILMN's TruSight Oncology assays that enable comprehensive genomic profiling of tumor samples in immunotherapy. ILMN and QGEN will cooperate to commercialize a menu of clinically validated workflows that combine QGEN's proprietary content and bioinformatics solutions. The partnership will initially focus on commercializing oncology IVD kits to support patient management and may expand in the future to include additional clinical diagnostic fields, such as cardiology, hereditary diseases, infectious diseases, as well as inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.16:08QGEN Qiagen reaffirms Q3 EPS, sees revenue below guidance (32.06 -0.29)Reaffirms Q3 adj.

Treasuries started the cash session on a lower note after another quiet overnight affair. Markets in China and Hong Kong were closed for holidays while the overnight news flow was limited. There was some renewed focus on the next round of U.S.-China trade talks, which are expected to take place on Thursday and Friday in Washington. Bloomberg reported over the weekend that Chinese officials have narrowed the range of subjects that will be discussed during these meetings. However, it remains to be seen how much leeway U.S. negotiators will allow on key issues like intellectual property protections and state subsidies. Midday action saw Treasuries slip to fresh lows, but longer tenors stopped their retreat above Friday's lows while the 2-yr note finished near its low from Thursday. Tomorrow's session will feature a $38 bln 3-yr Treasury note auction. The sale will be followed by a 10-yr note reopening on Wednesday and a 30-yr bond reopening on Thursday.

Mr. Powell did not comment on monetary policy, though he highlighted the importance of an independent central bank. President Trump tweeted this morning that he will "totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey" if Turkey does anything in Syria that President Trump considers to be "off limits." The tweet was published after a Sunday announcement from the White House, which indicated that U.S. forces would not stop Turkey from conducting a military operation in Northern Syria. Kansas City Fed President, Esther George, spoke over the weekend, reiterating her opposition to the rate cut in September, according to Bloomberg. Ms. George said that she would support a rate reduction if she sees evidence of a sharper slowdown in growth. The European Commission is reportedly calling for "pre-emptive" fiscal stimulus in the eurozone. British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will challenge the Benn Bill, which blocks a no-deal Brexit, in the Supreme Court. Protests across Hong Kong continued during the weekend and there were multiple reports of bank ATMs running out of cash. Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, is reportedly facing pressure from lawmakers to increase fiscal spending. China's September FX Reserves decreased to $3.092 trln from $3.107 trln.

Consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.25%, with revolving credit decreasing at an annual rate of 2.25% and nonrevolving credit increasing at an annual rate of 7.75%. The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.

Any such changes, it was said, will be managed through administrative regulations.The market is in the midst of unwinding the previous spike.This is unlikely to be the last time this week that the market is taken for a ride on an ostensible trade negotiation headline catalyst. Be on guard then for "misdirection" because of it. It's not until the principles start talking late in the week that there will be any true sense of what is coming out of these negotiations.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 are basically flat.13:43TALKX Market Briefing: Chasing after a hopeful trade headlineThe stock market saw a quick spike up on a headline from a FOX Business reporter, who said the Chinese Commerce Ministry is ready to do a deal on the parts of the negotiations both sides agree on and are prepared to lay out a timetable for the harder issues to be worked out next year.It was a Pavlovian reaction for the stock market and the algorithms that move it, but this news lacks any true meaning because it is a natural expression of what could be taken for granted ahead of any such reporting. Sure, the Chinese are willing to do a deal on mutually agreeable parts, just as they have been all along, and, well, here the market is wondering what the two sides will actually agree upon other than more agricultural purchases and a pushback perhaps of other tariff deadlines.Moreover, it's hard to believe the harder aspects of a trade deal will be easier to work out next year when the election is even closer.Alas, the market reacted to this headline because that's what it does, but it isn't worth chasing at this point because the market doesn't really know what it's chasing.The Russell 2000 is up 0.6%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; and the Dow and S&P 500 are both up 0.2%.13:34COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $8.70 (0.57%) at $1504.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.10 lower (0.57%) at $17.54/oz Dec copper settled $0.01 higher (0.39%) at $2.57/lb13:17MIK Michaels Stores jumps 4% after announcing the complete rollout of UPS (UPS) Access Point locations to more than 1,100 Michaels Companies stores nationwide (9.50 +0.38)As the first of the recently announced retail partners to offer UPS Access Point locations, customers are now able to ship UPS packages directly to a Michaels store, as well as drop off pre-labeled shipments and make returns to e-commerce retailers that offer UPS drop off, all while picking up their favorite seasonal and DIY essentials.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:ETRN Jan20 17.5 calls (volume: 5490, open int: 0, implied vol: ~54%, prev day implied vol: 43%).

Today's price action has largely reflected a lack of conviction as trade speculation ramps up in front of key trade talks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) are little changed, too.Deputy-level trade talks are expected to continue today and tomorrow, with higher-level talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday. NEC Director Larry Kudlow said earlier today that China's "mood" seems to be a little better this week, somewhat muddling a Bloomberg story that suggested China is currently less interested in a complete deal that resolves key structural issues.Some have pointed to Mr. Kudlow's comments as a reason for the market's bounce from its lows this morning, yet there appears to be mixed signals from the trade-sensitive S&P 500 materials (+0.4%), industrials (-0.1%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors. The utilities sector (-0.4%) is today's laggard.Instead, today's price action appears to be driven in part by technical factors. At its low, the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average (2941) before buyers quickly stepped in on no specific news to lift it back above the key technical level and jump-start a move to session highs.Apple (AAPL 229.06, +2.05, +0.9%) remains in focus as it continues its ascent back toward all-time highs on no "new" news today. On a related note, Silicon Motion (SIMO 37.69, +1.84, +5.1%) raised its guidance following a report from last week that indicated Apple asked its suppliers to increase production for its iPhone 11.In other matters, labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.92, +0.10, unch) and the UAW took a "turn for the worse" over the weekend, but shares of GM have erased early losses. Mr. Kudlow commented on the situation, saying the strike is not helping the economy.U.S. Treasuries are pulling back from last week's advance, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up six basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.89. WTI crude is trading 1.8% higher at $53.74/bbl after a steep decline last week.12:49SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (8.27 mln -3.3%)Materials: CLF (9.07 mln +1.36%), FCX (8.85 mln +1.36%)Industrials: GE (16.29 mln -0.06%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (17.15 mln -6.79%), ROKU (13.48 mln -1.53%), F (10.45 mln -0.11%), M (9.05 mln +1.2%)Information Technology: AMD (20.69 mln +0.65%), AAPL (14.76 mln +0.84%), AVYA (9.56 mln +7.27%)Financials: BAC (16.01 mln +0.07%), ITUB (12.73 mln -2.73%), TQQQ (10.35 mln +0.26%)Energy: CHK (24 mln -0.74%), SWN (9.82 mln +0%), RIG (9.24 mln +1.65%), ECA (8.79 mln +0.79%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: AKCA (6.81x +29.25%), TAK (6.03x -0.12%), XENT (3.41x -11.26%), BLUE (2.36x -0.85%), DBVT (1.81x -4.6%)Consumer Discretionary: LIND (2.56x +1.38%)Information Technology: RNG (3.76x +6.58%), AVYA (3.49x +7.27%), SIMO (2.76x +4.9%), SPWR (2.15x -3.05%), PSDO (1.95x +0.15%), FSLR (1.86x -3.35%)Financials: PPR (2.08x +0%), NEWT (1.88x -1.82%)Energy: EURN (2.77x +4.47%), TGP (2.62x +1%), BPT (1.78x -7.59%)Consumer Staples: SMPL (5.52x -3.19%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: AKCA (19.56 +29.25%), GTS (14.85 +7.65%), CYH (4.1 +7.05%)Industrials: MAXR (8.07 +6.68%)Consumer Discretionary: ASNA (0.36 +13.54%), JCP (1.02 +10.7%), OSTK (11.14 +9%), SIG (17.63 +8.49%)Information Technology: AVYA (14.19 +7.27%), RNG (174.04 +6.58%)Energy: TK (4.04 +9.19%), HPR (1.35 +7.14%), ESV (4.56 +7.04%), MDR (1.74 +6.75%), TUSK (2.27 +6.57%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.25 +10.62%), RAD (8.18 +7.77%)Utilities: PCG (11.6 +6.67%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: XENT (15.06 -11.26%), RDUS (23.63 -8.23%), ADAP (1.12 -8.2%), ALLK (72.41 -6.39%), RCUS (8.24 -6.26%), SRPT (82.74 -6.24%), DBVT (8.5 -4.6%), EPZM (10.41 -4.32%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.09 -7.26%), NIO (1.51 -6.79%), PDD (31.16 -6.57%), GPRO (3.8 -4.41%)Information Technology: XELA (1.31 -5.07%)Financials: JEF (17.32 -5.87%), QD (6.49 -5.47%)Energy: BPT (8.16 -7.59%), HCLP (1.44 -5.59%), AR (2.75 -5.17%)Consumer Staples: FIZZ (46.43 -4.89%)12:46AAPL Apple (+1%) hits 52-week high, within 2% of last October's record high (229.34 +2.33)Apple hit a 52-week high today after breaking out on Friday following a report from the Nikkei Asian Review that the iPhone maker asked suppliers to boost production based on solid demand for the new lower end iPhone 11.

The ASCEND balloon did show statistically significant differences in several important secondary endpoints directly attributable to the drug, mometasone furoate, including reduction in inflammation and polypoid edema at all timepoints through day 30.

The price target hike is predicated on expectations for a continued rebound in consumer demand for video cards and a jump in sales of products to data center customers, who are expected to upgrade their systems in late 2019/early 2020.Shares of NVIDIA are up 40.0% since the end of 2018, but that strong gain masks significant volatility that the stock has had to endure in 2019. The company will face easier yr/yr comparisons starting with its Q3 report expected in mid-November, but a new challenge has emerged in the form of stiffer competition from AMD (AMD 29.40, +0.39, +1.4%), which can impact NVIDIA's pricing power.11:57NAT Tanker/Shipping stocks outperforming as industry rates continue to advance (3.08 +0.29)TNK +10.83%, NAT +10.57%, TNP +8.12%, TK +7.70%, DSSI +6.89%, ASC +5.78%, GLOG +5.74%, FRO +5.35%, DHT +4.65%, EURN +4.32%, SB +3.63%, GLOP +2.76%, GNK +2.44%, CPLP +2.21%, etc...This morning, Nordic American commented on the 'exceptionally strong tanker market':"[T]he international shipbroking firm of Clarkson Platou Research reported the largest week-on-week increase in the history of their freight index.

Presently the Suezmax spot market is reported to about $68,000/day, and rising. The NAT operating costs are about $8,000/day per ship. A seasonal upturn was already in the making.

The latter is probably responsible for a portion of the former, yet other factors are also in play:A wait-and-see stance in front of the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China this week in Washington.Ongoing evidence of foreign economic struggles, which manifested themselves in a 0.6% m/m decline in German factory orders in August and a drop in the eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence Index for September to -16.8 from -11.1 in August.Reports that contract negotiations between General Motors (GM 34.71, -0.20, -0.6%) and the UAW have taken "a turn for the worse," which is raising residual concerns about manufacturing sector conditions and U.S. growth prospects.NEC Director Kudlow said a short time ago in a Fox News interview that the GM strike is not helping the economy; however, he also said China's mood seems to be a little better this week and that something positive happening this week is possible, although he doesn't want to make any predictions.The stock market was rebounding from opening losses when Mr. Kudlow made his remarks and continued that rebound effort after the remarks were made, even though his China trade talk angle has been heard before.In any event, the major indices are mixed amid a lack of conviction on the part of buyers and sellers who are likely cognizant that it will be a seesaw this week with respect to speculative trade talk outcomes.The Russell 2000 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%.10:21RNG RingCentral (+6%) extending Friday's breakout to new highs after becoming the exclusive provider of UCaaS solutions to Avaya (AVYA) (173.21 +9.91)The deal made RNG the exclusive provider of Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solutions to Avaya.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/AOther news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019 metrics; net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 mln, from $243.7 mln in the prior year September period (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 mln, or 2.1%, vs the same prior year one-month September period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired.

Data also showed that meaningful long-term reductions in TD were achieved regardless of whether patients responded after two weeks.Neurocrine Biosciences also presented a post-hoc analysis of KINECT 3, the pivotal Phase III study, indicating that both the 40 mg and 80 mg doses of INGREZZA improved TD as early as two weeks in adults with TD, as measured by global clinician and patient scales.17:03ADMA ADMA Biologics files for $200 mln mixed securities shelf offering (4.14 -0.03)16:32ASR Grupo Aeroportuario Del Sureste reports that total passenger traffic for September increased 5.5% yr/yr (155.80 +2.21)Passenger traffic increased 2.0% in Mexico, 8.4% in Puerto Rico, and 12.1% in Colombia.16:23VRCA Verrica Pharmaceuticals CFO Chris Degnan to resign effective on October 18 (14.48 -0.31)Mr. Degnan's resignation did not result from a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices, including its controls or financial related matters.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

Police shoot protester in Hong Kong on China's National DayUPIOctober 1, 2019 Tuesday 11:23 AM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 604 wordsByline: THOMAS MARESCADateline: Dec. 31 BodyOn a day that China put on a display of military might to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, widespread protests in Hong Kong escalated to a new level of violence that saw police shoot a protester in the chest with a live round.The victim, a high school student, was reported to be in critical condition by local media.Video of the shooting, which shows an office firing at the protester's chest at close range, was captured by a number of sources, including the University of Hong Kong Student Union's Campus TV, which posted it on its Facebook page.A statement from Hong Kong activist group Citizens Press Conference condemned what it called "the new heights of police heartlessness.""[The police] have turned into an armed terrorist organization against its people," the statement, which was co-signed by political party Demosisto and other activist groups, read.Clashes between protesters and police took place throughout the day and continued late into the evening in multiple locations throughout the city. Police forces deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse crowds and made multiple arrests while protesters set fires and vandalized specific targets, such as subway stations and outlets of Chinese state-owned businesses such as the Bank of China.According to the Hong Kong's Hospital Authority, 51 people were injured on Tuesday, including two in critical condition and two in serious condition.Protesters defied a police ban on holding a rally and marched from Causeway Bay to the Central district, dressed in black and carrying black flags on what organizers called a day of mourning. Many threw joss paper, or "spirit money" traditionally burned for ancestors, to add to the funereal spirit of the march."Today is China's National Day, and we are marching to mourn their 70th anniversary," Lee Cheuk-yan, a former politician who was one of the organizers of Tuesday's march, told UPI. "For 70 years, [the Chinese government] has persecuted people and many have died. We are mourning for the dead and we will continue to fight for democracy."On Tuesday morning, Chinese President  boasted in a speech that no force could hinder China's development."There is no force that can shake the foundation of this great nation," Xi said, according to an official translation of his address. "No force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation forging ahead."Xi reviewed a military parade of some 15,000 troops and a trove of the communist state's latest hardware including advanced hypersonic and intercontinental missiles."When we look at China's military parade, it shows us that they have nothing but brute force," said Lee. "They want to threaten us, but this march today without any permit shows the defiance of the people of Hong Kong."Another protester, Wong Cheung, 70, said he didn't bother watching Beijing's display of might."I don't want to see it," said Wong. "We're not scared of them. We must fight for the future of Hong Kong."Hong Kong's protest movement has entered its 18th week with little sign of fading. What began as a response to a proposed extradition bill that would have sent fugitive criminal suspects to mainland China has evolved into a movement looking to hold onto autonomy in legal and political affairs under Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" arrangement with Beijing.The protesters have put forth five demands, which include not just the withdrawal of the extradition bill, but an investigation into police brutality during the demonstrations, amnesty for arrested protesters and direct elections to choose the city's politicians.Load-Date: October 2, 2019End of Document

Students Participate in Rally Supporting Hong Kong, Denouncing Hengdian VentureThe Wesleyan Argus: Wesleyan UniversityOctober 15, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1956 wordsByline: Jocelyn Maeyama, Serena Chow, News Editor and Assistant News EditorBodyHannah Reale, Contributing PhotographerStudents participated in a solidarity rally for Hong Kong outside of Usdan on Friday, Oct. 11, joining 22 other cities that also demonstrated. Organizers of the rally also added the denouncement of Wesleyan University's proposed joint venture with Hengdian Group to the rally's platform, declaring the two issues were inextricable from one another, which incited backlash from students online before the rally.One of the rally organizers, Joy Ming King '20, said that, because of the proposed joint venture's connections to the Chinese Communist Party , students who wished to stand in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong as they face government crackdown must also oppose the joint venture.Since June of this year, protesters in Hong Kong, including Wesleyan students, have engaged in sustained resistance against the CCP and the local government. While the Hong Kong protests began in direct response to an extradition bill that protesters view as a violation of Hong Kong's constitution, demands have broadened to address the escalating police violence, the rising number of protesters arrested under charges of rioting, and universal suffrage.In February 2019, the Wesleyan administration was approached by the Chinese corporation Hengdian Group and the public university Shanghai Theatre Academy with the proposal of establishing a joint venture campus in Zhejiang, China. In this joint-venture proposal, a CCP secretary would serve as the leader of the new university, tasked with more broadly considering the mission of the joint-venture campus and its relation to the CCP's mission. Representatives from Hengdian visited Wesleyan in spring 2019, after which Wesleyan sent a delegation to China.The Facebook event that King created for the rally called upon members of the campus community to show their support of Hong Kong and oppose the joint venture. "The Wesleyan community must stand together in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong as they continue their struggle for freedom and self-determination," King wrote in the Facebook event. "We must also show firm opposition against the proposal for Wesleyan to partner with a large corporation affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party in building a campus in China. If Wesleyan is serious about upholding its values as a progressive institution, it must not fall into complicity with the forces of authoritarianism, exploitation, and colonialism."Two nights before the rally began, students began expressing strong dissatisfaction on Facebook with how rally organizers linked supporting Hong Kong with denouncing Wesleyan's proposed joint venture with Hengdian Group. Students also voiced concerns that the actions of the CCP might be conflated with the beliefs of all mainland residents. Yongxi Tan '22 was one of the few students from mainland China who attended the rally. She shared how certain existing narratives about the CCP can make it challenging for her to feel comfortable expressing her thoughts. "I was scared because I felt many of my friends would disagree with me or I would offend many people I care about-especially my Hong Kong friends," Yongxi Tan said. "I find it really hard to speak up because people keep telling me that my country is a tyranny, it's bad, and my country is doing a lot of bad stuff. Subconsciously, I have been telling myself that I don't think my country is a great country, or [that] my country is honorable enough to say that it is a free country, a liberal country. But now, when I really think about what it means to be a Chinese [person], I guess it means a lot of things. And having people impose the idea of what they think my country looks like is a very unfair conversation."King began the rally by leading attendees, numbering around 30 and increasing to 70 as the rally progressed, in chants, including "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong" and a call-and-response chant: "When Hong Kong is under attack what do we do?" "Stand up, fight back."Following the chants, King began his speech by extending solidarity towards mainland Chinese students and emphasizing that members of the community must look out for each other."I understand that there are people on this campus, especially folks, friends of mine from mainland China for whom these issues and this rally today brings up some very uncomfortable feelings," King said. "Nobody should deny those feelings, especially in a moment where Sinophobia, racism for Chinese people, is on the rise."According to his own research, King said that the Hengdian Group has close ties to the CCP, connecting this involvement to the experiences he had when protesting in Hong Kong."For me, if you're serious about being in solidarity with Hong Kong, it means looking at what this administration is trying to do behind our backs," King said. "Trying to start a campus in partnership with not just any corporation, which by itself would be a very problematic thing, but a corporation that I believe that I've seen from my research...has deep connections with the very people who are subjecting my friends and my family at home to unspeakable terror right now."To conclude his speech, King called for continued, civil conversations, reminding attendees of the pressures and real risks both mainland and Hong Kong students are feeling. King then urged attendees to go to the Oct. 30 town hall for students to share thoughts on the potential joint venture with the administration, which was announced in an email from the administration on the evening before the rally. "This rally is the beginning of that conversation, and as we proceed with this conversation, I hope it can be done in the most thoughtful and respectful way possible with every member of this campus, including students from mainland China," King said.Quentin Tan '22, a rally attendee from Malaysia, pointed out how difficult holding these conversations can be."It's hard for me to mediate positions when people, friends from home are divided on this issue," Quentin Tan said. "Returning to campus, some friendships and bonds we had fell apart due to these political developments and movements."Attendees then held a minute of silence in support of Hong Kong, and King requested for attendees to put on face masks that were being distributed. While giving face masks to attendees, rally organizers explained that Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam recently invoked sweeping emergency powers to ban face masks that protesters wore to protect their identities at demonstrations, a move intended to quell pro-democracy protests but has only intensified anger and distrust of the government.Another rally organizer, Bryan Chong '21, elaborated in a post-rally interview why the organizers wanted attendees to wear masks."Like I said in my speech at the rally, we simply live in different realities and the idea behind the masks is we want to give students a taste of what it feels like to be a protester that is afraid of having their identity be unmasked and having their identities be exposed to the powers that be that control their livelihood," Chong said.Following the request for attendees to put on their face masks, Chong then delivered a speech about how much his reality back home in Hong Kong differs from his reality here at Wesleyan. In addition to highlighting how these protests have exacerbated political differences between parents and students to the point where parents are kicking students out of their homes, Chong spoke about how these protests are affecting even children."This is a reality where children, literal children, have had to put on masks, that have to strike from school because the government has forced them to," Chong said. "These are children that know they are growing up in an age of fear. They know that they are fighting for a future that they have no choice but to live in. They are out there fighting for my freedom to be here speaking to you all today. It's a tough reality. It's a harsh reality."Nevertheless, Chong continued, he has seen how engaging in these acts of resistance inspire political awakenings in youth, showing them that change is possible through action."It's also a reality that has brought many beautiful things that I have seen," Chong said. "This is a reality that has empowered children with the knowledge, with the capacity, with the agency to know that they can make change as well, that they don't have to be obedient. They don't have to just listen. It's their time and it is our time as well to stand up."Thailand resident Bright Palakarn '20 then delivered a speech arguing that this joint venture would only lend credence to the CCP and serve its interests.Before the rally, students debated online whether the joint venture would deliver a "true" liberal arts education with its close ties to the CCP, with some saying that the CCP imposes significant educational constraints on institutes of higher education. If a liberal arts education is possible under the CCP, others argued that introducing this type of education system could pave the way for reform in the CCP.Rally attendees then walked to South College, where King then led protesters in chants, such as "No deal with the CCP.""Again, I'm speaking for myself here, not for anyone else," King said after the chants concluded. "And if you have different opinions, yes, let's have a respectful conversation."King ended the protest by leading attendees in one final chant: "We'll be back."In holding further conversations, students have voiced concerns that continued demonstrations on campus reflect what they believe to be an oversimplified narrative of the CCP."I personally have a lot of issues with the CCP, but at the same time they are very conflicted feelings," Yongxi Tan said. "The only reason why my grandparents were able to go to school or go to work was because the CCP was more focused on farmers and gave them access to education and resources.... But at the same time, a lot of the policy-making and form of the government I personally strongly disagree with. I went to an international school, and I grew up learning United States history, so it was really hard for me to find it reasonable for my government to be like this.... I think these complexities of feelings should not be ignored when we are telling the story of the Chinese government."One point of contention was the level of control the CCP has in China. Some students believe the Chinese government is more totalitarian than others do, which could affect whether the CCP secretary in charge of the joint venture would have a more symbolic or functional role in running the school.However, students have voiced that to deny the reach of the CCP is to inherently dismiss the lived experiences of all those suffering under the CCP regime and to stand in opposition to the fight of Hong Kongers.In reflecting on what solidarity means to him, Chong highlighted that students do not have to be directly suffering under tyrannical rule to take a stand against it. "Solidarity to me means the recognition that you do not have to be suffering under a barrage of rubber bullets, tear gas, and police batons to fight tyranny," Chong said after the rally. "Solidarity to me means the recognition that tyranny is a constant threat and the fight against it must be constant. Solidarity to me means the recognition of the capacity of each of us-no matter where we are, no matter who we are-to recognize what is right and what is wrong and stand up for those beliefs and to ask the dangerous questions and to question unrelentingly why things are the way they are."Serena Chow can be reached at sschow@wesleyan.eduJocelyn Maeyama can be reached at jmaeyama@wesleyan.eduLoad-Date: October 15, 2019End of Document

CHINESE NATIONAL PLEADS GUILTY TO RUNNING 'BIRTH TOURISM' SCHEME THAT HELPED ALIENS GIVE BIRTH IN U.S. TO SECURE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIPUS Fed NewsSeptember 17, 2019 Tuesday 8:56 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 583 wordsBodySANTA ANA, Calif., Sept. 17 -- The U.S. Department of Justice's U.S. Attorney's office for Central District of California issued the following press release:A Chinese national pleaded guilty today to federal criminal charges for running an Orange County-based "birth tourism" business that catered to wealthy pregnant clients and Chinese government officials, charging them tens of thousands of dollars to help them give birth in the United States so their children would get U.S. citizenship.Dongyuan Li , 41, of Irvine, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud and one count of visa fraud. Li was one of 19 defendants named in a series of indictments unsealed earlier this year. She is the first of the charged operators of birth tourism businesses to plead guilty. The remaining defendants either are pending trial or are fugitives.Li admitted in her plea agreement that, from 2013 until March 2015, she operated a birth tourism company in Irvine and in China called You Win USA Vacation Services Corp. You Win would assist pregnant foreign nationals - typically from China - to travel to and remain in the United States to give birth so their children would receive birthright U.S. citizenship, according to the plea agreement.According to a January 2019 federal grand jury indictment against Li, You Win advertised that it had served more than 500 Chinese birth tourism customers seeking U.S. birthright citizenship for their children. The indictment details that Li used 20 apartments in Irvine, charged each customer between $40,000 and $80,000, and she received $3 million in international wire transfers from China in two years.Some You Win customers coached by the company made false statements on their visa applications and to U.S. immigration officials, Li's plea agreement states. Li also admitted that the customers were advised on how to pass the U.S. Consulate interview in China, including by falsely stating that they were going to stay in the United States for only two weeks, when in reality, they planned to stay for up to three months to give birth.Li further admitted that her customers bypassed U.S. immigration controls by booking two flights - the first from China to Hawaii and the second from Hawaii to Los Angeles International Airport - because they thought it would be easier to clear U.S. Customs through Hawaii. Li's customers also were coached how to trick U.S. Customs at ports of entry by concealing their pregnancies, according to the plea agreement.In October 2013, Li made a $30,965 rent payment for Irvine apartments used in her birth tourism operation, and in November 2013, she made a $30,321 rent payment for those apartments, the plea agreement states.As part of her plea agreement, Li agreed to forfeit more than $850,000, a Murrieta residence worth more than $500,000, as well as several Mercedes-Benz vehicles.United States District Judge James V. Selna scheduled a December 16 sentencing hearing, at which time Li will face a statutory maximum sentence of 15 years in federal prison.This case was investigated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigation. The Irvine Police Department provided substantial assistance.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Charles E. Pell of the Santa Ana Branch Office.

Sen. Cruz Highlights 'Friends &#38; Allies Tour' Throughout Indo-PacificTargeted News ServiceOctober 18, 2019 Friday 8:12 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1495 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: HOUSTON, Texas BodySen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued the following news release:U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released a video highlighting his 'Friends &#38; Allies Tour,' which included visits to Pearl Harbor, Tokyo, Taiwan, New Delhi, and Hong Kong. Watch the video here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTr7ts4VpA0&#38;feature=youtu.be).While in Taiwan, Sen. Cruz called into CNBC's 'Squawk Box' and discussed his tour and the Chinese Communist Party's efforts censor American citizens through economic blackmail and coercion. He also participated in a press conference with Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaushieh Joseph Wu. While in Hong Kong, Sen. Cruz appeared on CBS's 'Face the Nation' where he discussed his meetings with Hong Kong protest leaders, dissidents, and activists, as well as the need to combat China's tyrannical actions throughout the region and the world.CNN: US Sen. Ted Cruz rips Beijing 'dictatorship' during Hong Kong visit"US Sen. Ted Cruz on Saturday condemned China's handling of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, saying suppression of free speech in the territory showed fear from what he called a 'dictatorship' in Beijing. 'The Chinese Communist government, I believe, is terrified of the protesters in the streets in Hong Kong,' the Texas Republican told reporters at an afternoon meeting at the US consul general's residence in the Chinese special administrative region. 'President Xi is terrified of millions of people in Hong Kong but even more than that millions of people in China yearning to live free.' The 2016 US presidential candidate was dressed head to toe in black, in what he called a sign of solidarity with Hong Kong protesters -- men and women, boys and girls, he said -- who have adopted that as their de facto uniform. 'A protester has power that makes the dictatorship tremble,' Cruz said, comparing a man shot in the chest by a Hong Kong police officer last week to the protester who stared down a column of tanks in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 anti-government protests."Reuters: HK leader ditches meeting Ted Cruz, says the U.S. senator"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam scrapped a meeting with U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, the highest profile U.S. politician to visit the city since anti-government protests broke out more than four months ago, the senator said on Saturday. Lam's office had requested that the afternoon meeting be completely confidential and that Cruz refrain from speaking with the media about it, Cruz told journalists in Hong Kong. 'She seems to misunderstand how free speech operates, and also how freedom of the press operates,' said Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas and a vocal critic of China who was stopping in Hong Kong for two days as part of a regional tour."Hong Kong Apple Daily: Cruz: the Hong Kong people are in the interest of the United States"Cruz said that he was wearing all black clothes and walked with the demonstrators. 'The things that are happening in Hong Kong are very encouraging. We have seen more than 2 million people on the streets for freedom, democracy, and the suppression of the Chinese government. I think It is in the interest of the United States to support Hong Kong people.'"Hong Kong Free Press: 'We are not afraid': Over a thousand Hongkongers protest gov't use of emergency law"Meanwhile, US Senator Ted Cruz arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday, according to the group Hong Kong Autonomy Action which seeks US help in Hong Kong affairs. The group held signs that read 'Senator Ted Cruz, thanks for helping us!' whilst welcoming him. Cruz arrived after a trip to Taiwan, where he met Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Cruz is one of the most high profile US politicians to voice support for the Hong Kong protests."Breitbart: Hong Kong Protesters Fly Taiwan's Flag on Its National Day"Taiwan's National Day commemoration was attended by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), the first sitting American senator to attend the event in Taipei in 35 years. 'At this time, when the eyes of the world are focused on Hong Kong and the brutal repression of Hong Kong, the stakes of fighting for democracy and fighting for freedom are that much more important, and that is what Taiwan rightly symbolizes for the world,' Cruz said at a meeting with President Tsai."Taiwan News: US senator attends Taiwan's National Day ceremony for first time in 35 years"US Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), the first sitting U.S. senator to attend Taiwan's National Day ceremony in 35 years, joined Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu at a press conference at Shangri-La's Far Eastern Plaza Hotel in Taipei on Wednesday (Oct. 9), just before Taiwan's National Day celebration. Cruz expressed his support for a Free Trade Agreement with Taiwan, which he noted is the U.S.'s 11th largest trade partner, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also called the relationship between the two countries "incredibly important" in both economic and military aspects, saying he hopes to see Taiwan participate in the Rim of the Pacific Exercise, the U.S.-led international naval exercise that is the largest of its kind in the world."Taipei Times: Taiwan-US relations 'incredibly important': Cruz"Taiwan-US relations are "incredibly important" in diplomatic, military and economic areas, as well as regarding efforts by the two sides to defend human rights and freedom, US Senator Ted Cruz said in Taipei yesterday. One of the most outspoken supporters of Taiwan, Cruz is the first US senator to attend Double Ten National Day celebrations in 35 years, Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu said as he welcomed Cruz at a news conference at the Shangri-La Hotel. This is a time when the world's attention is focused on Hong Kong, where people demonstrate their courage as they stand up for democracy and freedom, said Cruz, a member of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. People in Taiwan and Hong Kong are important, as 'the Chinese government is terrified by the idea of freedom,' he said, adding that Beijing also hopes the world will forget the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989."Fox News: Ted Cruz commends Taiwan's stand against 'communist oppression' as China censorship controversies rage"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, commended Taiwan's stand against 'Chinese communist oppression,' in a video tweeted Thursday, as multiple controversies have swirled around U.S. companies allegedly acquiescing to China's restrictive speech rules. Standing in Taiwan's 'Liberty Square,' Cruz congratulated the Taiwanese people on their national day, known as 'Double 10 Day,' and extolled the relationship between the United States and Taiwan. Cruz has been traveling in Asia this week; he visited Japan on Wednesday. 'I'm here in Taiwan in Chaing Kai-shek square, also known as Liberty Square, celebrating the people of Taiwan who stand up against Chinese communist oppression and stand up for freedom,' he said. 'America is proud to be allies with the people of Taiwan.'"The Hindu: China is the most significant geopolitical threat: U.S. Senator Ted Cruz"Senate Foreign Relations Committee Member says U.S. has been urging allies and friends not to allow Chinese surveillance. India will risk losing intelligence from the U.S. if it allows Chinese telecom major Huawei to be part of its 5G infrastructure, a U.S. Republican Senator said during a visit to Delhi that coincided with Chinese President Xi Jinping's arrival in Chennai. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who also plays a crucial role in the U.S. reaction to developments in J&#38;K, told The Hindu that while 'legal questions' were for India to resolve internally, escalating India-Pakistan tensions were a cause for worry in America. 'The U.S. has made it clear that it would be severely constrained in sharing intelligence with any nation that installs Huawei equipment; that undermines U.S. national security and that of any country that installs it,' asserted Mr. Cruz, who also met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan and business chambers in the capital."Pen News: India appreciates US role in countering terrorism"'New Delhi, Oct 11: India and the US on Friday discussed ways to further strengthen the bilateral defence relationship and the former appreciated the role played by the US in countering terrorism. US Senators Ted Cruz (Republican - Texas) and Maggie Hassan (Democrat - New Hampshire) called on Defence Minister Rajnath Singh here. During the meeting, Mr Singh expressed satisfaction over the progress made in the partnership between both the nations. The Defence minister termed US as the world's oldest democracy and one of the most important and trusted partners of India. Saying that India-US cooperation has seen tremendous growth in the last five years, Mr Singh expressed hope that the strategic partnership will expand and flourish further in the coming years."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6898002 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 19, 2019End of Document

The US just moved ahead of China in quantum computing. But the race isn't over yetCNN WireOctober 24, 2019 Thursday 1:09 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1661 wordsByline: Analysis by James Griffiths, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Sometimes being first isn't all it's cracked up to be. Google raced past China this week in the quest for "quantum supremacy" with its claim that a machine developed by the company can solve a problem in 200 seconds that would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10,000 years. But just as the Soviet Union was the first to put both a satellite and a human being into orbit, before going on to lose the space race, China may be poised to outstrip any American achievements in a specific field of quantum technology --- communication. Beijing's gains in this area --- which could make its communications unhackable --- may leave US spies in the dark just as the US-China rivalry is heating up, a prospect that has led to great alarm in Washington. Quantum supremacyWhile Google's announcement has drawn skepticism from some of its rivals, and this would not be the first time a claim of "quantum supremacy" has been rebuffed, it nevertheless represents a clear step towards the rise of quantum computers. "This is a hugely important milestone for the field," said Joe Fitzsimons, chief executive of Horizon Quantum Computing. "The Google result shows that for the first time there is a quantum processor that can do something that a conventional computer cannot do, or at least that a conventional computer cannot do without enormous effort."In normal computers, data being processed exists in one state at a time --- a one, or a zero. Quantum computers, on the other hand, manipulate qubits, which can simultaneously be both a one and a zero, or any combination of the two. The difference means much faster processing speeds, and potentially solving problems and processing data that would take traditional machines millennia. This will have applications well beyond physics and mathematics. Quantum computers could lead to breakthroughs in self-learning artificial intelligence (AI), provide medical insights by simulating incredibly complex biological molecules, and simultaneously break all existing cryptographic keys while setting the stage for uncrackable quantum encryption. The last point is why many nation states --- led by the US and China --- have taken a strong interest in quantum computing. The first country to achieve quantum encryption could theoretically go completely "dark" to its rivals, hiding all its information from traditional digital surveillance methods. On the flip side, major gains in quantum computing could undo existing means of keeping data secret. Quantum computers refer to supercomputers, like that built by Google, which use qubits to process huge amounts of data that would be beyond the capabilities of traditional machines. Quantum communication uses the nature of quantum particles to encrypt data in a way that it cannot be put under surveillance without warning the people being watched. "Quantum computers are coming, and if it's going to be five, 10 or 15 years before we can decrypt any messages sent in the past, that definitely sends a chill down the spine of any security agency around the world," said Dimitris Angelakis, principal investigator at Singapore's Center for Quantum Technologies. But while Google may have made an important step this week, the company is by no means alone in investing in quantum computing research, and the next major milestone --- an unambiguous demonstration of quantum advantage --- remains out of reach. "Quantum advantage means demonstrating computational supremacy for a meaningful problem, showing that a quantum processor has been built which is more useful than a conventional computer for at least one problem," said Fitzsimons. "The path to large-scale quantum computing is more of a marathon than a sprint. The current result certainly places Google at the front of the pack, but there is still a long way to the finish line." If Google is leading the pack, most of the runners clustered behind it are not fellow Silicon Valley companies, but their Chinese competitors and the country's well-funded research institutes. Chinese qubits In an influential paper last year for the Center for a New American Security, authors Elsa Kania and John Costello wrote that "China is positioning itself as a powerhouse in quantum science." "At the highest levels, China's leaders recognize the strategic potential of quantum science and technology to enhance economic and military dimensions of national power," they argued. "These quantum ambitions are intertwined with China's national strategic objective to become a science and technology superpower." For years now, China has been pouring billions of dollars into funding quantum research, with a particular focus on uncrackable encrypted communication, enabling it to dodge US surveillance.The leading institution in this field is the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), one of the country's most prestigious schools, based in Hefei near Shanghai. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited USTC in 2016, where he met with Pan Jianwei, the schools' vice president and China's "father of quantum." Pan is widely recognized as one of the foremost experts in this field, and was named as one of Nature's top ten people who mattered in science for 2017, for having "lit a fire under the country's efforts in quantum technology." UTSC has led efforts to build a China-wide quantum communications network, which would link Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and five other cities via satellites and fiber-optic cables. In a presentation at a conference in Shanghai in August co-organized by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a United Nations body, Pan explained how quantum satellites could be used to provide "unconditional security" in transmitting data that would be unhackable and impervious to surveillance. He also led the research team behind Micius, the world's first quantum satellite, launched by China in 2016. Named for the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi, the satellite successfully managed a video call in 2017 between Beijing and Vienna using quantum encryption, making it impossible to eavesdrop upon. Pan is currently building a new quantum research lab in Hefei, into which the government has already pumped more than a billion dollars."We were only the follower and the learner at the birth of modern information science," he told MIT Technology Review last year. "Now we have a chance ... to be a leader."Fitzsimons, the Horizon CEO, said that while China "has had tremendous accomplishments in the field of quantum communication," it lags behind the United States and Europe in terms of quantum computation. "The focus on quantum computation in China came after quantum communication, and so is later in bearing fruit," he said. "In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in efforts both at universities in China and at technology companies, such as Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent and Huawei, focused on computation, which have begun to yield results." Quantum arms raceThe potential benefits of quantum computing to China have been recognized at the highest levels. Quantum technologies were highlighted in the country's 13th Five Year Plan, introduced in 2016, and that same year were mentioned by President Xi himself in a speech announcing the Belt and Road Initiative, his vast trade and infrastructure program.As well as government funding, private Chinese companies --- like their Silicon Valley rivals --- are also getting into the quantum research game: Alibaba alone has pumped around $15 billion into labs focused on future technologies, including quantum computing. According to Patinformatics, an analysis firm, Chinese organizations filed nearly twice as many patents related to quantum information technology (QIT) as the United States in 2017, and more than 70% of academic QIT patents since 2012 have been awarded to Chinese universities, with US institutions a distant second at 12%. Beijing's massive funding, and the advances by Chinese scientists, have not gone unnoticed in Washington. "China's advances in quantum science could impact the future military and strategic balance, perhaps even leapfrogging traditional US military-technological advantages," Kania and Costello wrote in their report, adding that the US "should build upon and redouble existing efforts to remain a leader, or at least a major contender, in the development of quantum technologies." Their recommendations, and similar warnings from other experts, have borne fruit. In August, President Donald Trump signed into law the National Quantum Initiative Act. The law authorized an extra $1.2 billion in research funding over five years, as well as establishing a national quantum committee to coordinate research and public funding for the field. In the statement enacting the law, the White House said it would "ensure continued American leadership in quantum information science and technology applications." While the United States is starting to match China for funding, Angelakis, the Singapore-based expert, said that "the biggest challenge in the field in the next few years is not money." As the field grows, competition for talent is also growing -- a factor that is affected by geopolitics and security concerns over quantum technologies. Angelakis compared the situation to early research into nuclear energy, which rapidly got overtaken and co-opted by governments, with research classified and sharing of discoveries limited, though he was quick to point out that quantum technology does not have as devastating a military use. "There's definitely a race going on and the current geopolitical situation is not helping the real science to progress," Angelakis said. "There are cases of people being denied visas ... it could be something that is very negative in the short term because we are still evolving this technology." CNN's Charles Riley contributed reporting. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

LeBron James weighs in on the NBA-China disputeCNN.comOctober 14, 2019 Monday 11:47 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: USLength: 725 wordsByline: By Jessie Yeung, CNNBodyBasketball star LeBron James has finally weighed in on the ongoing NBA-China dispute, criticizing Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey as being misinformed about the situation.The league is embroiled in a standoff with China after Morey tweeted his support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. Although Morey quickly apologized and deleted his original tweet, the damage was done. The league's Chinese partners suspended ties, state broadcaster CCTV halted all broadcasts of preseason matches, and the Chinese government said the NBA needed to show "mutual respect."Speaking to reporters on Monday before a game in Los Angeles, James, who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, called it "a very delicate situation, a very sensitive situation."When asked whether Morey should be reprimanded for his tweet, James responded, "I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say, and we all talk about this freedom of speech -- yes, we do all have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're only thinking about yourself.""I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke. So many people could have been harmed, not just financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do, even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too."He added that he and his teammates had stayed silent about the situation because they were "not informed enough" about it, and that "I'm not here to judge how the League handles the situation.""I just think that when you're misinformed or you're not educated about something, and I'm just talking about the tweet itself, you never know the ramifications that can happen. We all see what that did -- not only for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well," he said.He made further comments on Twitter Monday night after video of his remarks went viral on social media."I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet," he wrote. "I'm not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that."He added that it had been "a difficult week" for the Lakers and the NBA."I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it."How one tweet became the NBA's worst nightmareThe NBA spat spiraled rapidly since Morey's original October 4 tweet of an image that read, "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong." The former British colony, now a Chinese territory, has been rocked by months of political unrest that have drawn increasingly harsh condemnation from Beijing.The tweet set off a firestorm in China almost immediately, and the NBA issued an official apology just days later, saying it recognized that Morey's views "have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable."The league has spent years and many millions of dollars investing in China, helping to build courts, giving broadcasting rights away for free and bringing its stars over for preseason games.China makes up at least 10% of the league's current revenue, according to one analyst, and the country is expected to contribute even more than that over the next decade, perhaps reaching 20% of the league's revenue by 2030.But the apology drew widespread and scathing bipartism criticism in the United States, and the NBA issued a stronger-worded statement emphasizing freedom of expression in an attempt at damage control.The next day, all 11 of the NBA's official Chinese partners suspended ties.Through all of this, NBA players have stayed relatively quiet, making James one of the first to speak out on the issue. When CNN's Christina Macfarlane tried to ask Rockets players James Harden and Russell Westbrook about the NBA's position with China, she was shut down by a Rockets' media officer."It's already been answered," the media officer said."This is a question that's not been answered. James?" Macfarlane responded, to which Harden stayed silent.Load-Date: October 15, 2019End of Document

CAMBODIAN MONKS, ACTIVISTS MARCH TO DEMAND CASINO'S DESTRUCTIONStates News ServiceOctober 16, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 612 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A group of Cambodian monks and environmental activists entered their second day of a nine-day march on Wednesday to the coastal city of Sihanoukville to demand the demolition of a shuttered Chinese-owned casino accused of polluting a local beach.Cambodian activists have long called for the demolition of the Jin Ding Casino and hotel on Koh Rong Samloem Island, a popular tourist destination, saying that if the structure is not torn down it will likely be reopened at a later date.The casino was ordered to close in May because it was operating without a license, promoting illegal online betting games, and releasing untreated sewage directly into the sea, but Cambodian authorities have delayed repeatedly fulfilling promises to tear it down.Speaking to RFA's Khmer Service on Wednesday, Buddhist monk Keut Saray said that authorities in Kompong Speu province, which lies along the protesters' route of march to the coast, had ordered local monasteries to refuse shelter to the group."Senior monks at two of those monasteries told me that officials from the Provincial Department of Cults and Religions had ordered them not to provide us with places to sleep," he said.Members of the group, which started from the capital Phnom Penh on Oct. 15 with two activists and three monks and now numbers ten, have vowed to continue with their march regardless, insisting that authorities now move ahead to demolish Jin Ding.Also speaking to RFA, Thun Rathaan activist with the environmental advocacy group Mother Naturesaid that after the monasteries turned them away, the group had slept in tents in an open field."We will keep going to fulfill our goal," he said. "We urge provincial authorities to follow through with what they said they are going to do after ordering the owner of the Jin Ding casino [to tear the facility down]."After leaving Phnom Penh, participants in the march were followed closely by police who monitored their progress and took photos, but police turned back as the march crossed into Kandal province, group members said, adding that the group's size has been kept small to avoid attracting troublemakers.Crime rises despite departuresChinese investment has flowed into Sihanoukville in recent years, but Cambodians regularly chafe at what they call unscrupulous business practices and unbecoming behavior by Chinese businessmen and residents.A report by the AFP news agency in January on how Sihanoukville had become a "sizeable gambling playground" for Chinese tourists said at least 50 Chinese-owned casinos were operating in the provinceSpeaking to RFA this week, Preah Sihanouk provincial deputy police chief Kol Phally said that the presence of Chinese nationals in Sihanoukville has meanwhile declined, with numbers going down by about half."We don't know exactly how many Chinese nationals have returned [to China], but we know that a lot of them are leaving. The numbers are not the same as they were before," he said.Sreng Vannya provincial coordinator for the Cambodian human rights group Licadhosaid however that crime in Sihanoukville continues to rise in spite of the departures of Chinese following a government crackdown in September on online gambling."In fact, things are worse, with growing numbers of killings, mutilations of corpses, and shooting in the streets," he said.Last month Cambodian authorities deported 142 Chinese nationals to China at the weekend for involvement in telecommunications fraud scams, loading them on two charter planes from Phnom Penh.Reported by RFA's Khmer Service.

CHINA KEEPS MUM ON HONG KONG WITHDRAWAL PLEDGE, QUESTIONS SUPPORTERSStates News ServiceSeptember 9, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 708 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:horities in the central Chinese province of Hunan have questioned more than 20 people after they took selfies with one hand covering their right eye as a gesture of support for the Hong Kong anti-extradition movement.The gesture refers to a woman known only by a pseudonym, Tsai Lam-miu, who made international headlines as she lay on a pavement during the protests bleeding from one eye after being hit by what was likely a rubber bullet found nearby.Anti-extradition protesters now regularly cover one eye in reference to her injury, and to protest police violence against them.Hunan-based rights activist Chen Siming, who launched the online support action, which he described as performance art, was called in for questioning by police in his hometown of Zhuzhou on Thursday and warned not to express support for the Hong Kong protests."I covered the right side of my face with my hand, and posted it to Twitter and to a WeChat group," Chen told RFA. "We have a regional WeChat group in Zhuzhou, Hunan, with more than 20 friends in it.""They also posted similar photos.""Covering our right eye with our right hand shows that we are sympathetic and supportive to the girl who lost her right eye in the protests," he said."It is also a complaint against the abuse of violence by the Hong Kong police," he said. "It also means that the whole world is paying attention to Hong Kong and supporting Hong Kong."'Everyone was questioned'Chen said 24 people in total had been contacted by police after posting the selfies."Everyone was questioned because of these photos," he said. "When they called me in for questioning, the police told me that I wouldn't want to go to jail, and that I don't have to go there.""They warned me in a threatening way not to keeping pushing it," Chen said.Chen's friend Ou Biaofeng was among the other activists questioned by police."They asked me why I wanted to post such a thing, and did I support independence for Hong Kong," Ou told RFA."They deliberately asked me some leading questions, and they also warned me not to speak out about Hong Kong in future," he said, vowing to continue to speak out nonetheless.He said the Hong Kong protesters had achieved an "initial, minor victory" last week when the city's leader Carrie Lam pledged that hugely unpopular amendments to its extradition laws enabling criminal suspects to be sent to face trial in mainland China would be formally withdrawn."It is an initial, minor victory, but it only addresses one of the five demands, so there are still four demands that have not been met," Ou said. "I hope the people of Hong Kong will continue to insist."Ou said he hopes Hong Kong will eventually achieve its goal of fully democratic elections for the post of chief executive, and for seats on the Legislative Council (LegCo).Announcement played downChina's state-run media has played down Lam's announcement that she will formally remove amendments to the Fugitive Offenders' Ordinance from the government gazette, a list of legislation to be debated by LegCo, when the legislature reconvenes in October following a refurbishment in the wake of its storming by protesters on July 1.Lam has asserted that Beijing respects and supports her decision, but Chen Kuide, executive chairman of the Princeton China Society, said Beijing's low-key response likely indicates some dissatisfaction."I don't think the Chinese government was happy with Lam's withdrawal of the amendments because there have been sources in the past indicating that the [ruling] Chinese Communist Party had hoped she wouldn't cave in to pressure to respond positively to the five major demands of the people of Hong Kong."But he said it could also be that Beijing simply wants to wait and see what happens next before commenting.Hu Ping, editor-in-chief of the U.S.-based Chinese-language political magazine Beijing Spring, said Beijing is biding its time."The Central Committee will understand and respect this," Hu said. "It will not necessarily feel the need to make strong statements, and official statements are likely to use more neutral wording."Reported by Gao Feng and Jia Ao for RFA's Mandarin Service.

Philippine police arrest over 500 mostly Chinese for fraudAssociated Press InternationalOctober 11, 2019 Friday 00:37 GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 377 wordsDateline: MANILA, Philippines BodyMANILA, Philippines (AP) - Philippine police and immigration authorities said they have arrested more than 500 illegally working foreigners, mostly Chinese involved in telecommunications and investment scams, in one of the biggest such mass arrests this year.The 542 foreigners, who were arrested Wednesday night in a raid on their company premises in metropolitan Manila, did not have work permits and were involved in defrauding victims mostly in China by blackmailing or tricking them into sending out money, said Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente and other officials.The Chinese government provided information that led to the arrests of more than 400 Chinese and other workers from Myanmar, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Indonesia, said police Maj. Gen. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar.The suspects were being interrogated in a police gymnasium because of their large numbers.Pictures of the raid provided by the Immigration Bureau showed the foreign workers, who included women, either standing up or seating in front of computer monitors with their hands clasped behind their heads in the company's office.Similar recent mass arrests indicate criminal syndicates involved in fraud and illegal online gambling may be trying to move their operations to the Philippines, Bureau of Immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval said. She said that immigration authorities and other law enforcers "have been working triple hard on ridding the country of these illegal aliens."Wednesday's arrests bring the number of arrested foreign workers to nearly 1,500, causing overcrowding at the Bureau of Immigration's detention center, which could only accommodate 140 detainees. Immigration officials plan to relocate detainees to a larger detention center and have tried to improve conditions in the current jail.Morente said those arrested faced deportation if they violated immigration laws but would have to be detained longer in the Philippines if they're convicted of crimes.Last month, immigration authorities, backed by army troops, arrested 324 Chinese accused of involvement in illegal online gambling and other crimes in a raid on eight hotels and other establishments in western Palawan province. Many of the Chinese lacked work permits and passports, officials said.Load-Date: October 11, 2019End of Document

POLICE IN CHINA'S GUANGXI ORDER LOCAL RESIDENTS TO REPORT FOR DNA SAMPLINGStates News ServiceSeptember 26, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 595 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China has implemented DNA collection programs in Guangxi and Xinjiang, while authorities in Zhejiang, Ningbo and Anhui have announced similar plans.Authorities in the southwestern Chinese region of Guangxi have called on local residents to present themselves for DNA collection over a three-month period lasting until the end of this year, RFA has learned.Police stations in Guangxi's tourist destination of Guilin have written to local residents calling on them to undergo blood tests and DNA sampling between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, according to a copy of the notice seen by RFA.The request was being made to "complete minimum data requirements for policing" and to "improve population management and control," the notice said.An officer who answered the phone at Guilin's Beimen police station on Thursday said at least one male from each family is expected to leave a DNA sample with police.A notice issued by the Guiqing police station in the same city titled "Regarding the collection of DNA and blood samples from male family members," claimed that the data would "enable us to better serve the welfare of the people."It said it had been ordered to begin DNA collection from Sept. 20 "according to orders from higher up."Similar DNA collection programs have already been implemented in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, while authorities in Zhejiang, Ningbo and Anhui have announced similar plans.Calls to the Guiqing police station rang unanswered during office hours on Thursday .An officer who answered the phone at Beimen station said the requirements could vary from district to district."I can confirm that we definitely have to collect [DNA]," he said. "When the time comes, we will be collecting it from one male [in each family]."Privacy concernsDNA's common use as a reliable identification for law enforcement agencies worldwide has sparked concerns among critics of the ruling Chinese Communist Party over privacy.Wang Dewang, who is based in Lu'an city in the eastern province of Anhui, said the mass DNA collection drives were a forcible violation of people's right to privacy."They are now taking the whole stability maintenance system out of Xinjiang and into the rest of China, Wang said. "This collection of DNA seriously violates human rights.""This is part of the stability maintenance system, which means that they'll be able to find out who you are in future through your family background even if you change your name entirely, just by taking blood from you and testing your DNA," he said."This already goes far beyond the imaginations of ordinary people, and also of the rest of the world," Wang said.A primary school teacher surnamed Meng from the eastern province of Shandong said she is firmly opposed to the authorities' holding more data on Chinese citizens."I don't agree with this: it's a matter of personal privacy," Meng said. "The problem is that the police station often doesn't handle cases or do things according to the law."Current DNA databases owned by Chinese police have an estimated 100 million samples of DNA from the population.Peaceful critics of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and rights activists have had their blood taken for testing, learning only afterwards that their DNA is now held on a police system.The Chinese government has never explained publicly why it is starting DNA databases for its citizens with a compulsory or semi-mandatory collection program.Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service.

American values or Chinese profits? US companies face crosswinds.; Vice President Mike Pence says the NBA acts like a "subsidiary of the authoritarian regime," in the latest sign of free-speech concerns with China.The Christian Science MonitorOctober 25, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: EconomyLength: 1430 wordsByline: Laurent Belsie Staff writerBodyA quarter-century ago, President Bill Clinton took a gamble on China. Instead of punishing Beijing for its human rights violations, he decided to engage it.The strategy seemed to work for a long time, with increasing trade paralleled by Chinese political reforms and, at times, cooperation with the West. But human rights violations and intellectual property theft didn't go away, China began championing state-owned businesses again, and President Xi Jinping pulled China back toward its more authoritarian past, including forcing foreign companies doing business in China to bend to its will.This thorny reality burst onto American consciousness this month due to one American's personal tweet in support of antigovernment protesters in Hong Kong. The problem: That American happened to be general manager of a team in the NBA, which has legions of fans in China. The resulting tremors in both nations have elevated a question that may persist as China's economic might grows: Does doing business with China mean silencing a portion of one's moral soul? The financial and ethical stakes are apparent. Beijing canceled NBA preseason broadcasts and has demanded an apology for the Houston Rockets official's tweet. Americans across the political spectrum condemned China's move as an attack on freedom of speech.All this adds tension to already fraught U.S.-China trade talks, strengthens the hand of those seeking a decoupling of the two economies, and pushes many U.S. companies and organizations into a seemingly untenable balancing act between American values and Chinese profits."The West needs to modify its approach," Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), writes in an email. "The Trump administration's approach of pressure is part of the broader search for a new strategy. They have not been successful, and the U.S. will eventually end up with a more nuanced mix of both engagement and pressure."A long-simmering issueChina's attempts to muzzle U.S. entities isn't limited to the NBA - nor is it new. In 2010, Google pulled out of China in part because of the regime's requirements that it censor politically sensitive material for Chinese users. And Beijing has long censored scenes of violence and sex from Hollywood films for cultural reasons. But the censorship has intensified and expanded in the past two years, China watchers say.Last year, Beijing pressured American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines to remove from their websites all references to Taiwan. The ongoing Hong Kong protests have caused even more hypersensitivity. In the past month alone, official pressure prompted Google to pull a mobile game about a Hong Kong protester from its app store. Apple deleted, reinstated, then deleted again an app that Hong Kong protesters used to track police. China also banned "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" after director Quentin Tarantino refused to change the portrayal of martial artist Bruce Lee in the film. China also deleted "South Park" episodes - and even online discussions of them on its version of the internet - after the Comedy Central show mocked Hollywood for making concessions to Chinese censors.  Notably, those changes were demanded for Chinese-language versions of movies and websites meant for China's domestic audience. What's different about the current NBA controversy is that China clamped down on an English-language tweet on a website not even accessible in mainland China.In doing so, it may have overreached. "The censorate is paying attention to behavior in any language on any platform anywhere in the world," says Dr. Kennedy of CSIS. "I'm actually not sure this is sustainable for Beijing to do."And it may not be the intention of the Chinese Communist Party to try to curb the West's free speech. "At home and abroad, the CCP is fighting a defensive ideological battle against liberal norms of democracy and human rights, but so far at least, it is not engaged in a determined effort to spread autocracy," writes Jessica Chen Weiss, a Cornell University professor and author of "Powerful Patriots: Nationalist Protest in China's Foreign Relations."It's also not clear that the negative reaction to the NBA tweet originated with the government, says Jennifer Pan, a Stanford University professor who studies Chinese political communication. "Usually, when protests happen against a foreign company, it's started by Chinese consumers" and the government follows. (The push to change "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" reportedly came from Mr. Lee's daughter, who didn't like the portrayal of her father in the film.)New backlash in U.S.Nevertheless, the moves by U.S. companies to accommodate Beijing have created a harsh backlash across the U.S. political spectrum this month: from Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York criticizing Apple in an open letter, to Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and Vice President Mike Pence criticizing the NBA.By "siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime," Mr. Pence said in a major foreign policy speech Thursday.The backlash could put new focus on the ideological currents beneath America's economic and technological rivalry with China. On the right, former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, for one, has welcomed the sudden attention on China. He advocates a complete decoupling from China. Ms. Warren has put forward a trade policy with such high human rights and environmental standards that trade experts say it would amount to a decoupling from China.The Trump administration, by contrast, is working on a trade agreement that would reform certain Chinese practices so the world's No. 1 and 2 economies would remain intertwined. In his speech, Mr. Pence made clear the U.S. did not seek a decoupling.All this leaves U.S. multinationals walking a tightrope, trying to preserve their business in China while not offending American politicians or consumers. The NBA, too, after apologizing to China, did affirm the Rockets official's right to express his opinion. The outlook for its business in China, estimated at between $4 billion and $5 billion a year, remains unclear as China's state-run broadcaster did not air the league's first games of the season this week, but the NBA's Chinese internet partner did livestream the opening game between the Lakers and Clippers in Los Angeles. "Companies are thinking very hard about how they are going to mitigate that risk," says Andrew Polk, a founding partner of Trivium China, a strategic advisory firm based in Beijing. "But for most of them, it's not an option not to be in China. The growth of the global economy is happening in Asia and it's centered in China. And if you want to be a company that's growing, you've got to find a way to tap into that demand. It is that simple."In a talk last week Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg cast his company as one that sought access to China hoping "we might help create a more open society." But the narrative was telling. Facebook now has "more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values we believe in," he said, after being rejected in those efforts. Decoupling? Not if you're Apple.The poster child for this quandary is Apple. More than 90% of its manufacturing and 20% of its sales come from China. Even if Apple wanted to leave, it would take three years to move 10% of its manufacturing production in the best-case scenario, says Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. And China is not eager to see Western companies leave. At times of peak iPhone production, such as now, Apple employs some 1.4 million Chinese."Ultimately, from a technology and from an ecosystem perspective, [China and the U.S.] rely on each other: One's the heart, one's the lungs," Mr. Ives says. "As much as they're in an old Western standoff, they both know what's at stake."In the long run, the most likely way forward is a U.S.-China trade agreement that would be more broadly focused than what the Trump administration is negotiating, says Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "What the United States is going to have to grapple with is the middle ground: Is there a way to do business with China without threatening your national security and undermining your core values?"And the prospect of decoupling?"There is a better chance of me playing in the NBA than that happening," says Mr. Ives of Wedbush. "And I'm 5'8"."Load-Date: October 25, 2019End of Document

Two U.S. citizens detained, charged with 'illegal' activity in ChinaUPIOctober 17, 2019 Thursday 10:06 AM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 342 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Oct. 17 BodyTwo U.S. citizens were arrested and are awaiting trial on charges of illegally transporting people across China's borders, Beijing's foreign ministry said Thursday.Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing two Americans, a man and a woman, were being detained in Jiangsu Province for breaking the law."Jacob Harlan and Alyssa Petersen, two Americans, systematically helped others secretly cross the border," Geng said. "The two people were detained Sept. 27 and 29, respectively."The Chinese government spokesman said Beijing has informed the U.S. consulate in Shanghai and U.S. diplomats in China have been allowed access to Harlan and Petersen.Harlan is the owner of China Horizons, an English language program that offers a "cultural experience for American students who teach English in Chinese schools," according to the company's Facebook page.Petersen, a student at the Idaho campus of  University from 2014 to 2017, was an employee of China Horizons who coordinated visas and travel arrangements, Voice of America reported.Last week, China Horizons said in a Facebook post the two Americans were being wrongfully detained."They are being charged for bogus crimes and their families are working on getting them international lawyers to help them get back home to the States," the company said in statement.The firm also said it is facing trouble because of the "increasing political and economic problems between the United States and China.""We are no longer able to send teachers to China safely," China Horizons said.Harlan and Petersen have been released on bail,  reported Thursday."We are aware of the detention of two U.S. citizens in Jiangsu, China and the charges being brought against them by the provincial government," a U.S. State Department official said on condition of anonymity, according to the report."We take seriously our responsibility to assist U.S. citizens abroad and are monitoring the situation."The U.S. State Department warned Americans in January to "exercise caution" when traveling to China.Load-Date: October 18, 2019End of Document

A VALUE-BASED TRADE POLICYStates News ServiceOctober 7, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 4670 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS):Scott Miller: I'm Scott.Bill Reinsch: I'm Bill. And we're the Trade Guys.Andrew Schwartz: You're listening to the Trade Guys, a podcast produced by CSIS where we talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand. I'm H. Andrew Schwartz, and I'm here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch, the CSIS Trade Guys. On this episode of the Trade Guys, we'll catch up on the latest trade news coming from Capitol Hill, where Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, is calling for the president to resolve the China trade war, and for Democrats to move on USMCA. Plus, we'll break down talk of the administration limiting US investment into China, a move that could have huge economic implications. We'll talk about all that and much more on this episode of the Trade Guys.Andrew Schwartz: Gentlemen, we're hearing some noise from Capitol Hill. Yesterday, senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, told CNBC Monday...Mitch McConnell: Well, I'd sure like for it to reach some resolution soon. It's been very tough on American agriculture, and my party is very deeply based in rural America and small town America.Andrew Schwartz: "I hope the president can get a good outcome here," McConnell said. It doesn't sound like a lot of pressure. It's slight pressure.Scott Miller: Yes. Well, the majority leader also said he admired the president's willingness to take on China.Andrew Schwartz: He did. He did.Scott Miller: The key to this comment is Senator McConnell is on the ballot, November 2020.Andrew Schwartz: And there's some farmers in Kentucky.Scott Miller: Last I checked. Yes, quite a few. I think what he's doing, he has a couple of audiences. He has his colleagues in the Senate, he has his constituents in the state of Kentucky, and he has the public at large. I think he has managed to, as we would expect from a very savvy, very clever political player, somebody who always plays the long game, to manage to make a comment that didn't really alienate anybody. But good politicians tend to have it both ways, which sounds like what he did.Andrew Schwartz: Well, in the great state of Maryland and the District of Columbia and I'm assuming Virginia too, it didn't rain for about a good month until yesterday.Bill Reinsch: Yes.Andrew Schwartz: And my lawn is the worst for it.Scott Miller: So, the little plot of land your farming is suffering from drought?Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, that's exactly. [crosstalk 00:02:21].Bill Reinsch: The soybean crop is in trouble. Is that what you're saying?Andrew Schwartz: Our soybeans are in trouble, so I'm imagining that the soybeans elsewhere in the mid Atlantic region in the South, other places are not doing so good, just from the drought alone.Scott Miller: Sure, weather has actually been tough this year, because many places, at least in the corn belt, started out very wet in the spring. Farmers couldn't get in their fields. And now it's been dry for some time. Weather is always a factor that farmers to have to deal with, and not much they can do about it except complain.Andrew Schwartz: They're dealing with weather, but they're also dealing with the trade war with China. And while they too probably admire the president for taking this up with China, and they've certainly backed him at the ballot box, there might be some question as to what they're going to do in this next election. If their lives are made miserable, including maybe some of them are going to lose their farms.Bill Reinsch: There's been an increase in farm bankruptcy. I think that's growing. There's been some erosion in support for him, not nearly as much as I would have thought simply based on the facts. The Trump administration's story has been, "Short term pain, long term gain. We're doing the right thing on China, and there's going to be some short term costs, but in the end we'll win and it will all sort itself out." And I think a lot of people have bought that. We've talked before about the widespread public support for the president doing something about China.Bill Reinsch: It's very hard to argue that he's conceptually wrong. It's the second half, it's the short term pain people, the farmers will say they're buying, but it's beginning to turn into longterm pain, and no gain. Because this has been going on now for a year. The tariffs keep getting broader and bigger, and they keep not selling very much stuff. So I think they're getting nervous.Scott Miller: A point that Bill's made frequently on this program, is that the president is not likely to conclude a deal anytime soon.Andrew Schwartz: That's right.Scott Miller: So the pain continues. This is going to be chronic. It's going to be one where while the policy seems right, the implementation will be questioned more routinely. And so there'll be a point of pressure, which is frankly, if we want self government, having political pressures usually a pretty good thing. So we'll see what becomes of it.Andrew Schwartz: So what's the breaking point for Republicans and what's the breaking point for the farmers?Scott Miller: I don't think we know yet. But I'm recalling our conversation with Blake Hurst of the Missouri Farm Bureau.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah.Scott Miller: And his comment is usually is the February, March period-Bill Reinsch: When they go back to the bank.Scott Miller: When farmers are seeking loans to get their crop in for the coming summer. That's the moment at which, if there's a crisis, it'll emerge about that time.Bill Reinsch: I think that's right. I also think in political terms, that our elections are always binary. It's not just about whether you're pro or against the ... For or against the incumbent. It's about who the other person is. I don't think you're going to see a material change in farmer support for Trump until there's a democratic nominee and they can make a judgment.Scott Miller: Yeah. Especially-Bill Reinsch: Is this guy going to be better than that guy?Scott Miller: Especially in a reelection race. It's almost never a referendum on the incumbent. It's a choice. It's basically four more years of time for a change. That's what the voters net down to, in an election like this one where you have an incumbent president running for reelection. And sometimes it's time for a change. As you're reading back in the election of 1912, where the incumbent president, William Howard Taft, got a whopping eight electoral votes. He carried two States, Vermont and Utah.Andrew Schwartz: That was because of Teddy Roosevelt.Scott Miller: Teddy Roosevelt split votes. But it was an odd election. But every once in a while it is time for a change. But that's the choice. Four more years, time for change.Andrew Schwartz: Well, there's a more recent example, I think in '08.Scott Miller: Yes.Bill Reinsch: The voters felt they'd eight years of Republicans and it was time for a change. And Obama won. I think frankly, at that point any Democrat would've won, because I think the people made up their mind, it was time for a change. I think in 2016 the same thing happened again. Now in 2020, Trump will say ... And question for elections is always, are you better off now than you were four years ago? And Trump is going to say yes, and his opponent, if he has any brains is going to say no. And then that's what the debate will be about. And in part it'll really depend, I think more on economic conditions a year from now, than it does right now.Andrew Schwartz: So when should the Republicans in Congress, McConnell and others, put more pressure on Trump to get a deal done sooner?Bill Reinsch: Well, I think from the McConnell quote, it's already beginning. And he's an awfully subtle person.Scott Miller: Yes.Bill Reinsch: And you have to really pay attention to figure out what he's talking about. I think as we head into bank season, January, February, March, I think the comments will become less subtle, and pressure will become greater. But there's a caveat there, which is, and I think we talked about this last time. One of the things that can happen with China in particular, is an interim deal, which Trump has said, "I'm not going to do." But on the other hand, he says a lot of things that he ends up doing the reverse. I think right now an interim deal would solve exactly the political problems you're talking about. It would be a deal in which the Chinese would buy more agriculture stuff, which they want to anyway. They have their own pork crisis as we've been reading. They've had to kill so many pigs. They want to buy more stuff. They've got a little bit to think they can do a little bit on IP, if they're promising not to steal anymore IP. Because they've promised that before. So promise it again.Bill Reinsch: That would do a couple of things. It would provide some relief for the farmers, it would relieve some of the pressure you're talking about. It would give Trump an excuse not to impose the next round of tariffs, which would avoid a consumer crisis around the holidays. And it kicks the can, six months. Now the problem of course is then, next spring you're going to have to do it again or come up with something else, because I think this is going to drag on for a year. But you can ameliorate the short term pressures by doing things like that.Andrew Schwartz: And he can still claim a win.Bill Reinsch: Sure. Yeah. Well he'll claim a victory regardless. But he has to say now that it's interim, because it won't be what he wants. He has to get over the reality that it won't be the greatest agreement in the world that he's expecting. So he's going to say, "This is just the first bite, and we're going to come back and [crosstalk 00:08:44]."Scott Miller: Which is frankly a good way to manage the politics. President Trump is unconventional, but every Republican president, unconventional or not, basically gets things done because of farm state Republican senators that he needs to rely on. That's how bills wind up getting to his desk. So he will be very attuned to that in the coming year, I'm sure.Andrew Schwartz: These are all the red states that put him in office-Scott Miller: Correct.Andrew Schwartz: So he has to ... Even though all these members are seriously loyal to him, if they're talking about their interest, and again, with them all politics is local. He's going to listen you think?Scott Miller: I think the thing to watch is the own party support among voters. At the moment, the president has about, according to Gallup, 88 or 90% support among Republican voters.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, he's very popular among-Scott Miller: As long as Republican senators' voters support the president, he'll get their support. So that's the variable to watch.Bill Reinsch: Keep in mind too, agriculture is an important issue in the States that you don't always think about. It's a big issue in Wisconsin. It's actually a big issue in Michigan.Scott Miller: Yes it is.Bill Reinsch: Sugar beets, fruit, a whole variety of things. Not exactly corn and soybeans. It's a big issue in Ohio. It's a very big issue in Pennsylvania, which I learned working for Senator Heinz. Nobody thinks that. Their father-in-law was a farmer and he grew cattle, but corn and soybeans as well.Scott Miller: Senator Stabenow from Michigan is still the ranking member on the agriculture committee in the Senate. So those states do factor in.Bill Reinsch: It's hard to envision Nebraska, or North or South Dakota tipping into the blue column in the election. It is not so hard to imagine a bunch of farmers in Wisconsin and Michigan staying home-Andrew Schwartz: Pennsylvania.Bill Reinsch: And Pennsylvania staying home, and then tipping the state.Andrew Schwartz: Ohio.Scott Miller: That's where the electoral dynamism is. Keep in mind the president won in 2016, he won the state of Michigan by 10,000 votes.Andrew Schwartz: Right.Andrew Schwartz: And we're hearing from our sources that in Southern Ohio, farmers are antsy, and they're not happy.Scott Miller: Yeah, it's tough. It bears watching carefully.Andrew Schwartz: So that is something to absolutely watch and we'll watch for signals from McConnell and his colleagues as we go along. Changing topics slightly, Peter Navarro sent a pretty strong signal on CNBC, where he said that recent reports that the United States is considering restrictions on Chinese companies. He called them grossly inaccurate. He called them fake news. There were reports that Chinese companies were going to be de-listed from the US stock exchange, and that US investors were not going to be able to invest in Chinese companies. And so Navarro comes on TV on CNBC and calls this fake news, but the investment community is taking this pretty seriously. What do you guys think about this?Bill Reinsch: I don't think it's entirely fake news. Secretary Mnuchin made a similar denial over the weekend, but it was carefully calibrated. It said, "We are not contemplating doing that at this time." And "At this time", is one of those phrases that, maybe we're contemplating doing it tomorrow, but we were not contemplating doing it on Saturday. I think it's very much on the table. I also don't think they're very near a decision. So in a sense Navarro is right in that I don't think anything's imminent, because it's complicated and there are a lot of different issues. Some of them are quite old. The delisting issue for example, that's a debate that's been going on for 10 years, that precedes this administration. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the PCAOB has for a long time been upset that what is essentially a clash of sovereignty.Bill Reinsch: If you want to be listed on American Stock Exchange, you've got disclosure and transparency requirements, that the PCAOB insists on. Chinese companies routinely don't meet those standards, because the Chinese government forbids them from doing so. And they regard it as an intrusion on their sovereignty. We've been negotiating this on and off with the Chinese for 10 years without success. It's a legal issue, because US regulatory law and obligations are clear. And I think people are running out of patients here with the fact that we have a double standard. So that's one issue. Now going much further and saying that for example, one of the other things on the table is that pension funds should not, or will not be able to invest in Chinese companies. Or will not be able to track indices that use Chinese companies as part of the index. That is much bigger, much newer, much more controversial, and I think it's far from being resolved.Scott Miller: And potentially dangerous. The United States economy benefits massively by our open investment policy. We are both the largest foreign investor abroad, and the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Thousands upon thousands of jobs come from foreign direct investment in the United States. And just to look in the financial markets, in the idea of exchange traded funds are listed. Any listing on our stock exchanges, it's our depth of capital markets that attracts capital to the United States. Also our neutral rules. So as this moves forward, Bill's right, there has been a long dispute about whether Chinese firms actually meet the standards that the US regulators apply. But I think you've got to look at this practically. What we want are neutral rules, and we want them for abroad, as well as for foreign firms at home. Now CFIUS provides that. The only investment review we have, is 40-Andrew Schwartz: CFIUS, the Process of [crosstalk 00:14:10]?Scott Miller: Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, is a review of national security and national security only. And many of us think that's the way it should be. But also if you get to the point of putting barriers to Chinese investment in the United States, whatever they may be, you've got to keep in mind, the amount of US investment, foreign direct investment and portfolio investment in the people's Republic of China. It dwarfs the Chinese investment in the US. And so if reciprocal barriers are put in place, you have massive US stranded capital in China. And all of a sudden American firms are hurt badly, that's going to show up in our economy.Bill Reinsch: There's also an argument that's being newly articulated, including by some people in the administration. And in fact CSIS is going to have a session on this in a couple of weeks. It's the values argument. There's a legal argument, and sort of an economic argument. What we're beginning to see is the value argument. The United States is a country that respects human rights, freedom, liberty, the private sector, opportunity. China's a country that respects none of those things. Do we really want to be doing business with them?Scott Miller: Now consider that policy angle in light of Senator Warren's trade policy that she's announced. It is a values base. It's a class warfare based, but it's also a values based trade policy. She wants to use the Trumpian leverage about openness to the US market. So we trade and invest in companies that share our values. This is not a sort of a wingnut idea.Scott Miller: Well it's a two wingnut idea.Scott Miller: It's a dual ... It's two way [crosstalk 00:15:45].Bill Reinsch: A classic illustration of what happens in trade is the far left and the far right end up shooting at the center. And this is another illustration of that. The far right says the Chinese are evil, because they're out to get us. And when I was on the China Commission-Andrew Schwartz: And what does the far left say?Bill Reinsch: The same thing from an economic perspective. What I discovered in the China Commission, was the Republican commissioners ... It was six and six. The Republican commissioners all thought China was an existential military threat. And the democratic commissioners all thought that China was an extensional economic threat. And they fed on each other, so they proved very apocalyptic negative reports. Senator Warren doesn't want to do business with countries whose policies oppress workers and don't respect the environment, and do a whole bunch of other [crosstalk 00:16:31]. That don't respect human rights. The right doesn't want to do business with a country that A, is communist, and B is-Andrew Schwartz: Takes advantage of us.Bill Reinsch: Take advantage of us, as pushing the countries around in the South China sea.Scott Miller: And it's a geopolitical threat.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. A national security threat.Scott Miller: Sure. Right.Bill Reinsch: None of which has a lot to do-Andrew Schwartz: And steals from us.Andrew Schwartz: A lot of things.Bill Reinsch: Well, yes. Then what happens if you take that view is, then you have a search for what can we do to get them? What can we do to hit them? And this is the new thing, delisting or going after the pension funds or their investments here.Scott Miller: Yes. So life is still hard to be a centrist on trade policy, but that's the right place to be.Andrew Schwartz: But you're saying there really is a case to limit US investment in the Chinese market? Both from the right and the leftBill Reinsch: This is more about Chinese investment in the US market. Well, no, it's both.Scott Miller: It's both.Andrew Schwartz: One of the things that Navarro and Mnuchin denials of this story was they wanted to calm US investors.Bill Reinsch: Yeah. It's about decoupling. That's the fashionable word these days, and it's another way to pull the two economies apart. To say we don't want your money and you can't have our money.Andrew Schwartz: And what does that do ultimately?Bill Reinsch: Slows down growth in both countries and it retards growth. It also retards innovation.Scott Miller: Yes.Bill Reinsch: People will tell you that if you're separating, it retards competition. And that's going to lower productivity improvements, it's going to lower innovation and growth.Scott Miller: Plus, if this is done with precipitous government action, it increases both complexity and a lack of predictability, and makes the markets even more nervous.Andrew Schwartz: What does Wall Street want?Scott Miller: Well, more than anything else, predictability.Andrew Schwartz: And there's none here.Bill Reinsch: Yes, I think Scott ... They want to be left alone, but-Scott Miller: Yeah, but they're not going to get that.Bill Reinsch: It's a little late for that. But after, '09, I don't think that's going to happen. But I think an uncertainty is he's right. The predictability is the key point. Uncertainty is the, the bane of every financial person's [crosstalk 00:00:18:20].Scott Miller: Always, and it does great harm to prosperity in the long run. If you sustain an uncertain environment, you leave investment on the sidelines, you lose productivity growth, you lose innovation. And sooner or later you get poorer.Bill Reinsch: People sit on their money.Scott Miller: Right.Bill Reinsch: And if they're sitting on their money and they're not growing, they're not investing, in the long run it doesn't pay off for anybody. If they don't know what to do, or if they don't know if their investment this month in a Chinese company is going to be illegal two months from now. They wait.Andrew Schwartz: Finally, gentlemen, we cannot get through a podcast without talking about "USMCA". It's still back-a. And ... Yeah, I know.Bill Reinsch: You're going to run out of puns one of these weeks.Andrew Schwartz: I know, I know. But Scott got it started. "USMCA" is so great.Scott Miller: Yeah, it's all my fault.Andrew Schwartz: Both leader McConnell and leader McCarthy, Kevin McCarthy from the House, wrote an Op-Ed in the journal the other day. And basically they said the US ... They called for the USMCA to get done. They called on Democrats to put it through. And one of the things they said was USMCA would also help keep North American partners close, while the United States hangs tough with China. What do you think of that?Scott Miller: The Op-Ed was basically right. The timing of the Op-Ed was because the USMCA was signed a year ago. This has been sitting around for a year now.Bill Reinsch: Agreed to a year ago. They didn't sign it until December 1st.Scott Miller: That's right, it was agreed to. They notified that they were going to sign, but it's been a year. And this happens a lot when administrations deal with Congress, particularly one party unity all across the Hill and with the White House. So this is not unexpected. There's a lot of good work going on. On the negative side, Congress always winds up with a pile up of important issues at the end of the year. They're gone for two weeks now, that when they come back there's six weeks roughly speaking of session left. And there's a very long to-do-list. Now the positive, once the negotiations with the Ways and means committee are completed, as I understand it, there's really nothing left to do but vote. So of all the things this fall, which could cause distraction, if Chairman Neil and the working group reach agreement with the administration. At that point, they are basically saying we're ready for a bill. Once the bill's introduced it can't be amended. It's on a fixed timetable. So-Andrew Schwartz: And it's going to pass.Scott Miller: Well you might as well just vote on it, at that point.Andrew Schwartz: And so is it fair for the Republicans to be claiming that the Democrats have turned "USMCA" into a political football?Bill Reinsch: Well, no. I give the Democrats more credit than that. I think they're genuinely trying to get to, yes. The Republicans will always do this, because it divides the democratic party. There's people that are irreconcilably against any trade agreement.Scott Miller: Yeah. This is good politics for Republicans and tough politics for Democrats. So yeah.Bill Reinsch: I don't think there's been an undue delay, and I think Scott is exactly correct. Once there is a deal, if there is one, it'll all go very quickly, and I think this is going to be over with by Thanksgiving. I continue to think that.Andrew Schwartz: They'll vote and it'll be approved by Thanksgiving?Bill Reinsch: I think so.Andrew Schwartz: Then Canada will follow our lead and sign it? [crosstalk 00:21:27].Bill Reinsch: That's probably on their election.Scott Miller: Yes, but what the Republicans are indicating is they're not going to give up on this and they're not going to stop poking the Speaker to get on with it. This is a talking point that they're going to continue to use.Bill Reinsch: Yean they're vulnerable on it. First of all, it's a classic case of changing the subject. If you don't want to talk about impeachment, let's talk about something where we can point the finger to the Democrats.Scott Miller: Sure.Bill Reinsch: Of course the other problem that the Senate Republicans have to face, this is not a McCarthy issue, it's a McConnell issue. If you want to talk about the graveyard of legislation in the US Congress, it's the US Senate, the US House have past hundreds of bills and the Senate hasn't done anything with any of them.Scott Miller: I think there's a T-shirt available on the McConnell reelection campaign website that basically summarizes that point. The leader is quite proud of that fact.Bill Reinsch: Yes. When I moved from the Hill to the executive branch, one of the things that bothered me about the executive branch was that I thought it was full of people who go home, thinking they had a good day if they stopped something from happening. And that the mindset on the Hill was to finish. It was self-serving. You wanted to finish because you wanted to get the press release so you could take credit, but that seems to have changed now. McConnell thinks he has a good day if he stops something from happening.Scott Miller: Well look, we had several majority leaders of both parties who liked the House better than the Senate and tried to turn the Senate into the House. So we're down that path quite a ways. But at this point obstruction seems to be worth it for point scoring only. That was also true when you had a democratic president, a Republican House, and a Democratic leader in the form of Senator Reid a few years back.Bill Reinsch: I wish for the days when you could actually have a vote on something. I went to a reunion on Saturday, I went to a reunion of Senate Banking Committee staff. People that worked in the banking committee in the '80s and early '90s.Andrew Schwartz: That must've been a hootenanny.Bill Reinsch: It was much more fun than you would think. You say the word banking and people's eyes roll. But this was a good group and an interesting group. One of the comments that someone ... It was not a group discussion, but I was talking to one of them, and one of the comments that someone made in passing, one of the things they admired about Senator Proxmire who was chairman for a long time and mostly.Andrew Schwartz: William Proxmire.Bill Reinsch: Yeah, Wisconsin, most of that period was ... Proxmire's view was that you ought to let the committee vote. And even if he didn't have the votes, he would hold the meeting, and he would let them vote, because he thought that was the right thing to do.Scott Miller: Now this reunion-Bill Reinsch: And I think that was the right approach.Scott Miller: At the reunion they handed out T-shirts that said, "Get off my lawn."Andrew Schwartz: Gentlemen. As always, it is great fun chatting with you. Until next week, keep it real. Stay with the Trade Guys. We'll be back.Andrew Schwartz: To our listeners.

Blitzchung shouted "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age" in Chinese while wearing a gas mask during a post-match interview at a Blizzard-sponsored "Hearthstone" tournament in Taiwan on October 5.In the blog post announcing Blitzchung's ban, Blizzard said he had violated the rules of the competition by making statements that were harmful to the company.Read more: Blizzard is under scrutiny from lawmakers, gamers, and maybe even its own employees after punishing a 'Hearthstone' competitor who voiced his support for protesters in Hong KongHours after Blizzard announced Blitzchung's ban, a former Blizzard employee tweeted that some backlash seemed to be brewing internally: Someone had covered up two of the company's key values - "Think Globally" and "Every Voice Matters" - enshrined on a statue at the company's headquarters.A day later, a group of about 30 Blizzard employees gathered near the center of the the company's campus to protest the ban and show support for protesters in Hong Kong."The action Blizzard took against the player was pretty appalling but not surprising," one Blizzard employee told The Daily Beast. "Blizzard makes a lot of money in China, but now the company is in this awkward position where we can't abide by our values."The significance of the umbrella The original Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong began in 2014, when protesters took to the streets calling for universal suffrage. The protesters in Hong Kong began carrying umbrellas to guard against the use of pepper spray by riot police.Over the last four months, millions of people in Hong Kong have marched to demand sovereignty from mainland China and protest increasingly poor socioeconomic conditions. The ongoing protests have already garnered international attention, with the territory's increasingly complex relationship with China's communist government as a core issue.Even as Blizzard employees gathered in protest, "Hearthstone" commentator Brian Kibler announced that he would decline working with the company for the finals of its Grandmasters competition. Though Kibler agreed that Blitzchung had violated the company's policies, he said the punishment seemed too harsh for the situation."The heavy-handedness of it feels like someone insisted that Blizzard make an example of Blitzchung, not only to discourage others from similar acts in the future but also to appease those upset by the outburst itself," Kibler wrote. "That kind of appeasement is simply not something I can in good conscience be associated with."Blizzard's response has also garnered attention from US. lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. Both senators implied that Blizzard's decision was an act of censorship."Blizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party," Wyden tweeted. "No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck."NOW WATCH: 7 lesser-known benefits of Amazon PrimeSee Also:• 'Fortnite' creator says it won't punish players for speaking out about politics, as Blizzard faces backlash and calls for a boycott after banning competitor for supporting Hong Kong protests• Blizzard is under scrutiny from lawmakers, gamers, and maybe even its own employees after punishing a 'Hearthstone' competitor who voiced his support for protesters in Hong Kong• California-based game company Blizzard bans pro esports player and confiscates his prize money after he voices support for Hong Kong protestersSEE ALSO: Blizzard is under scrutiny from lawmakers, gamers, and maybe even its own employees after punishing a 'Hearthstone' competitor who voiced his support for protesters in Hong KongLoad-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

CSX will report this evening, followed by management's conference call at 16:30 ET, while Union-Pacific's report will be released tomorrow morning, followed by a conference call at 8:45 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects CSX to report a 2.9% yr/yr decrease in EPS to $1.02 on a 4.7% yr/yr decrease in revenue to $2.98 bln. The Capital IQ consensus expects Union-Pacific to report a 7.4% yr/yr increase in EPS to $2.31 on a 4.7% yr/yr decrease in revenue to $5.65 bln. Both rail carriers are among the 20 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Another DJTA component, J.B. Hunt Transportation Services (JBHT 114.99, +3.39, +3.0%) reported weaker than expected Q3 EPS yesterday, coupled with slightly better than expected revenue. CSX trades about 15% below its record high from May while UNP is about 10% below its own record from August. Like JBHT, CSX and UNP are likely to lament the current operating environment, considering weekly Rail Traffic reports from the Association of American Railroads have consistently pointed to yr/yr declines in traffic between 5% and 10%. September saw yr/yr carload decreases in 14 out of 20 commodity categories after 12 out of 20 commodity categories showed yr/yr declines in August. CSX was downgraded to Neutral at JPMorgan on October 4 while UNP was upgraded to Overweight at Atlantic Equities. UNP CFO reaffirmed the company's guidance for FY19 operating ratio below 61% on September 4. The CFO did note that the company now expects volume in the second half of 2019 to decline in the mid-single digits while previous guidance called for a decrease of about 2%.CSX trades at 15.8x forward earnings expectations while UNP trades at 16.9x forward estimates.11:38SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (49) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ACHN, ACM, ARNC, ASC, ATKR, BHE, BLD, BLDR, BMCH, BZH, CASH, CBPO, CCS, CELG, CHTR, CNS, DE, DEA, DLTR, DOCU, IBP, INFO, INXN, IRT, JBL, KBH, KN, KOD, KSU, LBRDK, LEN, LGIH, MAS, MDC, MTH, MTZ, NFBK, ODFL, PHM, RETA, SHW, SNX, TECD, TMCX, TMHC, TPH, VICI, WD, WMSStocks that traded to 52 week lows: DERM, DT, FLDM, GTYH, HEP, ICUI, LBRT, LNDC, PRQR, RVLV, SSTI, TACO, TEUM, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: DCOM, PDFSThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: BSTC, FULC, NGVC, NPK, RMNIETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWT, ITB, PALL, PSK, XHB11:35Events and Conferences TomorrowImage Sensors Auto Americas 2019 (Oct 17-18)Scheduled to appear: INFO, XLNX, LYFT, SNEPMA Fresh Summit Conference & Expo 2019 (Oct 17-19)Scheduled to appear: AGFSAmong company updates: Sanderson Farms (SAFM) investor day at 20:30 ET11:30DT Dynatrace (-4%): Recent IPO falls to record low as software stocks come under pressure following tepid Workday (WDAY -12%) Analyst Day (17.41 -0.79)11:28XLF Money Center Comparables- Morgan Stanley reports tomorrow before the market opensMorgan Stanley will report earnings tomorrow before the open with a conference call to follow at 8am ET.Current Capital IQ consensus stands at EPS of $1.12 (-4% yr/yr), Net Income at $1.80 bln (-10% yr/yr), on Revenues of $9.63 bln (-2% yr/yr).MS results will be compared to peers.

The two seem to be canceling each other out to a large extent, which is keeping the major indices in check.The outsized moves have been reserved for individual stocks with news, like Bank of America (BAC 30.45, +0.72, +2.4%) and United Airlines (UAL 90.08, +2.20, +2.5%), both of which reported better than expected earnings results. Accordingly, there hasn't been a lot of movement at the sector level.Seven sectors are up and four are down, with changes ranging from a 0.6% decline (information technology) to a 1.0% increase (materials).In terms of the macro hangups, they include the weaker-than-expected retail sales numbers for September, reports that a Brexit deal compromise between the EU and UK might not come to fruition before the Oct. 31 deadline, and misgivings about the completion of the "phase one" trade deal with China.The latter has stemmed from news that the U.S. House passed measures that support the Hong Kong protesters, which prompted a warning from China that it will respond with countermeasures if the U.S. Senate also passes those measures and the legislation ultimately becomes law.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are flat; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%.10:03VRRM Verra Mobility to acquire Pagatelia; terms not disclosed (13.99 -0.03)Pagatelia is a European leader in electronic tolling throughout Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy. Pagatelia's platform manages electronic tolling transactions from more than 500,000 devices. This acquisition enables Verra Mobility to accelerate its expansion of tolling solutions for rental car and fleet companies across Europe in a rapidly-growing global tolling market.

The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.09:07TWOU 2U appoints Paul S.

In Study 202 (Rx nave patients), greater mean log10 declines in HBV DNA (5.27 vs 3.99; p=0.017) and RNA (2.34 vs 0.61; p<0.001) were achieved with 731+Nrtl (entecavir) versus entecavir alone. In Study 201 (Nrtl-suppressed patients), the proportion of patients on 731+Nrtl versus Nrtl alone achieving DNA target not detected (TND) was 69% vs 0% (p<0.001), and the proportion of patients achieving RNA <35 U/mL whose RNA was less than 35 U/mL at baseline was 52% vs 0% (p=0.0013) respectively. In Study 211, there are 64 HBeAg+ patients currently on extended treatment beyond 24 weeks. Among the 27 HBeAg+ patients receiving 731+Nrtl in Study 201, 41% (11/27) have now achieved DNA TND along with RNA <35 U/mL and HBeAg <1 IU/mL. At their last timepoint, Study 202 patients now in Study 211 (n=22) have demonstrated mean DNA and RNA declines of 6.1 and 3.0 logs, respectively, with observed mean log changes of more than or equal to 0.6 for HBeAg (11 patients more than or equal to 0.5, 4 patients more than or equal to 1.0), >0.8 log for HBcrAg (7 patients more than or equal to 1.0, 3 patients more than or equal to 2.0) and more than or equal to 0.4 log for HBsAg (7 patients more than or equal to 0.5, 3 patients more than or equal to 1.0). 731 continues to exhibit a favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients treated for up to 1 year, with only mild/moderate adverse events and lab abnormalities, and only a single discontinuation due to a Grade 1 rash. The combination of 731+NrtI results in faster and deeper declines in HBV DNA and RNA than NrtI alone, as well as subsequent declines in the surrogate markers of cccDNA (pgRNA, HBeAg and HBcrAg) predictive of cccDNA pool depletion, and HBsAg. The emergent data supports the continued development of 731. ABI-H2158 -- The Second-Generation Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Core Inhibitor (CI) ABI-H2158 is Associated with Potent Antiviral Activity in a 14-Day Monotherapy Study in HBeAg-positive Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)Abstract Summary: The Phase 1b study is enrolling sequential cohorts of 9 patients and each cohort will be randomized to receive 2158 or placebo (7:2) QD for 14 days in a blinded manner. Dosing in the 1st cohort (100 mg) has been completed. In patients receiving 2158, mean declines from Baseline to Day 15 in HBV DNA and RNA levels were 2.3 log10 IU/mL [range 1.7 -- 3.0] and 2.1 log10 IU/mL [range 1.5 - 2.7] respectively. No serious AEs, dose limiting toxicities or premature discontinuations were reported. Three patients reported a total of 5 mild, drug-related AEs that recovered without intervention; dizziness, fatigue, rash, headache and upper abdominal pain. Treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities were infrequent, mild and transient, with no ALT elevations Grade more than or equal to 1 in severity. Day 14 plasma 2158 Cmax and AUC0-24hr were 3,390 ng/mL and 46,100 hr*ng/mL, respectively. Results from the initial 100 mg low dose of ABI-H2158 cohort demonstrated potent antiviral activity, a favorable safety profile when administered for 14 days, and support once daily dosing in CHB patients.07:43PAG Penske Auto increases quarterly dividend to $0.41/share from $0.40/share (45.08 )07:38ABT Abbott Labs reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q4 EPS in-line (81.98 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.84 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.84; revenues rose 5.5% year/year to $8.08 bln vs the $8.1 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus, and 7.6 percent on an organic basis including 3.8% in nutrition, 6.6% in diagnostics, 7.9% in established pharma and 10.6% in medical devices.

The legal action also seeks to reverse a related decision by CMS that imposed a prior authorization requirement for Auryxia when used for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult patients with CKD on dialysis.16:45RE Everest Re reports prelim Q3 pre-tax catastrophe loss estimate of $280 mln ($225 mln net of tax) (251.54 +0.93)These estimates specifically exclude any losses from Typhoon Hagibis which made landfall in Japan on October 12. The Everest estimated losses are based on a review of the Company's exposures, catastrophe models, best available information from customers and intermediaries, and industry insured loss estimates of approximately $8.5 billion for Dorian and $9 billion for Faxai. Given the recent date of the loss events, there is meaningful uncertainty as to the ultimate loss amounts.16:42SVM Silvercorp Metals reports results of exploration programs at LMW mine in China (3.70 -0.19)Silvercorp Metals reports the results of its exploration programs from April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 at the LMW mine, Ying Mining District, Henan Province, China.

This change in top line performance, coupled with lower factory absorption, higher operating expenses arising largely from acquisitions, and other factors, will adversely affect net income for the period. Thus, management expects that quarterly earnings per share are likely to be less than half of the [$0.23] consensus estimate and will provide conclusive data on that subject in its next earnings release."Focusing on full year 2019 results, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 6% year-over-year with mixed performance among our major markets. International sales should increase by about 27% for the full year. However, our domestic sales will likely decrease by about 5% on a per annum basis, which we believe is consistent with industry-wide forecasts showing domestic markets receding by 6% to 12%. With these considerations in mind, we are revising our full year 2019 net sales forecast downward to ~$480 million [from $500 mln vs. $499 mln consensus]. Other previously forecasted financial metrics relating to 2019 remain unchanged since our last earnings call."16:29LW Lamb Weston forms joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina (75.50 -0.34)Lamb Weston has formed a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina to serve the nearly 2-billion-pound South American market.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors.

Trump's top China adviser appears to have made up expert he regularly quotedCNN.comOctober 15, 2019 Tuesday 8:18 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 648 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Christine Romans, CNNBodyIn his 2011 book "Death by China," President Donald Trump's senior adviser Peter Navarro quoted a China hawk named "Ron Vara" to prove his point on the threat posed by Beijing to the American economy."Only the Chinese can turn a leather sofa into an acid bath, a baby crib into a lethal weapon, and a cell phone battery into heart-piercing shrapnel," Vara said. He appears once more in the book and is even referenced in the index.There's just one problem -- Vara doesn't appear to exist, according to an investigation by an Australian academic, who determined that Vara is actually Navarro. Ron Vara is even an anagram of Navarro's last name.Vara's true identity was revealed by Australian academic Tessa Morris-Suzuki, a professor emeritus of Japanese history at the Australian National University. She told CNN that she tried to find Vara after being asked to write an article on anti-China rhetoric for a local politics and foreign affairs blog."I just looked him up online, assuming he might be some businessman or other, and then he wasn't there. The more I looked, the more I thought this was really strange," she said."Then I realized the anagram."The Chronicle of Higher Education first reported Morris-Suzuki's investigation.The White House did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. In a statement to The Chronicle, which was later provided to CNN, Navarro had admitted to inventing the character of Ron Vara, describing it as a "whimsical device and pen name," purely for "entertainment value."He added that it was "refreshing that somebody finally figured out an inside joke that has been hiding in plain sight for years."Navarro, an academic, has been one of Trump's top advisers on trade matters since the 2016 campaign.The longtime China hawk is considered among the architects of the Trump administration's trade war with Beijing and has been regularly part of the US delegation sent to negotiate a potential deal with the Chinese government.Navarro has strongly defended Trump's tariffs on China, saying that they're needed to at least partially separate the two economies. He has repeatedly accused Beijing of currency manipulation, intellectual property theft and inflicting severe damage on the US manufacturing industry."China wants to buckle our knees so that they can have their way with us," Navarro told CNN in August.Before he joined the Trump administration, he was a prolific author and Morris-Suzuki said that Ron Vara is regularly featured throughout Navarro's books. He appears in Navarro's 2001 "If It's Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks," described as a stock trader "in a league of his own.""In fact, this Dark Prince of Disaster has made a very large fortune making the very best out of very bad situations," the book says.According to the 2001 book, Vara was a captain in a reserve unit during the Gulf War as well as a doctoral student in economics at Harvard University in the US.When Morris-Suzuki called Harvard, they said they didn't have any record of any alumni with that name.The academic said as she read through Navarro's books, the most recent of which have focused heavily on China, Ron Vara began to express increasingly anti-Beijing views in his works."Initially (Vara's remarks) are pretty anodyne little quotes, little bits of wisdom as it were, but when he gets into writing his China books we get these ferocious anti-China quotes," she said.Vara is quoted in at least six of Navarro's books, including in "The Coming China Wars" from 2008."You've got to be nuts to eat Chinese food," Vara is quoted as saying.Morris-Suzuki said that she found Navarro's attitude to his misquoting of analysts "concerning.""They were popular books, they were certainly supposed to be facts and in a sense he's staked his reputation as a China expert on these books, so quoting from a made-up person in those seems like a strange thing to do," she said.Load-Date: October 18, 2019End of Document

NBA's response to China backlash at odds with league's historyCNN WireOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 11:32 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 751 wordsByline: Analysis by Brandon Tensley, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  How much of its integrity -- and legacy -- is the National Basketball Association willing to sacrifice for the sake of business? The answer, apparently, is: lots.Over the weekend, the Houston Rockets barreled into an international imbroglio when the team's general manager, Daryl Morey, posted a message on Twitter that read, "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong," referring to escalating protests that, over the past few months, have put the former British colony on a collision course with the Chinese government.The backlash was swift. Several Chinese businesses and the Chinese Basketball Association announced that they're suspending cooperation with the Rockets. NBA preseason games won't be broadcast or streamed in China after CCTV's sports channel announced Tuesday it was halting those broadcasts and Tencent, the NBA's exclusive digital partner in China, also said it would suspend live streaming for the preseason games.More troubling, though, has been the tenor of the responses from some of the NBA's top brass and most fêted players."@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization," Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta tweeted on Friday."We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable," league spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement on Sunday. (Notably, he also nodded to the league's support of players who "(share) their views on matters important to them.")"We apologize. We love China. We love playing there," Rockets star James Harden said on Monday. "They show us the most important love, so we appreciate them as a fan base."What's remarkable about these statements, especially those from Harden, is how they're decidedly at odds with the ethos of the NBA. As The New York Times culture reporter Sopan Deb tweeted on Sunday, "The NBA has long branded itself as the 'League That Encourages Political Activism.' And now, the league is silent on the attacks on Morey."Indeed, the NBA's general jumpiness around upsetting its relationship with China -- veiled by its gormless insistence that it's an apolitical organization -- is a betrayal of its own history of activism, one pioneered significantly by the league's black players.To see how, rewind some half a century. In the 1960s and '70s, the basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had a famed professional career first with the Milwaukee Bucks and then with the Los Angeles Lakers, was one of the most visible and socially conscious athletes in the sporting world, often taking America to task on issues of racial inequality (the country, of course, didn't like that too much)."The poor people of Harlem felt that it was better to get hit with a nightstick than to keep on taking the white man's insults forever. Right then and there I knew who I was and who I had to be. I was going to be black rage personified, black power in the flesh," Abdul-Jabbar recalled to Sports Illustrated in 1980, of the influence the 1964 Harlem race riots had on him.As the sports journalist Howard Bryant argues in his 2018 book, "The Heritage: Black Athletes, a Divided America, and the Politics of Patriotism," Abdul-Jabbar was part of a much broader generation of black athlete-activists -- including the 12-time NBA All-Star Bill Russell -- who revealed how, at least for some players, the game has always had a political dimension.But you don't have to go back even that far to see how much the recent comments being batted around the NBA smother and squelch history. LeBron James, for one, is a present-day avatar of the athlete-activist. He has a record of advocating for greater awareness of a variety of political and social-justice issues: police violence, education, compensation for student athletes (predictably, this has made him a frequent target of the American right).All of which is to say that the NBA has more at stake than its Chinese fortune. While the unfolding events are somewhat different in scope than the aforementioned examples, they all speak to the league's broader reputation, one that its black players, in particular, have helped to build and sustain over the decades. The question now is: What governs the NBA -- its hard-won values or the financial pressure of an autocratic regime?TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Despite $6.1 Billion in Funding, China Not Leading in AI Innovation; Lux Research Evaluates China's Position to Overtake the U.S. in Artificial IntelligencePR NewswireSeptember 19, 2019 Thursday 6:11 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 642 wordsDateline: BOSTON, Sept. 19, 2019 BodyPR NewswireOver the past four years, Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startups have received $6.1 billion in funding. However, despite immense amounts of investment and being second only to the U.S. in number of companies focusing on AI, China is not leading in cutting-edge AI innovation. To better understand the progress of AI in China, the team at Lux Research, a leading provider of tech-enabled research and advisory services for technology innovation, took a deep dive into China's AI patents, research papers, venture capital (VC) funding, and other innovation data in their new report,"Will China Take Over the Global AI Industry?"The new report analyzes the total number of AI-related VC funding, patents, and research papers in five major AI technology areas: fundamental AI, natural language processing (NLP), voice recognition, computer vision, and AI processors and edge computing."On the surface, all innovation-related data indicate that China is poised to take over the world. Diving deeper, we find that all the hype around AI in China is warranted; however, it only highlights a few platform technologies and market segments," said Jerrold Wang, Analyst at Lux Research and lead author of thereport.Chinese AI startups received $6.1 billion in VC funding over the past four years - almost 70% more than their U.S. counterparts, which raised $3.6 billion during the same period. The numbers dwarfed the amount of VC funding in other Asian countries, such as Japan, India, and South Korea. Although funding data make China appear to be a global leader in AI, the funding raised by Chinese AI startups is significantly concentrated in the technologies of computer vision and natural language processing.Additionally, "China has published more AI-related patents and papers than any other country in the world." Wang noted that although China leads in volume of patents and papers, deeper analysis indicates that it is still not leading the world when it comes to developing truly innovative technologies.Having focused only on technologies like computer vision, voice recognition, and NLP, as well as only a few market segments, such as finance, retail, and government, Chinese companies have seen rapid business growth in the domestic market, but they are having difficulty entering into the Western market.Wang goes on to explain that "Chinese AI companies will struggle to penetrate U.S. and European markets because they lack clear technology advantage over the leading local peers and their expertise in covering some Chinese market segments cannot be leveraged to cover the foreign marketLux's "Will China Take Over the Global AI Industry?" report provides in-depth data and insights that uncover China's strengths and weaknesses as related to AI, including findings and opportunities by market and type of company.For more information,download the executive summary.About Lux Research Lux Research is a leading provider of tech-enabled research and advisory services, helping clients drive growth through technology innovation.

(AP) - As political tensions flare back home, Hong Kong students on U.S. college campuses say they have been ostracized and in some cases threatened by fellow students from mainland China, and they suspect they are being watched from afar by Beijing.Some say they see the hand of the Chinese government working in ways that threaten academic freedom."Even though many Chinese students are studying right here, sometimes they are all being monitored. They're not really free of their minds and expression in this country," said Hong Kong democracy activist Nathan Law, a 26-year-old graduate student in Asian studies at Yale University.Law said he was told by a fellow student that other Chinese at the Ivy League school are avoiding contact with him for fear it will be reported back to the Chinese Embassy and they or their families back home will face consequences."There will be staring, spotting me and discussing among themselves, and pointing at me in an unfriendly manner," said Law, whose continuing political work has included visits to Washington to meet with members of Congress.Hong Kong has been beset with huge pro-democracy demonstrations since June that have triggered clashes with riot police in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory and stirred fears of a violent crackdown from Beijing.Over 360,000 students from mainland China attended U.S. colleges and universities in the 2017-18 school year, compared with about 7,000 from Hong Kong, according to the Institute of International Education.At Emerson College in Boston, student Frances Hui, of Hong Kong, faced threatening language from classmates from mainland China after she published a column in the student newspaper headlined "I am from Hong Kong, not China."She said she was unnerved by comments online by people who said they had seen her on campus and described her as short, which made her feel as if she were under surveillance. And she panicked when an Emerson student posted her column on Facebook along with a comment that any opponents of China "must be executed."Hui, 20, said she alerted the Emerson administration.Emerson spokeswoman Sofiya Cabalquinto said the college supports "the rights of our students' voicing their opinions and doing so free from threats." She said the college put a plan in place to address Hui's concerns, but she would not say whether disciplinary action was taken against the student who made the online post.Law gained prominence as a student protest leader before winning election to Hong Kong's legislature in 2016 but was later expelled as a member and jailed for several months for his activism.He said he started getting death threats of unknown origin online soon after he arrived in August, including warnings that people with guns would go looking for him at Yale and suggestions that Chinese students in the U.S. assault him. He said he was also subjected to insults echoing a Chinese Communist Party campaign labeling him a criminal.He reported the threats to police and the Yale administration. He said the harassment has subsided since Yale police began monitoring the online threats.He said he hasn't faced anything so overt from Yale students, although he said people have circulated his information in a group for Chinese students at Yale on WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, and urged people to say "hi" to him _ a gesture he saw as vaguely threatening.A Yale spokeswoman, Karen Peart, said only that the university police department takes appropriate action whenever a campus community member faces an unsafe situation.A report this year by Human Rights Watch said Chinese students at times remain silent in their classrooms out of fear their comments will be reported to Chinese authorities by other students. The organization described the monitoring as one of several ways the Chinese government undermines academic freedom on foreign campuses."Schools need to get very clear about these problems and they need to get policies to respond to them," said Sophie Richardson, Human Rights Watch's China director.At universities in Australia and New Zealand, students on either side of the political divide have built up and torn down displays advocating autonomy for Hong Kong.And there have been signs of tensions at other U.S. campuses, including Georgetown University in Washington, which has seen dueling chalk messages on the Hong Kong protests, and Columbia University in New York, where Hong Kong democracy advocates were greeted last month by protesters holding China's flag at a lecture hall where they were giving a talk.Load-Date: October 3, 2019End of Document

China Cold Chain Logistics Industry Report, 2019-2025PR NewswireOctober 21, 2019 Monday 8:05 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 575 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Oct. 21, 2019 BodyPR NewswireCold chain logistics is developing apace in China as cold chain for food is increasingly needed due to the accelerating process of urbanization and the changes in residents' diet structure, whilst local Chinese governments are sparing no efforts in constructing cold chain infrastructure.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p0694456/?utm_source=PRNChinese cold chain logistics market was worth RMB295.6 billion in 2018 with an upsurge of 18.8% from a year earlier, and it will keep expanding and soar to RMB522.5 billion in 2025 with an expected CAGR of 8.5% between 2018 and 2025 as the cold chain standards and policy grow clear, the fresh food e-commerce burgeons and financial innovations continue.Robust demand for cold chain logistics comes largely from five agricultural products including meat, aquatic product, quick-frozen food, fruits & vegetables, and dairy products, among which cold chain for fruits and vegetables is the segment of the largest size; there is also a rapidly growing demand for cold chain for aquatic products. The two types of products will hold ever larger market shares with maturity of cold chain technologies. What's more, cold chain for medicine is gathering momentum, particularly for vaccines, blood products and diagnostic reagents.Competition in cold chain logistics:Logistics operation: most players are engaged in both cold storage operation and cold chain transportation, like Xianyi Holding, Swire Cold Chain Logistics, and ZM Logistics. Not only have they huge cold storage capacity, but their transportation power is quite competitive.Cold storage operation: Chinese cold storage market is scattered with a low concentration ratio and with strong regional attributes. In 2018, the top 10 cold storage operators had a total cold storage capacity of 30.89 million, commanding roughly 21.0% market shares, and the typical ones like Xianyi Supply Chain, Swire Cold Chain Logistics, and China Merchants Americold, all of which boast large cold storage network across China.China Cold Chain Logistics Industry Report, 2019-2025 highlights the following:Overview of cold chain logistics industry (definition, classification, composition structure, industrial chain, market features, business model, policies, etc.);Chinese cold chain logistics market (market size, market demand, competitive landscape, market structure, development prospects and development in key regions in the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region);Cold chain market segments including fruits & vegetables, meat, quick-frozen rice and flour products, aquatic products, dairy products, and medicine (market features, demand, etc.);Cold storage market (overview, overall capacity, regional analysis, competitive pattern and predictions);22 Cold chain operators (profile, performance, revenue structure, cold chain business, development strategy, etc.)Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p0694456/?utm_source=PRNAboutReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Organic growth in the quarter amounted to +6%, driving 180 basis points of improvement in adj. operating margins yr/yr. Reached new highs. ERIC (9.09 +5.57%): Reported Q3 results; revs rose +6.2% yr/yr to SEK 57.13 b., approximately in-line with consensus; sales adjusted for comparable units and currency increased +3%, driven by growth in North America and North East Asia. Operating income was impacted by cost provisions of SEK -11.5 b. related to a resolution of certain investigations in the US. Raised its 2020 sales target to SEK 230-240 b.(prior SEK 210-220 b.) and raised its operating margin target for 2022. ROKU (139.4 +5.21%): Continued strength on high volume; the stock now trades at its new highest levels in approx. one month.Large Cap LosersIBM (134.51 -5.35%): Reported Q3 results; co missed consensus on revs (fell 3.9% yr/yr to $18.03 bln) on upside EPS. Reaffirmed FY19 EPS guidance. By segment, revs increased for Cloud & Cognitive Software (+6.4%) and Global Business Services (+1.0%) but declined for Global Technology Services (down 5.6%), Systems (down 14.7%), and Global Financing (down 11.7%) during the quarter. Price target cut at various firms, including Wedbush (to $155 from $165) and Wells Fargo (to $140 from $147). At multi-week lows. TXT (47.99 -4.92%): In its Q3 report, co topped consensus for EPS while missing on revs (+1.8% yr/yr to $3.26 bln); narrowed its FY19 EPS target in-line. Lower defense volume partially offset revenue growth in co's Textron Aviation segment while lower military volume partially offset revenue growth in co's Bell segment. MTB (152.54 -4.02%): Missed consensus for Q3 EPS. Net interest margin was 3.78% vs 3.88% in the prior year quarter. Higher operating expenses in the quarter, noted co, reflected investments in mortgage banking and technology.15:18SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Pool Corporation (POOL) gains following third quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersTEVA (7.57 +8.92%): Continued volatility alongside drug manufacturer peers; the stock was upgraded to Buy at Gabelli & Co today, citing potential signs of momentum for global opioid settlement agreements. We noted action in co's Dec 6 puts earlier this afternoon (see 10/17 14:26 OPTNX).POOL (218.36 +8.78%): Topped consensus for Q3 EPS and revs (+10.7% yr/yr to $898.5 mln).

Raised its FY19 EPS guidance above consensus. At all-time highs. TTM (9.72 +8.67%): Indian stocks generally outperform -- the iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA) advances circa +1.4% -- with co showing notable leadership relative to peers and reaching its highest levels since July; reports of a draft Brexit deal may provide fuel for today's move, particularly given co's exposure to the UK via its Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary.Mid Cap LosersIGT (13.44 -6.41%): Sees volatility on above average volume. In recent items, co appeared at the G2E Global Gaming Expo this week; the stock saw volatility on higher than average volume on Tuesday and touched down then to new one-month lows. Today's action saw the stock record one-month highs before dropping back toward those recent lows. EWBC (41.39 -5.07%): Missed consensus for Q3 EPS on in-line revs (+6.6% yr/yr to $421.28 mln). The provision for credit losses increased to $38 mln for the quarter (from $19.2 mln in Q2 and $10.5 mln in the year ago period), and co's pre-tax income declined by 7.5% sequentially. SDC (9.51 -4.9%): Continued volatility; recorded new lows following a critical mention by Hindenburg Research.15:13BONDX Treasury Market Summary2-yr Note Paces Shallow DipU.S. Treasuries ended Thursday near their flat lines after recovering from their morning lows. Treasuries started the cash session with modest losses after the futures market saw some selling, which took place after it was announced that a revised Brexit deal has been reached. However, the optimism about the deal was guarded, since it remains unclear if the agreement will receive enough support in the British parliament. Treasuries widened their opening losses during the first hour of the session, but the selling pressure abated once the 10-yr note approached its session low from Tuesday. That dip took place despite the release of mostly underwhelming economic data, but mid-morning trade saw a rally to fresh highs. However, like the opening retreat, the rebound was modest in scope, pausing just below yesterday's intraday high. Another slow pullback took place in the afternoon, pressuring all tenors back into negative territory just before the close. The U.S. Dollar Index recorded its third consecutive decline, falling 0.4% to 97.62. Yield Check: 2-yr: +2 bps to 1.61% 3-yr: +1 bp to 1.58% 5-yr: +1 bp to 1.58% 10-yr: +1 bp to 1.76% 30-yr: +1 bp to 2.24%News: Bloomberg reported that the latest report from the International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers showed that 68% of fund managers expect an increase in defaults. Turkey agreed to halt its military operations in Northern Syria for five days to allow YPG forces to evacuate the region after Vice President, Mike Pence, met with Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Ankara. China's Ministry of Commerce spokesman, Gao Feng, delivered his regular press conference, but did not say anything new regarding negotiations with the U.S. China's agriculture ministry reported that large hog inventories increased 0.6% m/m in September, claiming that inventories at large farms have bottomed and are now rebounding. Chinese officials will now be required to notify the U.S. State Department ahead of planned meetings with U.S. government officials, educators, and researchers. Australia's September Employment Change totaled 14,700 (expected 15,300; last 34,700) while full employment increased by 26,200 (last -15,200). September Participation Rate ticked down to 66.1% (expected 66.2%) from 66.2% and the Unemployment Rate dipped to 5.2% (expected 5.3%) from 5.3%. Eurozone's August Construction Output decreased 0.46% m/m (last -0.18%). U.K.'s September Retail Sales were unchanged m/m (expected 0.1%; last -0.3%) while core Retail Sales increased 0.2% m/m (expected -0.1%; last -0.3%). Today's Data: Total housing starts declined a disappointing 9.4% m/m in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.306 million). Building permits declined 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.387 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.350 million). The key takeaway from the Housing Starts and Building Permits report is that the month-over-month weakness was a function of downturns for multi-unit dwellings. Single-family starts were up 0.3% to 918,000 while single-family permits were up 0.8% to 882,000. Initial claims for the week ending October 12 increased by 4,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 5 decreased by 10,000 to 1.679 million. The key takeaway from the initial claims report is that it bodes well for another solid increase in October nonfarm payrolls, as this report covers the period in which the survey for the October employment report was conducted. The Philadelphia Fed Survey decreased to 5.6 in October (Briefing.com consensus 6.0) from 12.0 in September. Industrial production declined 0.4% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus -0.3%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 0.6%) in August. Total capacity utilization dropped to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.7%) from 77.9% in August. The key takeaway from the report is that the weakness was unduly influenced by the strike at General Motors (GM), which contributed to a 0.7% decline in the manufacturing output for durables. Commodities: WTI crude: +1.0% to $53.89/bbl Gold: +0.3% to $1498.20/ozt Copper: +0.4% to $2.598/lb Currencies: EUR/USD: +0.5% to 1.1125 GBP/USD: +0.5% to 1.2875 USD/CNH: -0.3% to 7.0792 USD/JPY: -0.1% to 108.66 The Day Ahead: 10:00 ET: September Leading Inventories (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%; prior 0.0%)15:04XHB Industry Briefing: Homebuilders are moving higher today on strong housing data, especially in the South regionHomebuilders are trading higher today thanks to some positive housing data over the past couple of days. This morning, Census Bureau data showed that September Building Permits, at 1387K, came in above the Briefing.com consensus of 1350K. That's being viewed as particularly positive as permits are more of a leading indicator so that bodes well for future months.September Housing Starts were a bit light at 1256K vs 1306K Briefing.com consensus. However, the weakness was more on the multi-unit (2+ units) side as they dropped -28.2% month/month. Single-family starts ticked higher by +0.3%, which is good for homebuilders. And to drill a bit deeper, the South region led the way by a good margin for single-family starts at +7.1% whereas all other regions were negative. This is important because the South region is by far the largest region.Key Movers Today: MHO +3.6%, WLH +3%, TPH +2.6%, KBH +1.7%, TMHC +1.4%, NVR +1.3%.A couple of homebuilders with exposure to the southern US include:LGI Homes (LGIH) focuses on entry level homes. It's based just outside Houston and has a lot of exposure to the Texas market. Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) is based in Arizona. It builds homes from coast to coast, but has a good amount of exposure to the South and Texas via its Darling Homes segment.14:53XLI Sector Briefing: Industrials (77.79 +0.56)From a sector standpoint, there aren't any major standouts in today's trading action. Most sectors are up, but only one sector -- health care (+1.0%) -- is up at least 1.0%. One of the other leading sectors is the industrials sector (+0.8%).The relative strength among the industrials is owed in general to improved sentiment regarding the global growth outlook and specifically to positive moves made by several components following their earnings reports:Honeywell (HON 168.72, +5.09, +3.1%) beat Q3 earnings estimates and raised the low end of its FY19 adjusted EPS guidance range.Dover (DOV 101.22, +5.40, +5.6%) beat Q3 earnings and revenue estimates and narrowed its FY19 adjusted EPS guidance to the upper end of its prior guidance range.CSX Corp. (CSX 70.15, +1.15, +1.7%) exceeded the Q3 consensus EPS estimate, but industry peer Union Pacific (UNP 164.10, +0.79, +0.5%) came up short of expectations. Both railroad operators, however, impressed with their operating ratios.United Rentals (URI 127.83, +6.16, +5.1%) surpassed Q3 earnings and revenue estimates and provided a narrowed FY19 revenue guidance range that was slightly higher than the consensus estimate at the midpoint.Overall gains for the sector have been held in check, however, by weakness in Boeing (BA 370.02, -2.41, -0.7%), which follows news from Southwest (LUV 53.90, +0.23, +0.4%) that it's removing the 737 MAX from its flight schedule at least through February 8, and weakness in the defense stocks after Textron (TXT 48.13, -2.34, -4.6%) posted better-than-expected earnings results for the third quarter but noted that it saw lower defense volume for its Aviation segment and lower military volume for its Bell segment.14:31COMDX Energy Settlement PricesNov Crude Oil futures rose $0.34 (0.64%) to $53.76/barrel Nov Natural Gas closed flat at $2.32/MMBtu Nov RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 lower (-0.61%) at $1.62/gallon Nov Heating oil futures settled flat at $1.93/gallon14:26OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AXP Oct 120 calls (volume: 3910, open int: 390, implied vol: ~60%, prev day implied vol: 47%).

In fact, the company has exceeded EPS and revenue estimates for fifteen straight quarters.Additionally, its top-line growth has remained very consistent, ranging from 35-45% during this stretch.The steady results are impressive and have helped protect it from the onslaught that has buried many expensive cloud software stocks.While TEAM has shed 17% from its highs reached in August, names like Twilio (TWLO), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Zoom Video (ZM), and Workday (WDAY) have suffered larger losses. Since early August, those stocks are down 27%, 42%, 24%, and 20%, respectively.It is worth noting, though, that TEAM does have a history of issuing conservative guidance. It also has a history of barely edging out those quarterly expectations.For instance, for 3Q19 it issued inline EPS guidance and for 4Q19 it issued downside EPS guidance. On both occasions, TEAM's revenue guidance was slightly ahead of forecasts.Furthermore, the degree of its earnings beats has averaged a modest $0.02/share over the past eight quarters. With a 1-year forward P/S of ~15.5x, the margin for error is slim so even a slight deviation from these small beats could have a meaningful impact on the stock.1Q20 Expectations: Last quarter (4Q19), TEAM provided upside 1Q20 EPS guidance of $0.24 vs. the $0.21 consensus with revenue of $349-$353 mln compared to the $349.6 mln estimate.Despite TEAM's long track record of beating its own guidance, analysts' estimates match TEAM's outlook at EPS of $0.24 and revenue of $352 mln.Key Metrics: Unlike many cloud software companies, TEAM doesn't disclose many operating metrics, such as annual recurring revenue, retention rate, or large customer additions. Also unlike many cloud software companies, TEAM doesn't heavily focus on billings because it doesn't enter into many multi-year contracts.Operating margin is one metric that TEAM does highlight, though. Last quarter, Non-GAAP operating margin slipped 300 bps yr/yr to 17.0%. For this quarter, TEAM guided for operating margin of (3.0)%.Guidance: In the earnings press release, TEAM will likely provide EPS and revenue guidance for 2Q20. In order to meet expectations, it will need to guide for EPS of $0.26 and revenue of $381.5 mln.13:52COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $5.30 (0.36%) at $1497.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.18 higher (1.03%) at $17.6/oz Dec copper settled $0.01 higher (0.39%) at $2.6/lb13:21HMHC Houghton Mifflin Harcourt sees Q3 revs below consensus, raises FY 19 billings outlook, and announces 'workforce reductions' (4.89 -0.13)For the fiscal third quarter, the Company expects to report(1) net sales of $563 million vs $596 mln consensusThird quarter billings are expected to be $746 million, representing record growth of 30%, driven by expected Core Solutions billings growth of 50%, and expected Extensions billings growth of 25% compared to Q3'18HMH today updated its 2019 full year outlook to include its expectation of free cash flow in a range of $100 million to $120 million. Also, in light of its strong year-to-date financial performance, HMH revised its full year 2019 billings guidance range, which was previously $1,530 million to $1,610 million, to $1,590 million to $1,620 million with content development spend expected to be between $100 to $110 million and total capital expenditures to be between $150 and $160 million. The co also announced actions that are creating new product development and go-to-market capabilities, as well as the streamlining of operations company-wide for greater efficiency. These actions are expected to result in the elimination of 8% of HMH's workforce, after taking into account new strategy-aligned positions that are expected to be added and additional operating and capitalized cost reductions, including a redesigned product development model that is expected to result in approximately 20% less content development expenditures than previously planned over the next three years starting in 2020.13:02FIT Fitbit jumps 6% after announcing collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance (3.98 +0.24)The Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance and Fitbit today announced at the TIME 100 Health Summit in New York that they are working together to help drive timely diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with the aim of improving earlier detection in individuals at increased risk of stroke. The BMS-Pfizer Alliance and Fitbit plan to collaborate on the development of educational content and guidance to support people at increased risk for AFib. Upon submission and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the AFib detection software on Fitbit devices, the parties will aim to provide users with appropriate information to help encourage and inform discussions with their physicians.12:59WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks up but off session highs; S&P 500 near 3000 levelA strong start for the major averages has lost some steam, leaving the S&P 500 (+0.3%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) with modest gains. Weakness in IBM (IBM 133.35, -8.76, -6.2%) after a revenue miss is weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch) and S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.4%).The broader market remains slightly higher, though, thanks to relative strength in the S&P 500 health care (+0.9%), real estate (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.7%) sectors. Positive reactions to earnings reports from Honeywell (HON 167.99, +4.34, +2.7%), CSX (CSX 70.21, +1.22, +1.8%), and Union Pacific (UNP 165.48, +2.17, +1.3%) are supporting the industrials sector.As for health care, the group appears to be benefiting from a view that opioid litigation could be settled for a total package of $50 billion, according to Reuters. Companies involved in the offer include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 137.13, +1.96, +1.5%), Teva Pharma (TEVA 7.43, +0.48, +7.0%), McKesson (MCK 150.58, +5.76, +3.9%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.01, +1.94, +4.0%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.12, +3.08, +3.6%).Some cautious views on Brexit and a U.S.-China trade deal, meanwhile, may be restraining some buying conviction. A draft Brexit deal was announced, but some parties have already expressed their disapproval in front of a key vote this weekend. Separately, a report out of China reminded investors that Beijing wants all tariffs removed in order to end trade tensions.Isolated earnings reactions belong to Netflix (NFLX 298.10, +11.82, +4.1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS 43.83, +1.03, +2.4%). Netflix provided results that are being construed as better than feared, while Morgan Stanley beat top and bottom-line estimates.U.S. Treasuries have been on a steady rebound from overnight lows, leaving yields slightly lower. Germany lowering its 2020 growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.5% may have increased demand. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down two basis points to 1.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 97.58.Reviewing today's economic data:Total housing starts declined a disappointing 9.4% m/m in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.306 million). Building permits declined 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.387 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.350 million).The key takeaway from the Housing Starts and Building Permits report is that the month-over-month weakness was a function of downturns for multi-unit dwellings. Single-family starts were up 0.3% to 918,000 while single-family permits were up 0.8% to 882,000.Initial claims for the week ending October 12 increased by 4,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 5 decreased by 10,000 to 1.679 million.The key takeaway from the initial claims report is that it bodes well for another solid increase in October nonfarm payrolls, as this report covers the period in which the survey for the October employment report was conducted.Industrial production declined 0.4% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus -0.3%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 0.6%) in August. Total capacity utilization dropped to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.7%) from 77.9% in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the weakness was unduly influenced by the strike at General Motors (GM), which contributed to a 0.7% decline in the manufacturing output for durables.The Philadelphia Fed Index for October checked in at 5.6 (Briefing.com consensus 6.0) versus 12.0 in September.12:44SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: CRON (35.22 mln +2.44%), TEVA (28.24 mln +7.63%), ENDP (20.57 mln +16.35%), ACB (12.95 mln +5.12%)Materials: X (21.54 mln +0.47%)Industrials: GE (16.07 mln +1.69%)Consumer Discretionary: F (14.83 mln +0.06%), NIO (12.97 mln -0.34%), ROKU (12.14 mln +4.06%)Information Technology: NOK (24.93 mln +1.28%), AMD (24.19 mln +0.52%), INFY (23.96 mln -0.47%), ERIC (14.06 mln +4.59%), MSFT (11.01 mln -0.68%)Financials: BAC (32.3 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (32.87 mln -1.53%), MDR (11.41 mln +6.6%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: ASMB (9.46x +39.91%), CRON (8.51x +2.44%), NTRA (3.21x +3.9%), RCUS (2.2x +4.56%), ENDP (2.1x +16.35%), KNSA (2.05x -4.92%)Materials: CCK (2.97x +6.86%), LOMA (2.11x +5.57%)Industrials: URI (2.56x +0.85%), GTLS (1.94x +1.56%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (5.1x -46.13%)Information Technology: WNS (3.89x +6.4%), IBM (3.26x -6.32%), PAGS (3.23x +0.76%), ERIC (2.5x +4.59%)Consumer Staples: UN (3.19x +1.39%)12:43SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ASMB (17.79 +39.91%), ENDP (4.84 +16.35%), CLVS (3.61 +12.66%), MNK (2.48 +10.71%), TEVA (7.48 +7.63%), DPLO (5.16 +7.28%)Materials: CCK (67.89 +6.86%), HL (1.99 +6.72%), NGD (0.98 +6.62%), AA (20.35 +6.21%)Consumer Discretionary: TTM (9.78 +9.34%), POOL (216.91 +8.06%)Information Technology: FIT (3.98 +6.51%), WNS (64.38 +6.4%)Energy: REI (1.8 +9.09%), MDR (2.51 +6.6%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: AKCA (18.07 -7.66%), INO (2.34 -6.61%), ABEO (2.3 -5.54%), KNSA (5.32 -4.92%)Industrials: TXT (47.85 -5.19%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (0.6 -46.13%), IGT (13.6 -5.29%), BZUN (42.26 -5.24%), FNKO (18.13 -3.95%)Information Technology: IBM (133.13 -6.32%)Financials: MTB (151.24 -4.84%), EWBC (41.57 -4.66%), UMPQ (15.35 -3.88%)Energy: XOG (2.27 -9.56%), SPN (0.42 -9.21%), NBR (1.72 -6.01%), ESV (5.34 -4.86%), GTE (1.07 -4.05%)Consumer Staples: NBEV (2.86 -7%)12:27RHHBY Roche Hldg receives FDA approval for Xofluza sNDA for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza (36.42 +0.68)12:18SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Syros Pharmaceuticals (SYRS) sinks after discontinuing SY-1365 development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersASMB (17.4 +36.85%): The stock, currently trading with circa 10x average volume, sees a notable extension of yesterday's strength; it advanced on Wednesday after announcing that data for its lead HBV core inhibitor candidates, ABI-H0731 and ABI-H2158, for the treatment of chronic HBV will be featured in a late-breaking poster session during the AASLD Annual Meeting in November.

Co notes that SY-5609 demonstrated greater anti-tumor activity than did SY-1365 in multiple preclinical models and that SY-1365 "did not support an optimal profile for patients" in initial data from the expansion of the Phase 1 trial of SY-1365. Co identifies SY-5609 as the more selective and more potent CDK7 inhibitor and believes that it has "best-in-class potential." At three-month lows.XOG (2.28 -9.36%): Downgraded to Underperform from Outperform and price target cut to $2 from $7 at Imperial Capital, citing expectations for flat Q3 production levels, owing to unplanned outages in co's Western Gas system and startup delays for the Rimrock system, and noting fundamental riskiness in co's business model relative to DJ Basin peers, among other factors.

At the Barclays conference on September 10, AXP laid out the reasoning behind its wider than usual range for EPS guidance. That was due to the uncertainty in the economic environment. Comments at Barclays suggested AXP would see the middle of that range. So analysts are expecting company to tighten the outlook. The midpoint will be key with current Capital IQ consensus sitting at $8.10. The primary weakness for AXP is around its commercial end which makes up 42% of the business. The consumer remains strong.FY19 Revenue Growth in the range of 8-10%. AXP has reaffirmed this number the past two quarters despite only posting growth of 6.6% in Q1 and 8.4% in Q2. This has investors looking at the company either posting a back end loaded revenue number, which may be difficult given the slow down in commercial, or for AXP to lower the high end of this estimate.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jun) earnings of $2.07 per share, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.02. Revenues rose 8.4% year/year to $10.84 bln vs the $10.82 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Consolidated provisions for losses were $861 million, up 7 percent from $806 million a year ago. The increase reflected higher net lending write-offs driven by loan growth. Consolidated expenses were $7.8 billion, up 9 percent from $7.1 billion a year ago. The rise reflected, in part, growth in rewards and other customer engagement costs driven by increased Card Member spending, higher usage of card benefits and continued investments in cobrand partnerships. Operating expenses were up 7 percent from a year ago.Co reaffirmed guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $7.85-8.35 vs. $8.09 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The laggard of note is the information technology sector (-0.3%), which is being weighed down by the response to IBM's (IBM 134.26, -7.85, -5.5%) relatively disappointing earnings report.The health care sector is benefiting from news of a potential opioid settlement being in the works, which is leading to outsized gains for drug distributor stocks like McKesson (MCK 150.20, +5.36, +3.7%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.15, +2.08, +4.2%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.36, +3.31, +3.9%). The industrials sector is benefiting from positive responses to the earnings reports out of Honeywell (HON 168.00, +4.37, +2.7%), Dover (DOV 101.10, +5.28, +5.5%), United Rentals (URI 128.96, +7.29, +6.0%), CSX Corp. (CSX 70.58, +1.58, +2.3%) and Union Pacific (UNP 164.61, +1.30, +0.8%).Separately, the market has gotten a bit of a boost from reports that a Brexit compromise has been reached between the UK and EU; however, complete enthusiasm has been held in check by commensurate reports highlighting opposition from some parties that could negate this "deal."Speaking of deals, the "phase one" deal between the U.S. and China is still raising questions for market participants that is acting as a restraint on buyer confidence. According to a South China Morning Post report today, China is open to a partial deal, but says trade tensions will only end when all tariffs are lifted.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are up 0.3%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:19BRBR BellRing Brands opened for trading at $15.60 after pricing IPO at $1411:09MRTX Mirati Therapeutics +5% after confirming MRTX849 data presentations (84.07 +3.71)Mirati Therapeutics announced this morning that it will present pre-clinical data and initial clinical data for MRTX849, its novel and otpimized KRAS G12C inhibitor, in presentations at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, which will be held in Boston on October 26-30. Among these presentations, pre-clinical MRTX849 data will be showcased in an oral presentation, "The KRAS G12C Inhibitor, MRTX849, Provides Insight Toward Therapeutic Susceptibility of KRAS Mutant Cancers," in the afternoon on October 28, beginning at 4:20 p.m. EDT.The stock spiked by as much as 9% following the announcement.11:04IYT Better than feared results from rail carriers boost transport stocks (188.59 +1.21)Transport stocks have shown relative strength in the early going, helping the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.6%) extend this week's gain to 2.0%.Today's advance is receiving broad-based support, as all 20 components trade with gains while four group members are up more than 1.0%. Rail carriers CSX (CSX 70.54, +1.54, +2.2%) and Union-Pacific (UNP 164.68, +1.37, +0.8%) trade solidly higher after both companies reported their Q3 results. CSX exceeded earnings and revenue expectations while Union-Pacific missed. However, both companies showed an improvement in efficiency, which is being rewarded by the market.Another DJTA component-Kansas City Southern (KSU 134.79, +0.50, +0.4%)-will report its Q3 results ahead of tomorrow's open.Today's rally has lifted the DJTA to its best level in nearly a month, but the economically sensitive group remains inside a sideways range that has been in place for almost two years. The top of that range, which is about 10% above the current price level, was marked last September while the bottom, 18% below the current level, was notched in December 2018.11:01ECONX Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the week ending October 11, 2019U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15.4 million barrels per day during the week ending October 11, 2019, which was 221,000 barrels per day less than the previous week's average.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed.

The Nikkei was led lower by tech stocks. Tokyo Electron fell 9% after chip peer ASML saw weakness following earnings on Wednesday. In Europe, the major bourses are witnessing a mixed tape with the FTSE outpacing the region. The status of Brexit talks remains the key focus. The British pound has seen a volatile session and is up nearly 1%. This has not weighed on the FTSE, however. Outside of the UK, the markets have seen more of a cautious environment.

Guidance for 2019 remains unchanged. Recent test results from Kisladag confirm that recoveries from leaching deeper material over 250-day cycles support an extension of mine life beyond the company's current three-year guidance. Waste stripping to support a mine life extension will commence prior to the end of October. Test work is still ongoing to determine the ultimate heap leach recovery of this material and thus the ultimate length of the mine life extension. Waste stripping over the remainder of 2019 is expected to minimize production interruptions in 2020 and beyond. Estimated expenditure for waste stripping in 2019 is $4 mln. Production at Olympias was lower than plan. During the third quarter, measures to increase production volumes were continued in key areas of the operation and will support the ramp up towards 2020 and beyond. These measures included increased capital development resources and other operational improvement initiatives.17:37WTFC Wintrust Fin beats by $0.07, beats on revs (64.50 -0.29)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.69 per share, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.62; revenues rose 9.4% year/year to $380 mln vs the $374.98 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.17:36CCK Crown reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; guides Q4 EPS below consensus (63.53 +0.67)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.56 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.56; revenues fell 2.8% year/year to $3.08 bln vs the $3.19 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

In view of the Court's Order, VPX cannot interrupt distributors' and retailers' right to sell REIGN TOTAL BODY FUEL performance energy drinks. The Court's ruling also, notes Monster Energy, "strongly supports Monster's and Reign's previously stated belief that they will ultimately prevail against VPX's frivolous claims in this lawsuit."16:38NTDOY Nintendo Switch sales surpass 15 mln in North America (44.81 -1.12)Through September, Nintendo Switch sales in North America were up more than 20% year to date.16:36ETH Ethan Allen guides Q1 EPS in-line, revenue below (19.15 +0.20)Sees Q1 adj.

Price action didn't reflect buying confidence, though, as the benchmark index wavered mostly below its opening levels during the session to close below the 3000 level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%. The Russell 2000 rose 1.1% to outperform its large-cap peers.Gains were still registered in ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, though, with the lone exception being information technology (-0.2%) after IBM (IBM 134.26, -7.85, -5.5%) missed revenue estimates. The health care (+0.8%), real estate (+0.7%), and communication services (+0.6%) sectors outperformed the broader market.In the industrials sector (+0.5%), positive reactions to results from Honeywell (HON 167.55, +3.92, +2.4%), CSX (CSX 69.78, +0.78, +1.1%), United Rentals (URI 127.92, +6.25, +5.1%), and Dover (DOV 101.38, +5.56, +5.8%) outweighed the relative weakness in the defense stocks after Textron (TXT 47.79, -2.68, -5.3%) commented about lower defense volume.The health care space presumably outperformed on optimism that a $50 billion package offered by five companies could settle the opioid lawsuits. Companies involved include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 136.17, +1.00, +0.7%), Teva Pharma (TEVA 7.77, +0.82, +11.8%), McKesson (MCK 150.51, +5.67, +3.9%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.21, +2.14, +4.4%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.50, +3.45, +4.0%).The UK and EU announcing a Brexit agreement might have given investors some relief, but enthusiasm was kept in check after several parties expressed their disapproval in front of a crucial vote in Parliament this weekend. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.1% on Thursday.In other earnings news, Netflix (NFLX 293.35, +7.07, +2.5%) provided results that were construed as better than feared. Shares gained 2.5% but were up as much as 7.9% intraday. Morgan Stanley (MS 43.44, +0.65, +1.5%) topped expectations.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a lower note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.4% to 97.62. WTI crude rose 0.9%, or $0.47, to $53.89/bbl despite crude inventories rising more than expected in the EIA's weekly inventory report.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Total housing starts declined a disappointing 9.4% m/m in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.306 million). Building permits declined 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.387 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.350 million).The key takeaway from the Housing Starts and Building Permits report is that the month-over-month weakness was a function of downturns for multi-unit dwellings. Single-family starts were up 0.3% to 918,000 while single-family permits were up 0.8% to 882,000.Initial claims for the week ending October 12 increased by 4,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 5 decreased by 10,000 to 1.679 million.The key takeaway from the initial claims report is that it bodes well for another solid increase in October nonfarm payrolls, as this report covers the period in which the survey for the October employment report was conducted.Industrial production declined 0.4% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus -0.3%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 0.6%) in August. Total capacity utilization dropped to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.7%) from 77.9% in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the weakness was unduly influenced by the strike at General Motors (GM), which contributed to a 0.7% decline in the manufacturing output for durables.The Philadelphia Fed Index for October checked in at 5.6 (Briefing.com consensus 6.0) versus 12.0 in September.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for September on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +22.9% YTDS&P 500 +19.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.9% YTDRussell 2000 +14.3% YTD16:19FFBC First Financial beats by $0.01 (24.36 +0.39)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.56 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.55.Return on average assets for Q3 was 1.41% while return on average tangible common equity was 16.15%.

HEP's 2020 distribution guidance reflects growth from contractual tariff escalators and the recently announced Cushing Connect joint venture offset by lower revenues from Delek and elevated maintenance capital expenditures due to one-time events.Current yield: 12.4%16:17USAT USA Tech announces departure of CEO Steve Herbert; reaffirms FY20 outlook (7.11 -0.19)The company's Board has appointed current Board member Donald W.

In consideration of the Company's strong current capital position, combined with the prevailing depression of industry stock valuations, Independent Bank Corp.'s Board of Directors approved a stock buyback plan on October 17, 2019 which authorizes repurchases of up to 1.5 million shares. The plan will be in effect through October 31, 2020.16:14JNJ Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies announce new long-term data from open-label period of Phase 3 VOYAGE 1 clinical trial (136.17 +1.00)These data showed that 82% of patients receiving TREMFYA (guselkumab) in the combined group of patients initially randomized to TREMFYA or to placebo with crossover to TREMFYA at week 16 achieved at least a 90% improvement in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 90) response and an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of cleared (0) or minimal disease (1) at week 204 (4 years).

We expect fourth quarter revenue growth in the low- to mid- teens, which includes the impact of an additional week in the fourth quarter of 2019. Due to our strong performance year-to-date and expectations for continued positive momentum, we are increasing our EBITDA margin guidance for the full year 2019. We now expect EBITDA margin for the full year to be down approximately 25 basis points from the 27.3% achieved in 2018. This includes EBITDA1 margin declining 25 to 75 basis points in the fourth quarter, as compared to the same period a year ago."16:09PRTK Paratek Pharma withdraws MAA submission for NUZYRA (3.46 +0.01)Paratek Pharma has withdrawn its submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for NUZYRA (omadacycline). Based on the review of the data and the application, the EMA has recommended approval for NUZYRA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) but not for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). The EMA noted a second study is required for this indication; this position is consistent with EU guidance that typically requires two phase 3 studies per indication for approval.In Europe, the ten-year market exclusivity for NUZYRA would begin with the first approval. Ensuring an approval of both indications concurrently remains the company's top priority in order to maximize the value of NUZYRA upon an EU launch. The company plans to re-submit application to EMA following completion of the planned Post-Marketing Approval CABP study already agreed upon with the FDA.16:08CVTI Covenant Transport lowers Q3 earnings guidance (halted) (16.23 +0.27)Co sees Q3 (Sep), sees EPS of ($0.08)-(0.09), excluding items, vs. $0.25 S&P Capital IQ Consensus. This is an update from our previous statement that co expected third quarter 2019 Adjusted EPS to be fairly consistent with reported second quarter 2019 Adjusted EPS of $0.35 based on an expectation of the freight market improving to some extent and a relatively level sequential cost structure outside of the expected return to a normal level of non-driver wages. The main income differences between the second and third quarters relate to the higher non-driver wage expense, along with unfavorable casualty, workers' compensation and group health insurance expense as compared to the second quarter of 2019."The freight market remained relatively constant between the second quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2019, reflecting a negative environment in which available trucking capacity continues to exceed freight demand. Our average freight revenue per tractor per week, which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges, was approximately the same in both quarters. Within our truckload operations, operating expenses were not level as they increased 14.8 cents per total mile from the second quarter of 2019 to the 3rd quarter of 2019. The combination of the lack of benefit in the 3rd quarter that we experienced in the 2nd quarter to non-driver wages relating to the 2nd quarter reversal of previously accrued equity and cash incentive compensation and well above-average insurance expenses aggregated to a negative difference of approximately $10.9 million pre-tax, or $0.43 in diluted earnings per share between the quarters."16:07HBAN Huntington Banc appoints Zachary J.

Treasuries started the cash session with modest losses after the futures market saw some selling, which took place after it was announced that a revised Brexit deal has been reached. However, the optimism about the deal was guarded, since it remains unclear if the agreement will receive enough support in the British parliament. Treasuries widened their opening losses during the first hour of the session, but the selling pressure abated once the 10-yr note approached its session low from Tuesday. That dip took place despite the release of mostly underwhelming economic data, but mid-morning trade saw a rally to fresh highs. However, like the opening retreat, the rebound was modest in scope, pausing just below yesterday's intraday high. Another slow pullback took place in the afternoon, pressuring all tenors back into negative territory just before the close. The U.S. Dollar Index recorded its third consecutive decline, falling 0.4% to 97.62.

China's Ministry of Commerce spokesman, Gao Feng, delivered his regular press conference, but did not say anything new regarding negotiations with the U.S. China's agriculture ministry reported that large hog inventories increased 0.6% m/m in September, claiming that inventories at large farms have bottomed and are now rebounding. Chinese officials will now be required to notify the U.S. State Department ahead of planned meetings with U.S. government officials, educators, and researchers. Australia's September Employment Change totaled 14,700 (expected 15,300; last 34,700) while full employment increased by 26,200 (last -15,200). September Participation Rate ticked down to 66.1% (expected 66.2%) from 66.2% and the Unemployment Rate dipped to 5.2% (expected 5.3%) from 5.3%. Eurozone's August Construction Output decreased 0.46% m/m (last -0.18%). U.K.'s September Retail Sales were unchanged m/m (expected 0.1%; last -0.3%) while core Retail Sales increased 0.2% m/m (expected -0.1%; last -0.3%). Today's Data: Total housing starts declined a disappointing 9.4% m/m in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.306 million). Building permits declined 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.387 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.350 million). The key takeaway from the Housing Starts and Building Permits report is that the month-over-month weakness was a function of downturns for multi-unit dwellings. Single-family starts were up 0.3% to 918,000 while single-family permits were up 0.8% to 882,000. Initial claims for the week ending October 12 increased by 4,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 5 decreased by 10,000 to 1.679 million. The key takeaway from the initial claims report is that it bodes well for another solid increase in October nonfarm payrolls, as this report covers the period in which the survey for the October employment report was conducted. The Philadelphia Fed Survey decreased to 5.6 in October (Briefing.com consensus 6.0) from 12.0 in September. Industrial production declined 0.4% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus -0.3%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 0.6%) in August. Total capacity utilization dropped to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.7%) from 77.9% in August. The key takeaway from the report is that the weakness was unduly influenced by the strike at General Motors (GM), which contributed to a 0.7% decline in the manufacturing output for durables. Commodities: WTI crude: +1.0% to $53.89/bbl Gold: +0.3% to $1498.20/ozt Copper: +0.4% to $2.598/lb Currencies: EUR/USD: +0.5% to 1.1125 GBP/USD: +0.5% to 1.2875 USD/CNH: -0.3% to 7.0792 USD/JPY: -0.1% to 108.66 The Day Ahead: 10:00 ET: September Leading Inventories (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%; prior 0.0%)15:04XHB Industry Briefing: Homebuilders are moving higher today on strong housing data, especially in the South regionHomebuilders are trading higher today thanks to some positive housing data over the past couple of days. This morning, Census Bureau data showed that September Building Permits, at 1387K, came in above the Briefing.com consensus of 1350K. That's being viewed as particularly positive as permits are more of a leading indicator so that bodes well for future months.September Housing Starts were a bit light at 1256K vs 1306K Briefing.com consensus. However, the weakness was more on the multi-unit (2+ units) side as they dropped -28.2% month/month. Single-family starts ticked higher by +0.3%, which is good for homebuilders. And to drill a bit deeper, the South region led the way by a good margin for single-family starts at +7.1% whereas all other regions were negative. This is important because the South region is by far the largest region.Key Movers Today: MHO +3.6%, WLH +3%, TPH +2.6%, KBH +1.7%, TMHC +1.4%, NVR +1.3%.A couple of homebuilders with exposure to the southern US include:LGI Homes (LGIH) focuses on entry level homes. It's based just outside Houston and has a lot of exposure to the Texas market. Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) is based in Arizona. It builds homes from coast to coast, but has a good amount of exposure to the South and Texas via its Darling Homes segment.14:53XLI Sector Briefing: Industrials (77.79 +0.56)From a sector standpoint, there aren't any major standouts in today's trading action. Most sectors are up, but only one sector -- health care (+1.0%) -- is up at least 1.0%. One of the other leading sectors is the industrials sector (+0.8%).The relative strength among the industrials is owed in general to improved sentiment regarding the global growth outlook and specifically to positive moves made by several components following their earnings reports:Honeywell (HON 168.72, +5.09, +3.1%) beat Q3 earnings estimates and raised the low end of its FY19 adjusted EPS guidance range.Dover (DOV 101.22, +5.40, +5.6%) beat Q3 earnings and revenue estimates and narrowed its FY19 adjusted EPS guidance to the upper end of its prior guidance range.CSX Corp. (CSX 70.15, +1.15, +1.7%) exceeded the Q3 consensus EPS estimate, but industry peer Union Pacific (UNP 164.10, +0.79, +0.5%) came up short of expectations. Both railroad operators, however, impressed with their operating ratios.United Rentals (URI 127.83, +6.16, +5.1%) surpassed Q3 earnings and revenue estimates and provided a narrowed FY19 revenue guidance range that was slightly higher than the consensus estimate at the midpoint.Overall gains for the sector have been held in check, however, by weakness in Boeing (BA 370.02, -2.41, -0.7%), which follows news from Southwest (LUV 53.90, +0.23, +0.4%) that it's removing the 737 MAX from its flight schedule at least through February 8, and weakness in the defense stocks after Textron (TXT 48.13, -2.34, -4.6%) posted better-than-expected earnings results for the third quarter but noted that it saw lower defense volume for its Aviation segment and lower military volume for its Bell segment.14:31COMDX Energy Settlement PricesNov Crude Oil futures rose $0.34 (0.64%) to $53.76/barrel Nov Natural Gas closed flat at $2.32/MMBtu Nov RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 lower (-0.61%) at $1.62/gallon Nov Heating oil futures settled flat at $1.93/gallon14:26OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AXP Oct 120 calls (volume: 3910, open int: 390, implied vol: ~60%, prev day implied vol: 47%).

In fact, the company has exceeded EPS and revenue estimates for fifteen straight quarters.Additionally, its top-line growth has remained very consistent, ranging from 35-45% during this stretch.The steady results are impressive and have helped protect it from the onslaught that has buried many expensive cloud software stocks.While TEAM has shed 17% from its highs reached in August, names like Twilio (TWLO), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Zoom Video (ZM), and Workday (WDAY) have suffered larger losses. Since early August, those stocks are down 27%, 42%, 24%, and 20%, respectively.It is worth noting, though, that TEAM does have a history of issuing conservative guidance. It also has a history of barely edging out those quarterly expectations.For instance, for 3Q19 it issued inline EPS guidance and for 4Q19 it issued downside EPS guidance. On both occasions, TEAM's revenue guidance was slightly ahead of forecasts.Furthermore, the degree of its earnings beats has averaged a modest $0.02/share over the past eight quarters. With a 1-year forward P/S of ~15.5x, the margin for error is slim so even a slight deviation from these small beats could have a meaningful impact on the stock.1Q20 Expectations: Last quarter (4Q19), TEAM provided upside 1Q20 EPS guidance of $0.24 vs. the $0.21 consensus with revenue of $349-$353 mln compared to the $349.6 mln estimate.Despite TEAM's long track record of beating its own guidance, analysts' estimates match TEAM's outlook at EPS of $0.24 and revenue of $352 mln.Key Metrics: Unlike many cloud software companies, TEAM doesn't disclose many operating metrics, such as annual recurring revenue, retention rate, or large customer additions. Also unlike many cloud software companies, TEAM doesn't heavily focus on billings because it doesn't enter into many multi-year contracts.Operating margin is one metric that TEAM does highlight, though. Last quarter, Non-GAAP operating margin slipped 300 bps yr/yr to 17.0%. For this quarter, TEAM guided for operating margin of (3.0)%.Guidance: In the earnings press release, TEAM will likely provide EPS and revenue guidance for 2Q20. In order to meet expectations, it will need to guide for EPS of $0.26 and revenue of $381.5 mln.13:52COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $5.30 (0.36%) at $1497.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.18 higher (1.03%) at $17.6/oz Dec copper settled $0.01 higher (0.39%) at $2.6/lb13:21HMHC Houghton Mifflin Harcourt sees Q3 revs below consensus, raises FY 19 billings outlook, and announces 'workforce reductions' (4.89 -0.13)For the fiscal third quarter, the Company expects to report(1) net sales of $563 million vs $596 mln consensusThird quarter billings are expected to be $746 million, representing record growth of 30%, driven by expected Core Solutions billings growth of 50%, and expected Extensions billings growth of 25% compared to Q3'18HMH today updated its 2019 full year outlook to include its expectation of free cash flow in a range of $100 million to $120 million. Also, in light of its strong year-to-date financial performance, HMH revised its full year 2019 billings guidance range, which was previously $1,530 million to $1,610 million, to $1,590 million to $1,620 million with content development spend expected to be between $100 to $110 million and total capital expenditures to be between $150 and $160 million. The co also announced actions that are creating new product development and go-to-market capabilities, as well as the streamlining of operations company-wide for greater efficiency. These actions are expected to result in the elimination of 8% of HMH's workforce, after taking into account new strategy-aligned positions that are expected to be added and additional operating and capitalized cost reductions, including a redesigned product development model that is expected to result in approximately 20% less content development expenditures than previously planned over the next three years starting in 2020.13:02FIT Fitbit jumps 6% after announcing collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance (3.98 +0.24)The Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance and Fitbit today announced at the TIME 100 Health Summit in New York that they are working together to help drive timely diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with the aim of improving earlier detection in individuals at increased risk of stroke. The BMS-Pfizer Alliance and Fitbit plan to collaborate on the development of educational content and guidance to support people at increased risk for AFib. Upon submission and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the AFib detection software on Fitbit devices, the parties will aim to provide users with appropriate information to help encourage and inform discussions with their physicians.12:59WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks up but off session highs; S&P 500 near 3000 levelA strong start for the major averages has lost some steam, leaving the S&P 500 (+0.3%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) with modest gains. Weakness in IBM (IBM 133.35, -8.76, -6.2%) after a revenue miss is weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch) and S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.4%).The broader market remains slightly higher, though, thanks to relative strength in the S&P 500 health care (+0.9%), real estate (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.7%) sectors. Positive reactions to earnings reports from Honeywell (HON 167.99, +4.34, +2.7%), CSX (CSX 70.21, +1.22, +1.8%), and Union Pacific (UNP 165.48, +2.17, +1.3%) are supporting the industrials sector.As for health care, the group appears to be benefiting from a view that opioid litigation could be settled for a total package of $50 billion, according to Reuters. Companies involved in the offer include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 137.13, +1.96, +1.5%), Teva Pharma (TEVA 7.43, +0.48, +7.0%), McKesson (MCK 150.58, +5.76, +3.9%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.01, +1.94, +4.0%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.12, +3.08, +3.6%).Some cautious views on Brexit and a U.S.-China trade deal, meanwhile, may be restraining some buying conviction. A draft Brexit deal was announced, but some parties have already expressed their disapproval in front of a key vote this weekend. Separately, a report out of China reminded investors that Beijing wants all tariffs removed in order to end trade tensions.Isolated earnings reactions belong to Netflix (NFLX 298.10, +11.82, +4.1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS 43.83, +1.03, +2.4%). Netflix provided results that are being construed as better than feared, while Morgan Stanley beat top and bottom-line estimates.U.S. Treasuries have been on a steady rebound from overnight lows, leaving yields slightly lower. Germany lowering its 2020 growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.5% may have increased demand. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down two basis points to 1.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 97.58.Reviewing today's economic data:Total housing starts declined a disappointing 9.4% m/m in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.306 million).

Co notes that SY-5609 demonstrated greater anti-tumor activity than did SY-1365 in multiple preclinical models and that SY-1365 "did not support an optimal profile for patients" in initial data from the expansion of the Phase 1 trial of SY-1365.

At the Barclays conference on September 10, AXP laid out the reasoning behind its wider than usual range for EPS guidance. That was due to the uncertainty in the economic environment. Comments at Barclays suggested AXP would see the middle of that range. So analysts are expecting company to tighten the outlook. The midpoint will be key with current Capital IQ consensus sitting at $8.10. The primary weakness for AXP is around its commercial end which makes up 42% of the business. The consumer remains strong.FY19 Revenue Growth in the range of 8-10%. AXP has reaffirmed this number the past two quarters despite only posting growth of 6.6% in Q1 and 8.4% in Q2. This has investors looking at the company either posting a back end loaded revenue number, which may be difficult given the slow down in commercial, or for AXP to lower the high end of this estimate.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jun) earnings of $2.07 per share, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.02. Revenues rose 8.4% year/year to $10.84 bln vs the $10.82 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Consolidated provisions for losses were $861 million, up 7 percent from $806 million a year ago. The increase reflected higher net lending write-offs driven by loan growth. Consolidated expenses were $7.8 billion, up 9 percent from $7.1 billion a year ago.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed. It hasn't had a more pronounced impact, though, for several reasons:The U.S. market has never been fully bothered by the idea of a disorderly Brexit, content it seems to see it as more of an issue for the UK and the EU.There is ample doubt still that it will win approval in Parliament.The relatively subdued response in the UK's FTSE 100 (+0.5%) and in the British pound (+0.2% against the dollar) suggests there is reason to keep enthusiasm in check at the moment.08:04BYSI BeyondSpring: US Patent Office has granted the Company a new patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,357,491 B2, for methods of treating a brain tumor by administering Plinabulin (18.30 )The patent, which expires in 2036, covers methods for Plinabulin's use in the treatment of brain tumors, including metastatic brain tumor, with no approved chemotherapy on the market, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common adult brain tumor.

In August 2019, PM Izhora submitted its objections disagreeing with MTI's allegations set forth in the initial assessment and MTI's methodology for calculating the alleged underpayments. MTI accepted some of PM Izhora's arguments and in September 2019, issued the final tax assessment claiming an underpayment of RUB 24.3 billion (approximately $374 million) including penalties and interest.

This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability. Over the next 12-18 months, Alcoa intends to pursue non-core asset sales expected to generate an estimated $500 mln to $1 bln in net proceeds.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

In Study 202 (Rx nave patients), greater mean log10 declines in HBV DNA (5.27 vs 3.99; p=0.017) and RNA (2.34 vs 0.61; p<0.001) were achieved with 731+Nrtl (entecavir) versus entecavir alone. In Study 201 (Nrtl-suppressed patients), the proportion of patients on 731+Nrtl versus Nrtl alone achieving DNA target not detected (TND) was 69% vs 0% (p<0.001), and the proportion of patients achieving RNA <35 U/mL whose RNA was =35 U/mL at baseline was 52% vs 0% (p=0.0013) respectively. In Study 211, there are 64 HBeAg+ patients currently on extended treatment beyond 24 weeks. Among the 27 HBeAg+ patients receiving 731+Nrtl in Study 201, 41% (11/27) have now achieved DNA TND along with RNA <35 U/mL and HBeAg <1 IU/mL. At their last timepoint, Study 202 patients now in Study 211 (n=22) have demonstrated mean DNA and RNA declines of 6.1 and 3.0 logs, respectively, with observed mean log changes of =0.6 for HBeAg (11 patients =0.5, 4 patients =1.0), >0.8 log for HBcrAg (7 patients =1.0, 3 patients =2.0) and =0.4 log for HBsAg (7 patients =0.5, 3 patients =1.0). 731 continues to exhibit a favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients treated for up to 1 year, with only mild/moderate adverse events and lab abnormalities, and only a single discontinuation due to a Grade 1 rash. The combination of 731+NrtI results in faster and deeper declines in HBV DNA and RNA than NrtI alone, as well as subsequent declines in the surrogate markers of cccDNA (pgRNA, HBeAg and HBcrAg) predictive of cccDNA pool depletion, and HBsAg. The emergent data supports the continued development of 731. ABI-H2158 -- The Second-Generation Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Core Inhibitor (CI) ABI-H2158 is Associated with Potent Antiviral Activity in a 14-Day Monotherapy Study in HBeAg-positive Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)Abstract Summary: The Phase 1b study is enrolling sequential cohorts of 9 patients and each cohort will be randomized to receive 2158 or placebo (7:2) QD for 14 days in a blinded manner. Dosing in the 1st cohort (100 mg) has been completed. In patients receiving 2158, mean declines from Baseline to Day 15 in HBV DNA and RNA levels were 2.3 log10 IU/mL [range 1.7 -- 3.0] and 2.1 log10 IU/mL [range 1.5 - 2.7] respectively. No serious AEs, dose limiting toxicities or premature discontinuations were reported. Three patients reported a total of 5 mild, drug-related AEs that recovered without intervention; dizziness, fatigue, rash, headache and upper abdominal pain. Treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities were infrequent, mild and transient, with no ALT elevations Grade =1 in severity. Day 14 plasma 2158 Cmax and AUC0-24hr were 3,390 ng/mL and 46,100 hr*ng/mL, respectively. Results from the initial 100 mg low dose of ABI-H2158 cohort demonstrated potent antiviral activity, a favourable safety profile when administered for 14 days, and support once daily dosing in CHB patients.07:43PAG Penske Auto increases quarterly dividend to $0.41/share from $0.40/share (45.08 )07:38ABT Abbott Labs reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q4 EPS in-line (81.98 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.84 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.84; revenues rose 5.5% year/year to $8.08 bln vs the $8.1 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus, and 7.6 percent on an organic basis including 3.8% in nutrition, 6.6% in diagnostics, 7.9% in established pharma and 10.6% in medical devices.

This change in top line performance, coupled with lower factory absorption, higher operating expenses arising largely from acquisitions, and other factors, will adversely affect net income for the period. Thus, management expects that quarterly earnings per share are likely to be less than half of the [$0.23] consensus estimate and will provide conclusive data on that subject in its next earnings release."Focusing on full year 2019 results, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 6% year-over-year with mixed performance among our major markets. International sales should increase by about 27% for the full year. However, our domestic sales will likely decrease by about 5% on a per annum basis, which we believe is consistent with industry-wide forecasts showing domestic markets receding by 6% to 12%. With these considerations in mind, we are revising our full year 2019 net sales forecast downward to ~$480 million [from $500 mln vs. $499 mln consensus]. Other previously forecasted financial metrics relating to 2019 remain unchanged since our last earnings call."16:29LW Lamb Weston forms joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina (75.50 -0.34)Lamb Weston has formed a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina to serve the nearly 2-billion-pound South American market.

In Study 202 (Rx nave patients), greater mean log10 declines in HBV DNA (5.27 vs 3.99; p=0.017) and RNA (2.34 vs 0.61; p<0.001) were achieved with 731+Nrtl (entecavir) versus entecavir alone. In Study 201 (Nrtl-suppressed patients), the proportion of patients on 731+Nrtl versus Nrtl alone achieving DNA target not detected (TND) was 69% vs 0% (p<0.001), and the proportion of patients achieving RNA <35 U/mL whose RNA was less than 35 U/mL at baseline was 52% vs 0% (p=0.0013) respectively. In Study 211, there are 64 HBeAg+ patients currently on extended treatment beyond 24 weeks. Among the 27 HBeAg+ patients receiving 731+Nrtl in Study 201, 41% (11/27) have now achieved DNA TND along with RNA <35 U/mL and HBeAg <1 IU/mL. At their last timepoint, Study 202 patients now in Study 211 (n=22) have demonstrated mean DNA and RNA declines of 6.1 and 3.0 logs, respectively, with observed mean log changes of more than or equal to 0.6 for HBeAg (11 patients more than or equal to 0.5, 4 patients more than or equal to 1.0), >0.8 log for HBcrAg (7 patients more than or equal to 1.0, 3 patients more than or equal to 2.0) and more than or equal to 0.4 log for HBsAg (7 patients more than or equal to 0.5, 3 patients more than or equal to 1.0). 731 continues to exhibit a favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients treated for up to 1 year, with only mild/moderate adverse events and lab abnormalities, and only a single discontinuation due to a Grade 1 rash. The combination of 731+NrtI results in faster and deeper declines in HBV DNA and RNA than NrtI alone, as well as subsequent declines in the surrogate markers of cccDNA (pgRNA, HBeAg and HBcrAg) predictive of cccDNA pool depletion, and HBsAg. The emergent data supports the continued development of 731. ABI-H2158 -- The Second-Generation Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Core Inhibitor (CI) ABI-H2158 is Associated with Potent Antiviral Activity in a 14-Day Monotherapy Study in HBeAg-positive Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)Abstract Summary: The Phase 1b study is enrolling sequential cohorts of 9 patients and each cohort will be randomized to receive 2158 or placebo (7:2) QD for 14 days in a blinded manner. Dosing in the 1st cohort (100 mg) has been completed. In patients receiving 2158, mean declines from Baseline to Day 15 in HBV DNA and RNA levels were 2.3 log10 IU/mL [range 1.7 -- 3.0] and 2.1 log10 IU/mL [range 1.5 - 2.7] respectively. No serious AEs, dose limiting toxicities or premature discontinuations were reported. Three patients reported a total of 5 mild, drug-related AEs that recovered without intervention; dizziness, fatigue, rash, headache and upper abdominal pain. Treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities were infrequent, mild and transient, with no ALT elevations Grade more than or equal to 1 in severity.

We have evaluated strategic alternatives to maximize the value of the Kitchen Collection business and reached the difficult but necessary decision that it is in the best interests of the company and all of its stakeholders to wind down the business by the end of 2019."During the third quarter, Kitchen Collection expects to record a non-cash, pretax impairment charge of $1 mln related to property, plant and equipment and a valuation allowance of $1.9 mln related to deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating losses. During the fourth quarter, Kitchen Collection expects to incur expenses in the range of $4 mln to $6 mln.

Additionally, our performance in the third quarter allowed us to increase our 2019 expected incentive payout resulting in an increase of $7.5 million in third quarter incentive costs over the amount recorded in the second quarter. We anticipate that incentive costs for the fourth quarter of 2019 will be less than those recorded in the third quarter and more consistent with the amounts reported in the second quarter of 2019."17:27NTRA Natera files for $175 mln common stock shelf offering (39.22 +1.03)17:26ARCE Arco Platform files for $1 bln mixed securities shelf offering (48.25 +1.70)17:19SU Suncor Energy announces closing of investment in Enerkem (29.77 -0.17)Enerkem, a waste-to-biofuels and chemicals producer, today announced the closing of a $50 mln equity investment from Suncor.

This change in top line performance, coupled with lower factory absorption, higher operating expenses arising largely from acquisitions, and other factors, will adversely affect net income for the period. Thus, management expects that quarterly earnings per share are likely to be less than half of the [$0.23] consensus estimate and will provide conclusive data on that subject in its next earnings release."Focusing on full year 2019 results, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 6% year-over-year with mixed performance among our major markets. International sales should increase by about 27% for the full year. However, our domestic sales will likely decrease by about 5% on a per annum basis, which we believe is consistent with industry-wide forecasts showing domestic markets receding by 6% to 12%. With these considerations in mind, we are revising our full year 2019 net sales forecast downward to ~$480 million [from $500 mln vs. $499 mln consensus]. Other previously forecasted financial metrics relating to 2019 remain unchanged since our last earnings call."16:29LW Lamb Weston forms joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina (75.50 -0.34)Lamb Weston has formed a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina to serve the nearly 2-billion-pound South American market.

Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors.

"People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher.

CHINA PUTS THE FULL-COURT PRESS ON AMERICANS IN NBA CONTROVERSYStates News ServiceOctober 17, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 650 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ALEXANDRIA, VA BodyThe following information was released by the American Spectator Foundation:by James DelmontThe Hong Kong saga reached a climax this past week with back-to-back American corporate capitulations to the Chinese government. The spotlight has been on the National Basketball Association's disastrous handling of a proHong Kong tweet made by Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets' general manager, but many other supposedly all-American firms have added to the humiliation.Apple has restricted the Taiwanese flag emoji for devices in Hong Kong. It removed an app used by the protesters to track police, reinstated it after a backlash, and then removed it again upon being issued an ominous warning by the People's Daily, the Communist Party's primary mouthpiece. Videogame giant Blizzard Entertainment panicked after a player from Hong Kong spoke out in support of the protests during an official event: they banned the player and confiscated his prize money.Washington Post columnist Sally Jenkins pointed out last week that this rout is far from the first, or most egregious, example of corporate appeasement of China. Nonetheless, its visibility to the American public may serve to shore up a weak point in the U.S.'s combative stance toward the Chinese regime: the attitudes of American consumers.A Morning Consult poll of Americans conducted October 8 and 9 in the immediate aftermath of the Morey fallout paints a picture of indifference. Thirty-eight percent of all adults would prefer that corporations stick to doing business and refrain from engaging in political or cultural issues, an echo of the advice that NBA players are receiving in private to "tread lightly" and avoid discussing Hong Kong. A further 38 percent have no opinion on the matter.Obviously, American corporations, including the NBA, do not usually "stick to what they do" anyone who thinks otherwise need only look around during Pride Month. NBA players have been quick to trash President Trump and embrace social-justice movements such as Black Lives Matter when doing so earns them brownie points with woke millennials and costs them very little. With China, though, their multi-million-dollar salaries are on the line. Cue the sudden uninterest in politics: LeBron James, who once tweeted that "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere," now subscribes to the philosophy of "we're not politicians."In light of all the progressive browbeating, it is understandable that conservatives are more suspicious of corporate activism than liberals. Only 20 percent of Republican respondents to the Morning Consult poll approve of corporations using their influence to "impact political and cultural issues" in other countries, compared to 31 percent of Democrats. But continued indifference cannot be justified. There is no such thing as simply doing business with a customer like China, whose leaders are willing and able to squeeze geopolitical leverage out of every international business relationship.What should conservatives do? Before anything else, they need to leverage their power as consumers. Companies such as the NBA that lecture Americans on inclusivity at home and then accede to the whims of exclusive regimes abroad should be roundly mocked and exposed for the hypocrites they are. Beyond that, Chinese goods ought to be boycotted with the understanding that buying from China is always more than just a financial transaction.There is still a long way to go before most Americans are willing to accept that economic engagement with China is a geopolitical trap. The same Morning Consult poll found that 42 percent of all U.S. adults currently support American corporations doing business in China, with only 36 percent opposed a major roadblock to the efforts of President Trump and his allies to combat China. With the NBA's helpful and timely reminder of China's influence, the tide may finally be turning.Load-Date: October 18, 2019End of Document

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, October 10th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.U.S.-China trade focus today. Big story as investors await any details out of these high level talks that are getting under way this morning in Washington. The U.S. also could be easing some restrictions on Huawei. We've got that for you.There was a lot of volatility in markets overnight after there was a report that the Chinese delegation would be leaving today and then saying no, we're leaving Friday.Ahead of the talks, futures showing the markets are lower this morning. We're expecting a decline at the start of trading -- fractional move after a big gain yesterday on the hopes of at least partial trade deal.Dow Industrials finished off 182 points at the close yesterday, three- quarters of 1 percent. The S&P was up 26. And the Nasdaq up 80 points, better than 1 percent.Global markets this morning look like this. European indices are mixed. FT 100 down 9. CAC 40 in Paris up 17. And the DAX index in Germany lower by 2 points. And the economic data driving stories there.In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher with the Korean KOSPI index bucking the trend, lower after a holiday the day before -- fractional moves across the board there.China continues a full court press on the NBA. An exhibition game still scheduled to tip off in about half an hour. It's happening in shanghai this morning but it will not be seen on televisions in China.Other related events were canceled and Chinese businesses continue to pull away from the league.Also off the air there -- "South Park" but that doesn't stop the show from taking a swipe at China last night.Plus, Apple removes a controversial app that tracks police activity in Hong Kong citing safety reasons. Companies are caving in to China's demands.Facebook's other social media brands, meanwhile -- a new poll shows most people do not even realize they're using apps owned by Facebook. The numbers coming up.All those stores coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business' Dagen McDowell. The "Wall Street Journal's" wealth management reporter. She's the host of the podcast, "Secrets of Wealthy Women" -- Veronica Dagher. And the assistant editorial page editor at the "Wall Street Journal" -- James Freeman.Lots to talk about this morning.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Yes. I hope if President Trump doesn't get a deal soon with China. I hope he moves quickly to make trade peace with all of our friends around the world.The Japan deal is a good template. I would say if you're going to play this out with China, you need a reason to give people to invest and other trade deals would be very helpful.BARTIROMO: You want something like TPP.FREEMAN: That that would be nice.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: I know you don't -- you can't call it that. So, you know, new plan but you did it with japan, how about every other country, offer them the same deal and try to get that done and then, you know, you've got leverage to play it out with China. We'll see where it goes.BARTIROMO: And then there's Brexit. You have to believe that once Brexit does happen, if it happens, he'll move aggressively to do a deal with the U.K.FREEMAN: That would help too. And of course, the Congress can help by passing the USMCA with Canada and Mexico. Maybe they will --BARTIROMO: Well, that's up to Nancy Pelosi.FREEMAN: Yes. But she might -- there might be an incentive to show they're not just the impeachment Congress.BARTIROMO: That's true.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That they actually care about the American people? Really? Ok.BARTIROMO: We'll see. We'll see.Right now it's all about taking down the President.VERONICA DAGHER, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": And what kind of trade deal are we going to get? I'm just curious though, right? Is it going to be a skinny deal that some people are speaking about? Because if we get that skinny deal, I just wonder, to your point from before, how much is that really going to move the market in the long term?BARTIROMO: Yes. I don't know that that's going to be all that positive. Maybe we get a rally on news of a skinny deal. We'll see.But that push for impeachment is certainly top of news. Supporting the impeachment of President Trump reaching a record high, apparently. According to a new Fox News poll, the majority of voters say that they want President Trump impeached and removed from office. That's up 9 points from July.Former vice president Joe Biden officially backing calls for the push. The 2020 hopeful trading barbs with President Trump yesterday. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts. To preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't think he's going to make it. I didn't think he was going to make it for a long time. I don't think he's going to make it.And I guess this is one way he could do it. He didn't say that until right now and he sees what's happening to him. I guess he's no longer the frontrunner.And he's been caught red-handed. I mean here's a man who is on tape saying exactly what he's going to do in terms of corruption and he gets away with it. If that ever happened to a Republican, they'd be getting the electric chair right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Fox News contributor, former House Speaker and "Trump versus China" author, Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker -- it's always a pleasure. Thanks for joining us -- Newt.NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's good to be with you.BARTIROMO: What do you make of these polls that say 51 percent of people would like to see the impeachment? Are you buying this?GINGRICH: Look, I think if you have week after week of the "New York Times" and "Washington Post" and all the major networks giving their version of reality, it has an effect. Does it mean that Trump's going to lose the election? No. Does it mean he's going to be impeached? No.But a lot of this is just the sheer weight of unbelievably biased coverage and the fact that the Democrats have been playing a game. The fact is, for example, you have a guy who is a leaker who we call a whistleblower because that sounds so much nicer, he didn't blow a whistle on anything. He didn't witness anything.It's now turning out he's a Democrat. He may well have actually worked with some of the Democratic presidential candidates. But all of this takes a while.And we've seen this three or four times now. We saw it with Judge Kavanaugh.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: We saw it earlier with the Russian collusion. You know, the news media comes in, creates a totally biased story. For a brief period the country goes well, if that's true, then of course you're right. And then they begin to go yes, but it's not true. And then gradually we get back to where we were.So my guess is in a week or two Trump will be back at about where he's been all along which is 45 percent support and considering that he probably is at 5 to 8 percent above that, just because people in this kind of environment, people won't tell you they're for Trump.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: Because the social pressure's so great.BARTIROMO: So are you -- do you agree with the White House's move to say I'm not going to cooperate with the impeachment measures because it's an impeachment show. They need to take the floor --GINGRICH: You know look, this --BARTIROMO: -- let me just show you this editorial piece in the "Journal" this morning. You've seen it this morning, "Back to you, Nancy". The editorial board of the "Wall Street Journal" writes this. "No one should be surprised if the White House chooses to fight back and hard when Democrats are trying to remove Mr. Trump from office and brand him as impeached for 2020. The Pelosi Democrats are fighting ugly and Mr. Trump is fighting ugly back."This is what I find really interesting because the Democrats always fight ugly. They're not afraid to get in the mud. That's just been who -- that's who they are, that's been the case for years.They haven't met a guy like Mr. Trump who says you know what, yes, let's get in the mud, I'm ready for it and fights back the way he does. They don't like it.GINGRICH: That's right. That's how he won the presidency. If he hadn't been prepared to match Hillary and to stay slugging it out, he wouldn't have become president. So it shouldn't surprise us any.This is not an impeachment. I mean I'm going to make this very clear. This is a coup. The first left wing gathering of the crisis level was on the ninth on November, 2016 -- the day after the election. They had gatherings in eight or nine cities.By the middle of December of that year, "Vanity Fair" had an article on the movement to impeach Trump. By the day of the inaugural, the "Washington Post" -- literally, the day of the inaugural, the "Washington Post" had a story that the move to impeach Trump was underway and the following day of course you had a huge series of rallies against Trump all over the country, the day after he's sworn in.So this shouldn't surprise anybody. The left hates Trump, that includes the "New York Times" and the "Washington Post". They're going to do everything they can to destroy him. They can't -- they're afraid he'll win the next election so they're trying to find somebody.But in the end, it's pretty stupid. I mean, you know, Nancy Pelosi can't even play tic tac toe. She can't figure out that there's a second step.For example, this guy who they're keeping secret, well, if they do pass impeachment, it goes to the Senate. And Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has already said the minute it gets to the Senate, he's having this guy in under oath and public.BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: So they haven't thought through that. Act two is the Republicans in the Senate. They're going to ask Hunter Biden what did you do for $600,000 a year.MCDOWELL: Newt -- it's Dagen McDowell. It looks like that the Democrats are trying to trip up the President or set up the President, if you will. And trick him into doing something they could then say oh, obstruction of Congress -- you've actually heard them say that. We're going to now impeach him for obstruction of Congress when he wasn't actually doing anything to obstruct an impeachment proceeding that actually isn't an impeachment proceeding because they haven't voted on it yet.Again, if you read the -- if you read every word in some of these newspaper articles, not the "Wall Street Journal", and they will say, well, one of the articles of impeachment under Richard Nixon was failure to provide information to Congress related to the inquiry. So you see where they're going here.GINGRICH: Sure. But let's start with -- you know, a reporter said the other day that Speaker Pelosi -- what if this doesn't work out and this guy doesn't stand up. And her answer was oh, we have many candidates for impeachment. This is just the easiest one to explain.I mean this is all a game. And that's why it's not an impeachment. It's a coup. It has nothing to do with the constitutional concept of impeachment which is for high crimes and -- it has nothing to do with that.This has to do with left wing Democrats who can't stand the idea that the American people gave the White House to somebody who clearly violates all of their norms and actually behaves as though he's a conservative and he's the most aggressive anti-liberal in my lifetime and it drives them crazy. So I don't think they can control themselves.Part two of this is not Trump leaving Washington. Part two is if they have the nerve -- I said openly, you can always impeach if you have a majority if you're prepared to commit suicide.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: Nancy Pelosi forces all of her moderate and red district Democrats to vote yes on impeachment. Collin Peterson's a good example, he's in a Minnesota district that was 30 points for Trump.Now how is he going to vote yes in impeachment and run for reelection. And so if she's prepared to become the minority leader again, they can get the patient to the House then it goes to the Senate where I think they get ripped to shreds.And I think you get Biden brought in and they say were you not aware that your son was making $600,000 a year. I mean, does anybody in America believe that my two daughters could be making $600,000 a year and I wouldn't know it?BARTIROMO: $600,000 a year.GINGRICH: And that's the Biden current claim.BARTIROMO: From Ukraine? Wow.GINGRICH: from one company. Just from Ukraine. That doesn't count whatever else he was making.BARTIROMO: I didn't realize it was $600,000.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: ok. Newt -- thank you.GINGRICH: I cheated. It's $50,000 a month times 12 so $600,000 a year.MCDOWELL: Which is roughly double what an ExxonMobil board member makes.ExxonMobil board member in the most recent fiscal year made about [$300,000] on average, $330,000, so Hunter Biden whose work experience was being on the board of Amtrak was making 600 grand a year.FREEMAN: Are you saying that Burisma is no ExxonMobil?GINGRICH: Wait a second. It's totally legitimate for Biden to be on the Amtrak board because Joe went back and forth to Wilmington on Amtrak all the time. They had a lot of knowledge about Amtrak.I would like to know, other than maybe reading Wikipedia, what did Hunter know about anything involving Ukrainian national gas company?BARTIROMO: Yes, yes.Well, similar story in China where, you know, the money was big there. The $1 billion which turned into $1.5 billion after his trip with his father on Air Force 2. Newt, thank you. Good to see you, sir.GINGRICH: Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: Newt Gingrich there.While we were talking Delta Airlines reported earnings.Lauren Simonetti with the numbers now -- Lauren.SIMONETTI: Yes. The stock not liking what came out in terms of earnings. As you can see, it's down 0.8 percent. This is the second best airline carrier of the year.Ok. So earnings per share were better than expected, $2.32 a share versus the estimate of $2.26. But a miss by a little bit when it came to revenue. Coming in at $12.56 billion.Investors are concerned about what is going forward for Delta. Their guidance was very light for the all-important holiday quarter. That's the fourth quarter. They guided in a range of $1.20, to $1.50 when the (INAUDIBLE) estimate is $1.51. so much lower there.And then you have to remember. They don't fly -- and this a good thing for them -- the 737 Max jet that's been under fire but when that returns, they might be affected by pricing from other airlines. So those are some head winds affecting the company, especially an economic slowdown on an international level that could affect them going forward.Back to you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you, Lauren. Stock is down better than 1 percent. We've got a big show this morning. Don't miss it. The "Gartman Letter" editor and publisher Dennis Gartman is coming up.To talk markets and China. The CEO of Waze, Noam Bardin is here. The company marking one year since its carpool service debut and Google partnership. And then the former senior advisor to President George W. Bush, Fox News contributor Karl Rove joining us to talk impeachment and his "Wall Street Journal" op-ed ed today. House Financial services committee member. Congressman Lance Gooden is here and the CEO of Sanders -- Francis David Savin talks short-term rentals and hotel industry, similar to Air BNB but not really. We'll tell you about.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, two British ISIS prisoners now in custody in the U.S. Cheryl Casone with the details -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well Maria -- the two ISIS fighters tied to the notorious British terror cell, the Beatles, they are the only two ISIS fighters removed from removed from Syria by the U.S. so far but officials say, there could be more thousands of others remain in custody under Kurdish control as of now.Well, when it comes to social media business in particular -- American Cinderella come up short and their knowledge. According a new Pew Center of Survey. Just 29 percent of us know that Instagram and What's App are owned by Facebook.Over all less than half of those asked knew the answers to a digital knowledge quiz but there's Facebook in the pre-market, down slightly.Ok.And then I love this story -- Maria. Uber is now letting your pets come along for the ride. They're now letting passengers bring along their furry friends to reduce cancellations. Surprised pets, believe it or not, are one of drivers' biggest complaints. The new program is going to be available in select cities. That starts on October 16th.Because don't discriminate against my dog or my cat. Come on now.BARTIROMO: Yes.CASONE: It's ridiculous.Yes. Drivers were flipping out about it. Well, too bad.MCDOWELL: Let me point out, if you've got a fluffy little nugget like a Charlie or a Dusty that can sit in your lap, that's a big difference than a Slob-o-pus who gets in your car and starts shedding everywhere.(CROSSTALKING)MCDOWELL: Like a bloodhound.BARTIROMO: That's the same thing as traveling with your dog on an airplane, right?MCDOWELL: Airplanes have become a nightmare though.BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean you can't have that kind of a big dog on a plane.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying. If you have a small dog, it's ok, it doesn't cause too much disruption, what's the problem?MCDOWELL: But now if you have the dog, if you put it in a crate and pay $125, $150 per trip for a dog, put it under the seat like luggage. But if you have the dog out, you have to -- they've really cracked down on emotional support certificates for people. And so even if you take your dog out of the crate, they lose their business.And people -- it's not just an Uber driver. It's all the other people on the plane where some individuals like to make up that they have dog allergies.BARTIROMO: I think they're making -- I agree with you.MCDOWELL: Ma'am, if you have a dog allergy, you need to tell the airline in advance.BARTIROMO: I told the airline in advance that Charlie would be here -- period.MCDOWELL: Right. I have my -- yes. I drive now.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Then you've got Charlie right there in the car.MCDOWELL: Yes. Exactly.BARTIROMO: Coming up, Apple is under pressure this morning. The technology giant removes a controversial app that tracks police activity in Hong Kong. The reason they removed it -- are they caving like others? We'll take a look.Then testing optional, a growing number of colleges remove standardized test requirements.Back in a minute with that.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.American companies eager to reach China's 1.4 billion people are now facing censorship hurdles.Deirdre Bolton is covering the story this morning. And it is getting wider and wider and wider.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: It sure is. And Apple is the latest one. They removed the HKMap.live app from its app store. And the "People's Daily" had actually criticized Apple saying that they had not -- I'm quoting here, "The People's Daily, obviously state-run media -- Apple had not hidden their malicious motive in providing navigation for the riders.Apple -- and this is coming from Apple, this is their statement. The App has been used in ways that endangers law enforcement and residents. So they're basically saying both sides are finding out where these protesters are showing up and it's just augmenting a very tense situation.But Apple was clear to us in its statement, in its response saying, "We pulled this app because of safety concerns, not political concerns," because of course the larger conversation we've been having with these U.S. big brands, I mean whether it's the NBA or Activision Blizzard or Vans sneakers or Tiffany's is that U.S. companies are caving.The one thing I will say about big tech functioning on mainland China -- is that it's really two companies that we would know the name of. It's basically Apple and Microsoft. Both of those companies over the years have at least agreed to play -- if they're not playing ball with the Chinese state, they're at least playing a few innings.Google is not there. Google started to do some work called Dragon Fly. It was going to be a search engine over there but its own employees really just raised such a fuss that the company ended up killing it.Facebook we know really tried to be there. I mean Mark Zuckerberg was teaching himself Mandarin. He was going over. He was courting officials. It just didn't work out.And then eventually this spring Mark Zuckerberg said something like, kind of like it was a bit of sour grapes. Let's hear it from the cynical perspective, well, we didn't really want to be there anyway.But both Apple and Microsoft have found a way, love it or hate it, to actually work within the system. I just want to quote one of the people from Apple. It's policy chief saying that censoring for the Chinese government, so Apple is there, they know that censorship happens, but she says encourages greater overall freedoms and that it facilitates the free flow of ideas and information.Now, there are a lot of people who call absolute nonsense on that quote and they say look, Apple just has so much of a presence there and a footprint there, that it is in their best interest to get along.But more recently Apple has removed pro democracy songs by Hong Kong singers from the Chinese music store. It did remove Taiwan's flag from the emoji library. And as we know, I mean Taiwan and China have been governed for decades separately but the idea of the Communist manifesto is for reunification and then with this latest salvo is this hot maps in Hong Kong.Microsoft we know, bought LinkedIn and they have LinkedIn up and running there. And they say well, we can't really pull out of China with LinkedIn because then that deprives the Chinese people of looking for their hopes and dreams.As they said, maybe not willing to play ball, Apple and Microsoft, but they're certainly willing to play a few innings.MCDOWELL: What was the statement again? We need to impose censorship in order to promote free speech?BOLTON: That's from Apple. Yes, that's Apple.MCDOWELL: Can you believe what it sounds like? It's like censorship somehow --BOLTON: You remember this when Apple agreed to let some data centers be on the mainland and people went absolutely bananas about that. And that's the response as you said. I know. It sounds.When you read it, you're just like --BARTIROMO: You know I would like to see it. I'd like to hear from right now, the Business Roundtable, right.The Business Roundtable said that they want to put profits second or third after the other stakeholders, employees and the communities they operate in. What does the Business Roundtable have to say about China's behavior?DAGHER: Well, just as you allude to the statistics, 1.4 million inhabitants in China.BARTIROMO: 1.4 billion.(CROSSTALKING)DAGHER: Yes, exactly -- billion.MCDOWELL: That's them kowtowing to a different communist.FREEMAN: The community should be worried about those -- the stakeholders. I also -- I wonder about these Silicon Valley people, who tell us how much they care about civil liberties, the Activision employees were -- some of them were demonstrating --BOLTON: Yes. Because they stripped that young man of his gaming title and actually his prize money because he did make a statement on a streaming service in support of the Hong Kong pro democracy protesters.BARTIROMO: Right. Well, Google did not want to be evil so they walked away from the Pentagon. But they set up shop for their A.I.(CROSSTALKING)BOLTON: So actually to me, that's actually the bigger problem I think going forward is that we depend, happily or unhappily, on companies like Google to develop our next generation of A.I. And so if we're not letting that happen, or Google's employees are blocking that, then you can make an argument we're at a disadvantage versus the Chinese when it comes to this kind of technology.BARTIROMO: Companies are waking up to this and you have to thank not just President Trump but Secretary Pompeo. He's done a great job in speaking to businesses about the national security issues around that.BOLTON: Yes.BARTIROMO: Deirdre -- thank you.BOLTON: Sure. Thanks.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.Coming up markets are watching all of these developments. U.S. and Chinese officials meeting later this morning, the expectations coming up.Markets have worsened in the last hour, down 58 points on the Dow Industrials now.Then this crypto warning, an Apple co-founder speaks out about regulating digital currency, his comments right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Our top story this half an hour, the U.S.-China trade situation, the two sides are holding high level negotiations this morning in Washington ahead of increased U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods coming into this country, that is set to go into effect October 15th. There was a lot of volatility in the markets overnight after a report said that the Chinese delegation would be leaving today. The White House said that it has no knowledge of any news that it would be leaving early.Joining us right now is The Gartman Letter editor and publisher, Dennis Gartman. And Dennis, it is good to see you this morning. Thanks for being here.DENNIS GARTMAN, EDITOR AND PUBLISHER, THE GARTMAN LETTER: Thanks for having me. You guys scraped the bottom of the barrel and there I am.BARTIROMO: So -- what? Not true, Dennis. But tell me this, how are you investing and what do you see about this China story that is actually dictating how you allocate capital and look at these markets.GARTMAN: Well, first of all, I have only my own money at risk, it's my few million source, very -- it's sacrosanct and what I talked about in my newsletter I do. And for the first time in quite some long while I'm actually getting modestly and I mean, the operative word here is modestly net short.I'm a little concerned about how quickly things sold off last night on the mere rumor and a rumor of a rumor that the Sherpas had not been able to reach and sort of an agreement and that there would be a delay or even an early leaving by the senior Chinese delegation.So the fact that you were able to give up almost 400 Dow points in the course of a half an hour, tells me that underneath here there's nothing but thin air. So you have to be very careful. I think that the -- I keep in my own index called the international index of the 10 largest stock markets in the world and it made its high last January, January 29th actually of 19 -- 2018, we have not come anywhere close to being -- to making new highs. And so we've actually been in an international bear market for almost a year and-a-half. Let's be careful.FREEMAN: OK, so given that the downer for the markets, the trade fights have been and now the president facing possible impeachment, do you think he now gets a deal? Is there -- is it a necessity for him and how do the markets react?GARTMAN: I think it's an -- James, I think it's a necessity for both presidents, for Xi and for Trump to get some sort of a deal. It's going to be what's the term now, a skinny deal, it won't be a broad and expansive deal, we won't probably be able to get intellectual property rights taken care of. We'll probably not be able to get infrastructure. We'll probably not be able to get a broader representation. We'll get some soybeans sold. We might even get some corn sold. But will there be anything broad and expansive? Sadly, probably not. Will the Chinese give us promises that they won't keep? Probably so. And sadly, that's just the history of these sorts of agreements.So it will be less than anybody hoped for (INAUDIBLE). And we'll probably have to wait until after the next election to get an expansive trade agreement signed between both countries.DAGHER: Dennis, what percentage of your portfolio now is in cash and have you increased that and also, what's your read on precious metals like gold?GARTMAN: Well, first of all, I'm quite bullish of the precious metals -- I've been bullish of gold for quite some period of time. I'd really like to see gold get above 15 20, that will be a breakout to the upside and I'll add to my gold position. Gold is probably 30 or 40 percent of what I own which is probably a little too much for the average American to have. But I'm quick to take losses, I'm quick to get out if something should turns against me.As far as cash is concerned, the rest of my stuff is in bonds, corporate debt and I hedge it with derivatives. So actually if you want to say cash, I'm probably a hundred percent cash because I'm not -- I'm equally net long and net short, my net exposure to the stock market is relatively minimal at best.BARTIROMO: So we're heading into the third quarter earnings reporting season, are there anything in the charts that you see that indicate performance ahead? I know you look at technical in terms of charts.GARTMAN: Yes, I look at technical rather substantively. And it bothers me that if you look at the Dow, if you look at the S&P, if you look at the Russell two -- 5000 or whatever. Well, almost whatever index you look at, you're getting what the technicians call a head and shoulders top which is formed over the course of the past several months.But more importantly as I said earlier, the fact that my international index has refused to make a new high since January of 2018 tells me that the internals are starting to turn down.And I watch the CNN, and I hate to put in a plug for another network but the CNN Fear and Greed Index is a really good index for the average American to take a look at. And it has been making consistently lower highs and lower lows and it's turning quite bearish.So I just think that one should be -- should be careful. Pros can be quietly modestly just a tad net short. The average investor should be -- it's still a bull market for him. He should be less long than he's been however.But for the pros, being short is not such a bad idea right here and I'm short marginally. And the operative word here is marginally. Remember, this is my own money at risk.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Dennis, it's Dagen McDowell. Have you done any work on market reactions to impeachment proceedings?GARTMAN: Well, having lived through two impeachment proceed -- well, actually --MCDOWELL: That's why I asked you, my friend.GARTMAN: It's not pretty. The -- what happened during the Nixon impeachment which never really got to impeachment itself was terrible. The Dow fell from a thousand six to 474 over the course of that what, 18 months of the entire impeachment proceedings.During the -- during the Clinton proceed -- impeachment, the market actually didn't do very badly at all but I continue to remember how long it dragged out in the Nixon affair. And this seems more like the Nixon affair than it does the Clinton affair.So quite honestly, there's nothing good that comes out of it. The best that you can say is that things won't get bad. The worst that you can say is things can get terrible.BARTIROMO: Any thoughts on the Fed cutting rates in a week and-a-half or two weeks and what about the earnings period? What are you expecting?GARTMAN: If I were the -- if I were a voter on the Fed, I would probably vote not to cut rates. I think however, that there's probably going to be a slight majority for cutting rates. Certainly we'll probably get a 25 basis point cut before the end of the year. The question shall be, will we get 25 in the next week and 25 in December --BARTIROMO: We got the minutes yesterday -- we got the minutes from the September meeting yesterday when the central bank approved the quarter point reduction. And those minutes showed that investors are expecting the rate cut. But there's real division within the Fed.GARTMAN: And I don't mind that. I don't mind having the Fed arguing one with the other. That doesn't -- that doesn't bother me even much at all. But the fact was, there's a great deal of dissension. The beige book was relatively inconsequential. The minutes were terribly inconsequential.And I'm not -- I don't find it detrimental to find divisions within the FOMC. In fact, I rather like it. It shows they have -- we have individuals looking at their own data and making a decision and I think that the Fed chairman will do a fine job of keeping -- making -- finding some sort of consensus.Do I think that they'll end up cutting rates? Yes, I do. 25 basis points. But as I said, if I were the -- if I were on the FOMC, I'd be a dissenter and vote no.BARTIROMO: All right, Dennis, great to talk with you. Thank you so much.GARTMAN: Thanks, Maria. Good to be on your show.BARTIROMO: And to you, Dennis Gartman joining us there.Coming up, standardize test, sigh of relief. More colleges ditching the traditional requirement.Plus, navigating the competition, the CEO of Waze weighing in on how his company is racing to catch Uber and Lyft. That's coming up. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Major changes to college acceptances following the massive college admissions scandal. Cheryl Casone with headlines now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Probably this was coming, Maria. A growing number of colleges are no longer looking for SAT and ACT test scores. One in four schools have now dropped the admission requirement in the wake of the Varsity Blues scandal. And this is happening as the ACT has announced students who have already taken the entire exam can retake specific sections, instead of taking it all over again.Facebook's CEO soon going to be back on the hot seat in Washington. Mark Zuckerberg is going to be returning to Capitol Hill October 23rd to testify before a House panel about the Libra cryptocurrency project.Now, the proposal has been sharply criticized by lawmakers in the U.S. and actually around the world after a string of privacy lapses at Facebook.Steve Wozniak speaking out about government regulation of cryptocurrencies by the way. According to the Bloomberg, the Apple co-founder says countries will only want control as digital currencies grow in popularity.And then Maria, you're going to love this one. Sully, former President George H. W. Bush's service dog has received the Public Service Award from the ASPCA. It is given to an animal or officer who demonstrates a commitment to their career. Sully was at the former president's side from 2018 until his death and actually beyond, as you can see by the casket there.Sully now serves injured veterans and their families, Maria. We've talked about this before. He's working and I think very hard at Walter Reed Medical Center.BARTIROMO: That's a beautiful story.CASONE: I love Sully.BARTIROMO: Beautiful. Thanks, Cheryl.MCDOWELL: So I have a service dog story really quickly. Jennifer Williams who was Dana Perino's producer here, she trained a service dog, Spike, in the building. And now he's in like doggy college. But she works with Canine Companions, CCI Canine and one of the new puppies is named after Tyrus. They named a puppy after Tyrus. I think that was Dana's doing.But again, if you follow CCI Canines, any of the service dog organizations that raise these animals for veterans and other people in need, it's really -- they're really uplifting stories. Better than Ellen and G -- and G. W. Bush having a little love fest. Dogs are much better than humans.BARTIROMO: I love that.FREEMAN: Also, he got into doggy college on the merits, there was no corruption.DAGHER: That's right.FREEMAN: Blaming that -- blaming the SAT and the ACT is absolutely the worst response here. I understand why colleges don't want to face the corruption inside their institutions, they want to point the just but this is the benchmark and if you need to work on security to make sure someone actually took the test, that's fine. But this is how you get away from all of this insider connections stuff is you have a benchmark everyone has to meet.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: Wake Forest where I went and where one of your children goes, Wake Forest though waived the requirement a while ago. There are a lot of universities that don't require you to take the test.FREEMAN: They should bring it back.BARTIROMO: Quick break and then competing with Uber and Lyft, I'll be speaking with the Waze CEO next. The company is facing some stiff competition but it's doing well. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Waze, the popular app that helps users report and avoid traffic in real-time has for the past year been creating car pools across the country and across the world.My next guest knows all about that and dealing with the competition. Joining me right now is the CEO of Waze, Noam Bardin. Noam, it's great to have you on the program this morning. Thank you so much for being here.NOAM BARDIN, CEO, WAZE: Thank you for having me. Good morning.BARTIROMO: Congratulations to you, I love the app. I know that people love it who drive and use it. So it's certainly been real successful even though you've got competition left and right. Tell us about the evolution and growth of Waze and how many users you have today?BARDIN: So Waze is always an about improving your daily commute and traffic. And traffic really is the ill of modern life. I mean, it's terrible for your health, it's terrible for the economy, it's terrible globally, 30 percent of the emissions come from traffic.And that was our mission from day one. And we started by optimizing existing infrastructure, right. Those short cuts that we used to find you with Waze and still are kind of known for are also a way of using more roads that up and now have not been used, right.So we've finished optimizing the roads and now the second phase of our business, we're moving into carpooling. We're looking into your car. You've got four empty seats in your car. 75 percent of Americans commute alone. And so by allowing some of our drivers to leave their car at home once or twice a week and finding another driver who lives close to them, works close to them and allows them to take that ride, we can actually take cars off the road.And this is crucial because, yes, we all feel that traffic's getting worse. It is. Like we see it statistically. It's getting worse, what you're feeling is right. And no one's coming to save us. I mean, the government's not going to save us. Technology's not going to save us. We need to do something about this because we are traffic and we really are the problem.BARTIROMO: So are you up to 120 million users across the world? Tell us about the growth that you've seen, first off, since being acquired by Google. Just in that short period of time.BARDIN: So it's interesting. When we started talking to Google about the acquisition, we were doing 10 million active Wazers a month. Today we're about 130, we'll probably end the year around 140 million active Wazers globally. And so, we've seen huge growth since we joined Google and in general. And this is really kind of that special love that we have. People when they talk about Waze, they get a little smile on it because we really help them in one of their worst part of their day.BARTIROMO: Yes, because when you say active users, those people who are using the app but also contributing to it. You see a police car, you're putting that in. You see an accident, you're putting that in. The users are part of the experience.But tell me how you separate from Google Maps because I know that Google recently updated Google Maps with live -- with the live camera. A lot of people say Waze and Google Maps are a buried treasure for Alphabet. But how do you differentiate from Google Maps? Is it -- is it -- is that a partner or a competitor?BARDIN: So, Google Maps is about all your transportation needs, right. They have walking and they have public transit and riding and things like that. At the Waze, we only do driving. So we go really really deep on the driving experience.So every day when you go to work, you should be using Waze. When you're in France and don't know how to get somewhere, you should use Google Maps. And so, that focus for us really allows us to go deep. We know HOV lanes and the time it takes in HOV lanes. We know the tolls and how much it costs to go to the tolls. Like we can give all that granular data that you really need every day when you're commuting.BARTIROMO: How do you -- how do you protect people's privacy? Obviously with the Google Maps the camera is live. Your privacy, you know, you've got all of this information in there that is now accessible. How are you protecting people's privacy while doing all of this?BARDIN: So there's a big difference between a Google product and Waze. The Google actually owns and operating system which is Android. And so there are all kinds of constraints that come with that. We play by the rules of the app stores, the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store. And so we act like every other app that are constrained by the same rules as every other app.So if you don't want to share anything with us, turn us off, there's no problem. But when you use Waze, the deal is quid pro quo. When you drive with us, you give us the data where you are based on how fast you're going, we can warn other drivers whether or not to drive there. You report traffic. We tell it to the drivers behind you. So it's really a community effort.And the actual map is built by volunteers. We've got local volunteers more or less any city in the world who will update the map when a new road is opened, a new intersection. And this really gives them that hyper local feeling of how did Waze know that this intersection just show -- just opened up. Well, someone that lives there just actually made that change.BARTIROMO: Yes, but what about this data sharing program? I mean, here too the worries over privacy come up. Tell us about the new data sharing program.BARDIN: So Waze for cities is a program we've had for a while now. We have about 1,200 cities, partnered with transportation, municipalities connected to our platform. And we do is we share anonymous data that helps them plan their roads better.Again, our mission is really to fight traffic and cities are very important to end this. And so, we share data back and forth, they can a close segments on our side, if there's like a big parade or a marathon, we can tell them where there are accidents.And we have a lot of work around natural disasters, hurricanes, we will help show where to go. We'll close roads that are flooded. And it's really worked between volunteers, your elected officials and the Waze employees working together on this one platform.BARTIROMO: So, how do you see transportation in the future? I mean, you've got A.I. obviously out there and that is bringing up the subject of driverless cars. Tell me how you see the transportation industry in general changing, let's call it in the next 20 to 50 years.BARDIN: Well, I think there's three main trends going on. One really is electrification as cars move from fuel to electricity. The second really is transportation as a service, not owning a car but leasing a car when you need it or a car with a driver. And so -- and the third change is really the ability to have autonomy in the car that is driving by itself.So these changes are usually plumped together but they're very, very separate. We're focused very much on transportation as a service. What we feel is that since we have multiple people driving alone the same place, if we could get them to share their car, right, we can actually make a change. (INAUDIBLE) they don't need to own two cars in your family, if we could bring it down to one car family, we've done our bid.BARTIROMO: Noam, how are you going to -- how are you going to monetize this? Are you going to -- is there going to be a spinout of Waze at some point out of Google?BARDIN: There's no plan to spin Waze out of Google. Right now we're not monetizing the service. And we have to actually subsidize the service to create density. If you have enough people riding and driving together to deliver --Load-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

China Cold Chain Logistics Industry Report, 2019-2025 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireSeptember 2, 2019 Monday 6:02 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1033 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "China Cold Chain Logistics Industry Report, 2019-2025" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.Cold chain logistics is developing apace in China as cold chain for food is increasingly needed due to the accelerating process of urbanization and the changes in residents' diet structure, whilst local Chinese governments are sparing no efforts in constructing cold chain infrastructure.Chinese cold chain logistics market was worth RMB295.6 billion in 2018 with an upsurge of 18.8% from a year earlier, and it will keep expanding and soar to RMB522.5 billion in 2025 with an expected CAGR of 8.5% between 2018 and 2025 as the cold chain standards and policy grow clear, the fresh food e-commerce burgeons and financial innovations continue.Robust demand for cold chain logistics comes largely from five agricultural products including meat, aquatic product, quick-frozen food, fruits & vegetables, and dairy products, among which cold chain for fruits and vegetables is the segment of the largest size; there is also a rapidly growing demand for a cold chain for aquatic products. The two types of products will hold ever-larger market shares with the maturity of cold chain technologies. What's more, cold chain for medicine is gathering momentum, particularly for vaccines, blood products and diagnostic reagents.Competition in cold chain logistics:• Logistics operation: most players are engaged in both cold storage operation and cold chain transportation, like Xianyi Holding, Swire Cold Chain Logistics, and ZM Logistics. Not only have they huge cold storage capacity, but their transportation power is quite competitive.• Cold storage operation: Chinese cold storage market is scattered with a low concentration ratio and with strong regional attributes. In 2018, the top 10 cold storage operators had a total cold storage capacity of 30.89 million, commanding roughly 21.0% market shares, and the typical ones like Xianyi Supply Chain, Swire Cold Chain Logistics, and China Merchants Americold, all of which boast large cold storage network across China.The report highlights the following:• Overview of cold chain logistics industry (definition, classification, composition structure, industrial chain, market features, business model, policies, etc.)• Chinese cold chain logistics market (market size, market demand, competitive landscape, market structure, development prospects and development in key regions in the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region)• Cold chain market segments including fruits & vegetables, meat, quick-frozen rice and flour products, aquatic products, dairy products, and medicine (market features, demand, etc.)• Cold storage market (overview, overall capacity, regional analysis, competitive pattern and predictions)• 22 Cold chain operators (profile, performance, revenue structure, cold chain business, development strategy, etc.)Key Topics Covered1.

Hawley advises closure of Confucius InstituteThe Journal: Webster UniversitySeptember 18, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 859 wordsByline: Hanna HolthausBodyHanna Holthaus | September 18th, 2019Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wrote a letter to Webster this summer cautioning the school against continuing relations with the Confucius Institute.This summer, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley wrote letters to Webster University and the University of Missouri. The Congressman cautioned the universities in regard to the schools' Confucius Institutes and urged reconsideration of a Chinese government presence on both campuses.  Webster established its Confucius Institute in 2008, adding to the 89 universities across the U.S. to create such a program according to the National Association of Scholars. In a response to Hawley, President Beth Stroble released a statement solidifying the relationship between the school and the program. She said she had no plans to cut ties.President Donald Trump look on as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) speaks during Trump's "Make America Great Again" rally in Cape Girardeau, Missouri on Nov. 4, 2018. Photo by Christine Tannous. According to the Confucius Institute Headquarters, the program exists to educate people of all ages about Chinese culture through language classes and events. The program operates as a partnership between Webster, the Beijing Language and Culture University and the Office of Chinese Language Council International of the Chinese Ministry of Education (HANBAN.) Hawley vocalized concerns regarding the safety of the institute's presence in his letter, dated July 24. He said it posed threats to national security and spread Chinese propaganda. "These Confucius Institutes are, in short, a tool for China to spread influence and exercise soft power in its rivalry with the United States," Hawley said. The Webster Confucius Institute director, Patty Li, declined to comment on the matter. She referred to Stroble's letter to Hawley and said she wanted to move past the issue. The letter came after three universities closed their institutes earlier this year. San Francisco State University, University of Oregon and Western Kentucky University all ceased Confucius Institute operations in April. Their reasons for doing so included a 2018 law prohibiting schools from operating such programs if it also received funds from the Defense Department-funded Chinese Language Flagship program. Fifteen universities have closed institutes over the past two years, though not all cited the new law. Hawley said in his letter he believed a Chinese government funded program threatened academic freedom. The American Association of University Professors has spoken out with similar concerns. Kelly-Kate Pease works at Webster as an international relations professor. In 2008, she taught in China for eight weeks and said she gained a look into how academic freedoms could be slighted. Pease said she expected full operations of the library and Internet access in China, but both were censored. Her students could not always do research for their projects because of restrictions. Even though problems existed, Pease said interacting with others can bring forth positive aspects for everyone involved. "You might want to engage and maybe you can change China, right?" Pease said. "Maybe you can have a good influence on them, and you might learn something from them as well. There's always reasons to engage, but there are issues related to academic freedom."Stroble assured Hawley of the institute's place on campus, saying the university values academic freedom, diversity and cultural education. The University of Missouri's reply said the school would investigate Hawley's claim before making a decision regarding the status of the institute. "We take academic freedom very seriously and will not sacrifice it for any relationship," Stroble said. "Our relationship with HANBAN expressly reserves for Webster University the right to determine the curricula and the manner of instruction for all programs that we offer. Nothing in our agreements concerning the Confucius Institute restricts us from addressing any academic subject." Despite Pease's experiences, she believes Webster made the right decision, choosing not to allow Hawley to dictate the school's decisions. She said the government should not interfere in matters of private schools and saw the actions as inappropriate. Pease also, however, said the University of Missouri's "neutral" response permitted an opportunity for investigation."That's kind of ironic that you'd have concerns about the Confucius Institute interfering with the academic freedom at a university and then our own government doing the same thing," Pease said. Pease suspected the current trade negotiations between the U.S. and China increased Hawley's urgency in the matter. She said his relationship and support of Donald Trump affected his judgement. Hawley concluded his letter reaffirming his position and offering his aid. "I respectfully and strongly urge you to reconsider the costs and risks that come with allowing a Confucius Institute to remain on your campus, and with entering any other agreements with the Chinese government," Hawley said. "My office stands ready to assist you and to address and questions or concerns. Load-Date: September 19, 2019End of Document

House Homeland Security Committee Issues Testimony From DHS on Initiatives to Secure Supply ChainTargeted News ServiceOctober 16, 2019 Wednesday 7:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3929 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Homeland Security Committee issued the following testimony by Robert Kolasky, director of the National Risk Management Center of the Homeland Security Department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, at a hearing entitled "Public-Private Initiatives to Secure the Supply Chain":"Thank you for today's opportunity to testify regarding the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) ongoing efforts to secure the supply chain of information and communications technology (ICT). Thanks to Congress's leadership and passage of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-278) nearly one year ago today. CISA is now even better poised to achieve our important critical infrastructure security and resilience mission.Understanding the Threat"Cyber threats remain one of the most significant strategic risks for the United States, threatening our national security, economic prosperity, and public health and safety. We have seen advanced persistent threat actors, including hackers, cyber criminals, and nation-states, increase the frequency and sophistication of their attacks. In a 2018 report, Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace, the U.S.'s National Counterintelligence and Security Center stated, "We anticipate that China, Russia, and Iran will remain aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace." Our adversaries have been developing and using advanced cyber capabilities in attempts to undermine critical infrastructure, target our livelihoods and innovation, steal our national security secrets, and threaten our democratic institutions."During his annual Worldwide Threat Assessment testimony before Congress this January, the Director of National Intelligence stated, "China presents a persistent cyber espionage threat and a growing attack threat to our core military and critical infrastructure systems. China remains the most active strategic competitor responsible for cyber espionage against the US Government, corporations, and allies." The Director further stated, "We are also concerned about the potential for Chinese intelligence and security services to use Chinese information technology firms as routine and systemic espionage platforms against the United States and allies." This assessment is consistent with the fact that Chinese laws on national security and cybersecurity provide the Chinese government with a legal basis to compel technology companies operating in China to cooperate with Chinese security services."Increasingly, many or most discussion around cybersecurity threats include some risk calculation around supply chain, third party, or vendor assurance risk. In fact, a 2018 Symantec report detailed that the number of observed supply chain attacks was 78 percent higher in 2018 than it was in 2017, as malicious actors sought to exploit vulnerabilities in third-party software, hardware, and services."Supply Chain Risk can broadly be understood as efforts by our adversaries to exploit ICT technologies and their related supply chains for purposes of espionage, sabotage, and foreign interference activity. Vulnerabilities in supply chains - either developed intentionally for malicious intent or unintentionally through poor security practices - can enable data and intellectual property theft, loss of confidence in the integrity of the system, or exploitation to cause system and network failure. Increasingly, our adversaries are looking at these vulnerabilities as a principal attack vector, and we are increasingly concerned with aggressive actions, by potential foreign adversaries to include Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.Roles and Responsibilities"CISA, our government partners, and the private sector are all engaging in a more strategic and unified approach towards improving our nation's overall defensive posture against malicious cyber activity. In May of 2018, the Department published the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy, outlining a strategic framework to execute our cybersecurity responsibilities during the next five years. The National Cyber Strategy, released in September 2018, reiterates the criticality of collaboration and strengthens the government's commitment to work in partnership with industry to combat cyber threats and secure our critical infrastructure. Together, the National Cyber Strategy and DHS Cybersecurity Strategy guide CISA's efforts."CISA works across government and critical infrastructure industry partnerships to lead the national effort to safeguard and secure cyberspace. We share timely and actionable classified and unclassified information as well as provide training and technical assistance. Our work enhances cyber threat information sharing between and among governments and businesses across the globe to stop cyber incidents before they occur and quickly recover when they do. By bringing together the intelligence community, law enforcement, the Department of Defense, Sector-Specific Agencies, all levels of government, the private sector, international partners, and the public, we are enabling collective defense against cybersecurity risks, improving our incident response capabilities, enhancing information sharing of best practices and cyber threats, strengthening our resilience, and facilitating safety."In addition to our cross-sector leadership role, CISA is the Sector-Specific Agency for numerous sectors, notably the Information Technology and Communications Sectors. In this role, we work with a range of stakeholders to address both short-term and longer-term challenges regarding risks to telecommunications networks, including supply chain risk management and 5G security. These stakeholders include the Department of Justice, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Federal Communications Commission, General Services Administration, the intelligence community, and the private sector."Reducing ICT supply chain risk is a national security imperative and one that is a key pillar of CISA's Strategic Intent. While many components of CISA play some role in supporting supply chain initiatives, the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) leads the agency-wide supply chain coordination effort - providing program management and analytical support to current lines of effort. These include:*The ICT Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force*ICT analysis in support of Executive Order 13873: Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain*5G mobile communications security and resilience efforts"CISA's supply chain risk management efforts are closely integrated with the agency's broader critical infrastructure protection mission. Supply chain risk cuts across many of the 55 National Critical Functions released by CISA in April, and the National Critical Functions framework continues to be an effective platform for holistically understanding and prioritizing risk to our nation's critical infrastructure.ICT Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force"In 2018, CISA established the Information and Communication Technology Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force as a public-private partnership jointly chaired by CISA and the chairs of the IT and Communications Sector Coordinating Councils. The Task Force is working to identify and manage risks to the global ICT supply chain and is comprised of 40 industry partners from the IT and Communications Sectors and 20 interagency partners from the United States Government."The first year of the Task Force focused on four priority areas of policy concern for supply chain risk management, including: Information Sharing, Threat Evaluation, Qualified Bidder Lists and Qualified Manufacture Lists, and Policy Recommendations to Incentive Purchase of ICT from Original Equipment Manufacturers and Authorized Resellers."In September of this year, the Task Force released an Interim Report providing a status update on activities and objectives of the Task Force. The report outlines the overall structure of the Task Force as well as the four Working Groups, areas of discussion, and relevant key findings. The Interim Report serves as an important building block for the second year of the Task Force, including strategic priorities and recommendations."Among these priorities is enhancing the information sharing about supply chain risks with a particular focus on potential bad actors. The Task Force identified current gaps in the ability of government to collect relevant information on bad actors, the ability to use that information as part of an overall evaluation of trusted vendors, and the ability for that information to be shared with the private sector. Crucially, the Task Force also identified limitations on private-to-private information sharing on supply chain risks because of lingering legal concerns. Going forward, the Task Force is establishing a Working Group of lawyers from industry and government to address these hurdles and make recommendations for legal and regulatory changes; in addition, the Task Force is likely to identify the necessary components of an enhanced information sharing environment that can take advantage of factors that contribute to understanding as to whether vendors can be trusted."Another effort of the Task Force will be related to taking the output of a list of the Threat Evaluation Working Group - which identified nine types of supply chain threats and related scenarios - and making recommendations as to how the identified threats and threat scenarios can inform risk management programs for government agencies, and large and small businesses alike. These threats - whether from counterfeit parts, insider threats, poor cybersecurity practices, or market forces - need to be accounted for in effective supply chain risk management programs."In addition, to its Working Groups, the Task Force has emerged as a key private sector touch point for the recently launched Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC). All agencies participating in the FASC also have representatives on the Task Force - a deliberately designed synergy. And, we recently completed an agency-wide data call for the FASC and the Task Force that identified supply chain risk management programs from across government for the purpose of increasing integration and synchronization of efforts across the Executive Branch.ICT Criticality Analysis"On May 15, 2019, the President signed Executive Order (EO) 13873: Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain. This EO declares a national emergency with respect to the threat posed by foreign adversaries to the nation's information and communications technology supply chain. Specifically, the EO addresses concerns that "foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services, which store and communicate vast amounts of sensitive information, facilitate the digital economy, and support critical infrastructure and vital emergency services, in order to commit malicious cyber-enabled actions, including economic and industrial espionage against the United States.""DHS, specifically CISA, plays a key role in EO 13873. Section 5(b) requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to "asses and identify entities, hardware, software, and services that present vulnerabilities in the United States that pose the greatest potential consequences to the national security of the United States." The Secretary of DHS, in coordination with sector-specific agencies and coordinating councils as appropriate, was required to submit an assessment within 80 days of issuance of the EO and annually thereafter. The assessment was required to include an "evaluation of hardware, software, or services that are relied upon by multiple information and communications technology or service providers, including the communication services relied upon by critical infrastructure entities identified pursuant to section 9 of Executive Order 13636.""The Secretary of DHS delegated this responsibility to CISA. To carry out this responsibility, CISA has engaged with its federal and private sector partners to provide assessments of ICT hardware, software, and services to determine which pose the greatest threats and vulnerabilities to US critical infrastructure."CISA will soon release the methodology it used in its assessment in support of the EO. The methodology includes a deconstruction of the ICT supply chain into 61 elements - the hardware, software, and services "building blocks" - that collectively make up the ICT ecosystem. CISA hopes that this elemental deconstruction will have lasting value for supply chain risk management activity beyond this EO."Among the elements that CISA designated as critical for focusing supply chain risk reduction efforts were Home Subscriber Services, Mobile Switching Centers, and Sensitive Systems Software (to include software defined networking). Untrustworthy equipment in those supply chains could create an unacceptable amount of risk to the national security of the United States. There would likely be significant regional or national impacts, including affecting operations and the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data or the system, and the ability to effectively mitigate these risks is uncertain or unsatisfactory.5G"With that finding in mind, DHS - and our interagency partners - recognize 5G deployment as a significant area for national and economic security intention. The Fifth Generation Communications Network (5G) is the next generation of wireless technology that represents a complete transformation of telecommunication networks. Combining new and legacy technology and infrastructure, 5G will build upon previous generations in an evolution that will occur over many years, utilizing existing infrastructure and technology."From my perspective, 5G is the single biggest critical infrastructure build that the globe has seen in the last 25 years and, coupled with the growth of cloud computing, automation, and future of artificial intelligence, demands focused attention today to secure tomorrow."5G builds upon existing telecommunication infrastructure by improving the bandwidth, capacity, and reliability of wireless broadband services. The evolution will take years, but the goal is to meet increasing data and communication requirements, including capacity for tens of billions of connected devices that will make up the Internet of Things (IoT), ultra-low latency required for critical near-real time data transmission, and faster speeds to support emerging technologies. As of June 2019, 5G networks and technologies are in development with a limited rollout in select cities around the world, including 20 in the United States."DHS, working with its interagency and industry partners, has an opportunity to help shape the rollout of this emerging critical infrastructure, increasing its security and resilience at the design phase and reducing national security risk from an untrustworthy 5G network. Our intent in doing so is to promote the development and deployment of a secure and resilient 5G infrastructure that enables enhanced national security, technological innovation, and economic opportunity for the United States and its allied partners."Our work in this area will be focused on six lines of effort, to include:*Support the design and deployment of 5G networks with security and resilience in mind, to include investing in Research &#38; Development*Promote 5G use cases that are secure and trustworthy*Identify and communicate risks - including supply chain risks - to 5G infrastructure*Promote development and deployment of trusted 5G components*Advance the United States' global effort to influence direction of allied nations in 5G deployments*Provide leadership role within USG to coordinate operational 5G security and resilience efforts"The analogy of the space race is not entirely incorrect for 5G deployment, but I view it more as a competition between differing views of the world - one in which technology is deployed that protects the values of privacy, enables greater confidence amongst citizenry in essential services, and creates greater connectivity and economic opportunity while not undermining the ability of countries and communities to protect themselves; and, one that views technology as an enabler of illegitimate behavior."The United States' goal needs to be to do whatever we can to lead the world to the former vision. Industry will be a partner in all of this effort - so, too, will like-minded countries. One particular focus needs to be on ensuring that state-influenced entities do not dominate a market through unfair business practices and to potentially do the work of adversary action. As such, a particular concern that the Department of Homeland Security is focusing on regards the growing presence of Chinese telecom equipment in the Radio Access Network (RAN) portion of the network where there are a limited number of RAN equipment suppliers. There are five main purveyors of 5G RAN technology globally, the largest of which is Chinese-based. If Chinese manufacturers continue to gain market share, there will be growing concern about the long-term viability of the existing supply chain for 5G and successor technologies. As such, it is important for the U.S. and its allies to continue to promote market dynamism and support existing trusted-vendors in the space while investing in innovation and research and development that will help the trusted community win the quality battle in the RAN, innovate to a future 5G, and compete on a level playing field in the market. This is particularly necessary to help support deployment across the United States, including in rural communities.DHS Advisory Councils"CISA is working through the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) structure to engage with private sector stakeholders, especially the Communications and Information Technology Sector Coordinating Councils and the Enduring Security Framework Operations Working Group to collaborate on the risk posed by 5G technologies."CISA operates the Communications Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), a partnership of 11 federal agencies and over 60 private sector communications and information technology companies. Some of these companies maintain a permanent presence in CISA's operations center. Through the Communications ISAC, government and industry exchange vulnerability, threat, intrusion, and anomaly information. CISA also uses this mechanism to maintain situational awareness regarding the evolution of 5G standards and carrier 5G plans."The President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), created in 1982, provides industry-based analyses and recommendations to the President and the Executive Branch regarding policy and enhancements to national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications. It is composed of up to 30 presidentially appointed senior executives who represent various elements of the telecommunications industry. NSTAC is supported by the Secretary of Homeland Security, who is the Executive Agent."NSTAC has reviewed 5G security issues, including when it finalized its NSTAC Report to the President on Emerging Technologies Strategic Vision on July 14, 2017. The report included recommendations on how the government can adapt to "unprecedented growth and transformation in the technology ecosystem over the next decade," including 5G technology, which the NSTAC identified as a near-term transformative technology."The NSTAC is currently examining technology capabilities that are critical to NS/EP functions in the evolving ICT ecosystem. On April 2, 2019, the NSTAC submitted a letter to the President outlining the first phase of its study to identify the technologies within the ICT ecosystem that are most critical to the Government's NS/EP functions, which include 5G, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence."During the second phase of this study, the NSTAC plans to examine how certain dependencies, market limitations, and supply chain risks began, using the deployment of 5G technologies as a case study. The NSTAC will formulate recommendations for the recommended national innovation NS/EP ICT strategy. This strategy will ensure that the United States is more resilient, has access to trusted technology to support its NS/EP mission, and leads in the development and use of ICT technology.Research and Development"The next age of digital transformation depends on the success of the United States' national and global 5G build out. Significant research remains to be done in this area as well as hardening of the 5G network protocols, which are currently in early development. On April 22, 2019, DHS's Science and Technology Directorate and CISA announced an effort related to the development of new standards to improve the security and resilience of critical mobile communications networks. This solicitation established a research and development project for innovative approaches and technologies to protect legacy, current, and 5G mobile network communications services and equipment against all threats and vulnerabilities."The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union (ITU) lead the global 5G standards development initiatives. CISA currently works with industry, including nationwide US wireless carriers, in preparing technical standards for the standards development organizations to ensure Public Safety and NS/EP personnel will have priority communications services on 5G networks.Conclusion"In the face of increasingly sophisticated threats, CISA employees stand on the front lines of the Federal Government's efforts to defend our Nation's federal networks and critical infrastructure. The threat environment is complex and dynamic with interdependencies that add to the challenge. As new risks emerge, we must better integrate cyber and physical risk in order to effectively secure the Nation. CISA contributes unique expertise and capabilities around cyber-physical risk and cross-sector critical infrastructure interdependencies."A holistic understanding of critical infrastructure risk must take into account the supply chain risk stemming from an interconnected society that relies heavily on ICT technology as the supporting backbone of many National Critical Functions. As CISA continues to mature its engagement on supply chain risk management and 5G security and resilience lines of effort, the agency is also working on developing a lasting technological architecture and framework to allow for better structured supply chain risk analysis. We believe investing in this capability will be critical to fully achieving CISA's critical infrastructure mission in the years to come."I recognize and appreciate this Committee's strong support and diligence as it works to understand this emerging risk and identify additional authorities and resources needed to address it head on. We at CISA are committed to working with Congress to ensure our efforts cultivate a safer, more secure, and resilient Homeland through our efforts to defend today and secure tomorrow."Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee today, and I look forward to your questions."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6894007 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 17, 2019End of Document

The actively traded Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was down 0.4%.US stock futures were posting modest gains ahead of the opening bell, with investors weighing the latest batch of corporate earnings, as well as developments in Brexit and the US-China trade talks.Media reports said that China will boost its purchases of US farm products in exchange for the lifting of additional tariffs on $156 billion of Chinese goods that are set to be imposed in December. The Chinese government will make the request when Chinese Vice Premier Liu He has a call with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Friday. During the call, Beijing will also ask the US to remove the punitive duties that took effect Sept. 1, which cover $125 billion of Chinese goods.However, fresh worries over the resolution of the trade row resurfaced after US Vice President Mike Pence criticized China's human rights abuses. Pence stirred uncertainty on the trade front after his scathing remarks on China over human rights issues, even as Beijing and Washington were still ironing out a trade agreement.On the UK front, European Union leaders are considering a three-month "flexible" Brexit delay, a senior Downing Street source told Reuters.In economic data, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index will be out 10 am ET, with expectations for a reading of 96.0 in October, the same with the previous level. Meanwhile, the US Treasury will release its budget, with expectations for it to come in at $106.0 billion, compared with a deficit of $200.3 billion.Power Play: TechnologyTechnology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) was up 0.2% and other tech funds iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF (IYW) and iShares S&P North American Technology ETF (IGM) were inactive.Among semiconductor ETFs, SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) was flat and Semiconductor Sector Index Fund (SOXX) was up 0.7%.Intel (INTC) rose nearly 4% after it posted third-quarter results which sailed past analysts' estimates late on Thursday as the company's data-centric revenue propelled overall sales to a quarterly record for the technology major.  The PC-centric business's drop in revenue was attributed to lower year-on-year platform volume, partially offset by a mix of Intel's higher performance products as the company said that the commercial segment of the PC market remained strong. The company issued Q4 guidance that was shy of current Capital IQ consensus estimates.Winners and LosersFinancialSelect Financial Sector SPDRs (XLF) was flat, as were Daily Financial Bull 3X shares (FAS) and its bearish counterpart Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares (FAZ).Broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) rose marginally after it posted late Thursday in line Q3 revenue, even as earnings fell short of forecasts. The company's board approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.25 per common share on Nov. 21 to stockholders as of Nov. 7.IndustrialSelect Sector SPDR-Industrial (XLI) and iShares Trust Dow Jones U.S. Industrial Sector Index Fund (IYJ), and Vanguard Industrials (VIS) were quiet in pre-market trading.Lear (LEA), which manufactures automotive seating and electrical systems, reported Q3 top and bottom lines that exceeded Street expectations, even as both earnings and revenue declined year over year. The company attributed the sales drop to lower production and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. It also unveiled a lower 2019 guidance, mainly due to a labor strike at its largest customer.EnergyDow Jones US Energy Fund (IYE) was inactive and Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) was down 0.2% in pre-market trading.First Solar (FSLR) fell some 2% after posting late Thursday net profit and revenue that both missed Street projections, as they both decreased year over year. For the full year, the company reaffirmed its revenue guidance which straddled the consensus estimates from Capital IQ.CommoditiesCrude was down 0.1%; United States Oil Fund (USO) was up 0.2%. Natural gas was down 0.2%, and United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) was flat.Gold was up 0.2%, while SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) was up 0.2%. Silver up 1.7% and iShares Silver Trust (SLV) was up 1.7%.Health CareHealth Care SPDR (XLV) and other funds iShares Dow Jones US Healthcare (IYH), Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT) were inactive. iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (IBB) was also quiet.Biolase (BIOL) fell more than 15% after the medical device company said late Thursday it has priced an underwritten public offering of 7.8 million shares of its common stock at a price of $0.575 per share. The underwriters have been granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1.2 million shares of common stock. Additionally, the company agreed to sell 69,565 unregistered shares of its convertible preferred stock to certain investors at a price of $57.50 per share.ConsumerConsumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP), iShares Dow Jones US Consumer Goods (IYK) and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) were all quiet.Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) was down 1% and retail funds SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) and Market Vectors Retail ETF (RTH) were inactive.Anheuser-Busch Inbev (BUD), the world's largest beer maker, forecast "moderate" growth in its full-year gross operating earnings as headwinds it faced in the third quarter were set to continue over the next three months. The company reported Q3 earnings and revenue that both missed Street estimates. Looking ahead to the full-year, the firm expects the cost of sales per hectoliter to rise in "mid-single digits". BUD shares fell some 8% in pre-market trading.Price: 299.79, Change: -0.63, Percent Change: -0.21Load-Date: October 26, 2019End of Document

"South Park" disappears from china's internet after critical episodeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 8, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 271 wordsBodyThe South Parkcartoon series, known for its irony and provocative character, had virtually disappeared on Tuesday from the internet in China, after the broadcast of an episode in which it mocked the crackdown on opponents politicians in the country.The latest chapter of this American series, which uses an absurd humor and sarcastic tone to address controversial issues, attacked American companies that are willing to do anything to make their mark in the Chinese market.The series described forced labour in a Chinese detention center and parodied companies that put their business interests first and give in to censorship.On Tuesday, when "South Park" was sought on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, and other pages, no results were obtained. Some streaming video pages referred to some episodes, but the chapters could not be seen.The incident coincides with the controversy caused by a tweet from a leader of the Houston Rockets basketball team on behalf of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters, which has provoked criticism from the Chinese government and threatens to hurt the NBA's business in Asian country.The NBA issued a statement regretting the release of the tweet from Daryl Morey, ceo of the Houston Rockets, but on Tuesday an NBA leader said that no forgiveness will be spoofed for the tweet, nor will player and manager statements be controlled.On Twitter, South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone presented China with some very ironic excuses. "Just like the NBA, we're happy to welcome Chinese censors into our homes and hearts. We also love money more than freedom and democracy," they said.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

The government will also end the shareholding caps on foreign investors, effective Dec. 1.Meanwhile, China Academy of Information and Communications Technology data showed that smartphone shipments of the country in September dropped 5.7% year over year to 34.7 million units, which accounted for 95.7% of China's overall mobile phone shipments.In company news, shares of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SHA:600000) rose nearly 3% as the lender secured 100 million yuan ($14.1 million) of investments from Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery (HKG:0564, SHA:601717).The amount takes the hydraulic support manufacturer's total investments in the bank's products to 560 million yuan.Load-Date: October 14, 2019End of Document

Apple denies it sends everyone's browser data to Chinese companyStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 15, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 497 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyThe Safari feature - dubbed "Fraudulent Website Warning" in iOS and macOS - is meant to enhance online security by cross-referencing URLs against a blacklist service provided by safe browsing providers such as Google and Tencent.Google, for instance, provides two different Safe Browsing APIs - a Lookup and an Update API, the former of which allows browsers to send URLs in plaintext to the Google Safe Browsing server to check their status. We are not sure whether Tencent can truly offer the same technology which Google's Safe Browsing technology offers."Safari receives a list of websites known to be malicious from Google, and for devices with their region code set to mainland China, it receives a list from Tencent", Apple said in a statement as quoted by the website CultofMac.In the wake of backlash about this practice, Apple released a statement that clarifies who it uses for itsFraudulent Website Warning, Tencent or Google.Apple did say though, that if a website is found to be fraudulent then the IP (Internet Protocol) address of a user's device is shared with theSafe Browsing providers.It isn't clear if Tencent collects any information outside of China. The data scrambling is created to prevent Google from learning the full website address as a way to protect your privacy.ABC News apologizes for airing fake Syria bombing footageIt refers to the Military Gun Shoot & Military Gun Show, a biannual event held at Knob Creek Gun Range in West Point, Kentucky. The network said it "regrets the error" and it pulled the footage as soon as "questions were raised about its accuracy".When Fradulent Website Warning is enabled,Safari will display a warning if the website you are visiting is a suspectedphishing attack...."But Tencent isn't Google", Green wrote.Which brings us back to Tencent. Tencent's version presumably works the same way, but only inside China.Apple was quick to allay user concerns this weekend after someone spotted that it was working with Chinese company Tencent to check its users' website requests for malicious URLs. Given its history of bowing to pressure from the Chinese government with regard to censorship, that isn't encouraging.Safari regularly receives a list of URL prefix hashes that apply to malicious sites. If your URL matches one on the list, you'll be shown a warning that you're navigating to a unsafe site. A browser could directly submit every link you click to be checked against Google's blacklist, which, in turn would create a pretty extensive log of a users internet activity linked to a particular IP address. While it has always been known that data was being sent to Google, no one is certain when Apple began also sending data to Tencent. Last week, it pulled a smartphone app used by pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.The process used bySafari'sFraudulent Website Warning is complex, lending itself to confusion.Apple CEO Tim Cook waves as he attends a talk at Tsinghua University in Beijing, Oct. 23, 2014.Load-Date: October 16, 2019End of Document

The price target hike is predicated on expectations for a continued rebound in consumer demand for video cards and a jump in sales of products to data center customers, who are expected to upgrade their systems in late 2019/early 2020.Shares of NVIDIA are up 40.0% since the end of 2018, but that strong gain masks significant volatility that the stock has had to endure in 2019. The company will face easier yr/yr comparisons starting with its Q3 report expected in mid-November, but a new challenge has emerged in the form of stiffer competition from AMD (AMD 29.40, +0.39, +1.4%), which can impact NVIDIA's pricing power.11:57NAT Tanker/Shipping stocks outperforming as industry rates continue to advance (3.08 +0.29)TNK +10.83%, NAT +10.57%, TNP +8.12%, TK +7.70%, DSSI +6.89%, ASC +5.78%, GLOG +5.74%, FRO +5.35%, DHT +4.65%, EURN +4.32%, SB +3.63%, GLOP +2.76%, GNK +2.44%, CPLP +2.21%, etc...This morning, Nordic American commented on the 'exceptionally strong tanker market':"[T]he international shipbroking firm of Clarkson Platou Research reported the largest week-on-week increase in the history of their freight index.

Presently the Suezmax spot market is reported to about $68,000/day, and rising. The NAT operating costs are about $8,000/day per ship. A seasonal upturn was already in the making. However, the additional combination of increased demand from refineries around the world ramping up their production to supply low sulphur fuels for 2020 and reduced supply of new vessels are important structural factors."Reuters coverage of shipping rates.

The latter is probably responsible for a portion of the former, yet other factors are also in play:A wait-and-see stance in front of the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China this week in Washington.Ongoing evidence of foreign economic struggles, which manifested themselves in a 0.6% m/m decline in German factory orders in August and a drop in the eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence Index for September to -16.8 from -11.1 in August.Reports that contract negotiations between General Motors (GM 34.71, -0.20, -0.6%) and the UAW have taken "a turn for the worse," which is raising residual concerns about manufacturing sector conditions and U.S. growth prospects.NEC Director Kudlow said a short time ago in a Fox News interview that the GM strike is not helping the economy; however, he also said China's mood seems to be a little better this week and that something positive happening this week is possible, although he doesn't want to make any predictions.The stock market was rebounding from opening losses when Mr. Kudlow made his remarks and continued that rebound effort after the remarks were made, even though his China trade talk angle has been heard before.In any event, the major indices are mixed amid a lack of conviction on the part of buyers and sellers who are likely cognizant that it will be a seesaw this week with respect to speculative trade talk outcomes.The Russell 2000 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%.10:21RNG RingCentral (+6%) extending Friday's breakout to new highs after becoming the exclusive provider of UCaaS solutions to Avaya (AVYA) (173.21 +9.91)The deal made RNG the exclusive provider of Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solutions to Avaya.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

Pfenex anticipates submitting the final study report to the FDA as early as the second half of October 2019 and believes that this completes the information package required by the FDA to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of PF708.06:09BOLD Audentes Therapeutics presents new positive data from ASPIRO; Continued significant and durable improvements in respiratory function (27.84 )Audentes Therapeutics announced new positive data from ASPIRO, the clinical trial evaluating AT132 in patients with X-Linked Myotubular MyopathyEfficacy - Patients receiving AT132 have achieved significant and durable reductions in ventilator dependence, an endpoint considered to be closely correlated with morbidity and mortality in XLMTM patients. To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired. S&P Futures are off by fifteen points, trading around the 2936 level. This comes after spoos put in a high of 2943.25 and a low of 2928.00.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong were closed. Chinese markets will re-open tomorrow after a week-long hiatus. In Japan, the Nikkei gave back about 0.2%, which is encouraging considering key heavyweights such as Honda and Panasonic closed about 1% lower. In Europe, the major bourses are down but having an uneventful session. Germany posted a weaker than expected Factory Orders figure for August that came in at -0.6%, after the market expected a fall of only 0.3%. This, and the early pressure in the US, has seemingly kept a lid on equity gains throughout the region.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -16.010 yr Note: 1.52%USD/JPY: 106.84 -0.06EUR/USD: 1.0971 -0.0005Europe: FTSE -0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng CLOSED Shanghai CLOSED Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1508.10 -4.80) Silver (17.50 -0.12) Crude (52.99 +0.18)18:02WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ENDP (3.82 +19.75%), ARQL (8.29 +18.43%), SRPT (88.25 +17.67%), CDNA (25.37 +16.22%), RGNX (38.49 +15.41%), ARWR (30.6 +13.5%)Materials: SBGL (6.36 +14.39%)Consumer Discretionary: TSG (20.92 +38.82%)Information Technology: RNG (163.3 +31.85%), AVYA (13.23 +28.45%), OKTA (116.53 +20.06%), COUP (148.32 +15.97%)Energy: TOO (1.53 +30.77%), DHT (6.88 +14.1%), STNG (33.65 +14.07%), FRO (10.28 +12.72%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: GTHX (23.34 -31.29%), LNTH (19.74 -22.04%), ANGO (14.6 -19.02%)Materials: SXC (5.31 -15.71%)Consumer Discretionary: GPRO (3.97 -21%), TAST (6.8 -16.46%)Information Technology: CASA (6.22 -20.47%)Financials: AMTD (33.7 -28.25%), ETFC (36.4 -15.87%)Energy: NBR (1.57 -18.65%), MDR (1.63 -18.5%), QEP (3.15 -17.54%), CDEV (3.8 -15.95%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (7.45 -34.76%), CALM (37.97 -16.4%)18:01NBIX Neurocrine Biosci presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia (89.73 -0.20)The analyses of pooled data from multiple long-term studies of the 40 mg dose showed that 53.7% of patients taking 40 mg of INGREZZA achieved an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) response (= 50% improvement from baseline) after 48 weeks of treatment. INGREZZA is available in two doses, 40 mg and 80 mg. Additionally, an analysis of the pivotal Phase III KINECT 3 data demonstrated that 50% of patients achieved an early response after two weeks of INGREZZA treatment (40 mg or 80 mg). Data also showed that meaningful long-term reductions in TD were achieved regardless of whether patients responded after two weeks.Neurocrine Biosciences also presented a post-hoc analysis of KINECT 3, the pivotal Phase III study, indicating that both the 40 mg and 80 mg doses of INGREZZA improved TD as early as two weeks in adults with TD, as measured by global clinician and patient scales.17:03ADMA ADMA Biologics files for $200 mln mixed securities shelf offering (4.14 -0.03)16:32ASR Grupo Aeroportuario Del Sureste reports that total passenger traffic for September increased 5.5% yr/yr (155.80 +2.21)Passenger traffic increased 2.0% in Mexico, 8.4% in Puerto Rico, and 12.1% in Colombia.16:23VRCA Verrica Pharmaceuticals CFO Chris Degnan to resign effective on October 18 (14.48 -0.31)Mr. Degnan's resignation did not result from a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices, including its controls or financial related matters.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

Today's price action has largely reflected a lack of conviction as trade speculation ramps up in front of key trade talks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) are little changed, too.Deputy-level trade talks are expected to continue today and tomorrow, with higher-level talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday. NEC Director Larry Kudlow said earlier today that China's "mood" seems to be a little better this week, somewhat muddling a Bloomberg story that suggested China is currently less interested in a complete deal that resolves key structural issues.Some have pointed to Mr. Kudlow's comments as a reason for the market's bounce from its lows this morning, yet there appears to be mixed signals from the trade-sensitive S&P 500 materials (+0.4%), industrials (-0.1%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors. The utilities sector (-0.4%) is today's laggard.Instead, today's price action appears to be driven in part by technical factors. At its low, the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average (2941) before buyers quickly stepped in on no specific news to lift it back above the key technical level and jump-start a move to session highs.Apple (AAPL 229.06, +2.05, +0.9%) remains in focus as it continues its ascent back toward all-time highs on no "new" news today. On a related note, Silicon Motion (SIMO 37.69, +1.84, +5.1%) raised its guidance following a report from last week that indicated Apple asked its suppliers to increase production for its iPhone 11.In other matters, labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.92, +0.10, unch) and the UAW took a "turn of the worse" over the weekend, but shares of GM have erased early losses. Mr. Kudlow commented on the situation, saying the strike is not helping the economy.U.S. Treasuries are pulling back from last week's advance, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up six basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.89. WTI crude is trading 1.8% higher at $53.74/bbl after a steep decline last week.12:49SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (8.27 mln -3.3%)Materials: CLF (9.07 mln +1.36%), FCX (8.85 mln +1.36%)Industrials: GE (16.29 mln -0.06%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (17.15 mln -6.79%), ROKU (13.48 mln -1.53%), F (10.45 mln -0.11%), M (9.05 mln +1.2%)Information Technology: AMD (20.69 mln +0.65%), AAPL (14.76 mln +0.84%), AVYA (9.56 mln +7.27%)Financials: BAC (16.01 mln +0.07%), ITUB (12.73 mln -2.73%), TQQQ (10.35 mln +0.26%)Energy: CHK (24 mln -0.74%), SWN (9.82 mln +0%), RIG (9.24 mln +1.65%), ECA (8.79 mln +0.79%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: AKCA (6.81x +29.25%), TAK (6.03x -0.12%), XENT (3.41x -11.26%), BLUE (2.36x -0.85%), DBVT (1.81x -4.6%)Consumer Discretionary: LIND (2.56x +1.38%)Information Technology: RNG (3.76x +6.58%), AVYA (3.49x +7.27%), SIMO (2.76x +4.9%), SPWR (2.15x -3.05%), PSDO (1.95x +0.15%), FSLR (1.86x -3.35%)Financials: PPR (2.08x +0%), NEWT (1.88x -1.82%)Energy: EURN (2.77x +4.47%), TGP (2.62x +1%), BPT (1.78x -7.59%)Consumer Staples: SMPL (5.52x -3.19%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: AKCA (19.56 +29.25%), GTS (14.85 +7.65%), CYH (4.1 +7.05%)Industrials: MAXR (8.07 +6.68%)Consumer Discretionary: ASNA (0.36 +13.54%), JCP (1.02 +10.7%), OSTK (11.14 +9%), SIG (17.63 +8.49%)Information Technology: AVYA (14.19 +7.27%), RNG (174.04 +6.58%)Energy: TK (4.04 +9.19%), HPR (1.35 +7.14%), ESV (4.56 +7.04%), MDR (1.74 +6.75%), TUSK (2.27 +6.57%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.25 +10.62%), RAD (8.18 +7.77%)Utilities: PCG (11.6 +6.67%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: XENT (15.06 -11.26%), RDUS (23.63 -8.23%), ADAP (1.12 -8.2%), ALLK (72.41 -6.39%), RCUS (8.24 -6.26%), SRPT (82.74 -6.24%), DBVT (8.5 -4.6%), EPZM (10.41 -4.32%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.09 -7.26%), NIO (1.51 -6.79%), PDD (31.16 -6.57%), GPRO (3.8 -4.41%)Information Technology: XELA (1.31 -5.07%)Financials: JEF (17.32 -5.87%), QD (6.49 -5.47%)Energy: BPT (8.16 -7.59%), HCLP (1.44 -5.59%), AR (2.75 -5.17%)Consumer Staples: FIZZ (46.43 -4.89%)12:46AAPL Apple (+1%) hits 52-week high, within 2% of last October's record high (229.34 +2.33)Apple hit a 52-week high today after breaking out on Friday following a report from the Nikkei Asian Review that the iPhone maker asked suppliers to boost production based on solid demand for the new lower end iPhone 11. Apple will report fiscal fourth quarter results on Wednesday, October 30.The $1.03 trln company trades at just over 18x forward EPS estimates, or ~16x netting out cash/debt.12:39AMTD TD Ameritrade releases monthly Investor Movement Index -- Retail investors decreased exposure to equity markets during September (33.82 +0.12)The Investor Movement Index (IMXSM) measured at 4.51 in September, down slightly from its August score. The IMX is TD Ameritrade's proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets.The reading for the four-week period ending Sept. 27, 2019 fell by 2 percent, continuing an 11-month trend of below-average IMX scores. Compared to historic averages, this score ranks "Moderately Low". Equity markets were mixed during September, with the S&P 500 moving higher by 1.2 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increasing by 1.6 percent. The Nasdaq Composite ended the period slightly lower, down 0.3 percent, as the technology sector lagged. Oil prices were volatile following an attack on a Saudi oil facility, posting the biggest one-day gain in more than a decade. The Federal Reserve also voted to cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points for the second time in two months.12:10MAXR Maxar Technologies Ltd outperforming after being awarded a $14.2 mln U.S. Air Force contract -- shares currently +6% (8.02 +0.46)This morning, the company said that it had been awarded a $14.2 mln contract to develop Red Wing, an automated, cloud-based geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) analysis architecture for the Air Force Research Laboratory.12:05SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Akcea Therapeutics (AKCA) gains on licensing agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersAKCA (20.13 +33.05%): Entered into worldwide exclusive licensing agreement for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigative antisense treatment designed for certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, with Pfizer (PFE); co and its majority owner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) will receive a $250 mln upfront license fee, to be split equally between the two; co will settle its $125 mln obligation to Ionis in Akcea common stock. The companies are also eligible for milestone payments of up to $1.3 bln and tiered royalties on sales following marketing approval. Upgraded to Outperform at Wells Fargo. LVGO (19.9 +14.9%): Co was awarded a contract to provided the Livongo for Diabetes solution to eligible members covered by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program who are living with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes under one health plan covering 5.3 mln federal employees, retirees, and their families; co anticipates that this agreement will push its membership adds for Livongo for Diabetes Members well above prior guidance, seeing approx. 25,000 adds in 2020, growing to approx. 45,000 in 2021; based on this updated enrollment, co expects the agreement to account for a total of $50-60 mln in revenue over the two-year span. OSTK (11.64 +13.89%): Continued volatility; the stock advances after opening the session at a slight loss.Small Cap LosersXENT (15.25 -10.16%): A study of co's ASCEND investigational drug-coated sinus balloon, in which the ASCEND product was randomized against an uncoated balloon control to evaluate whether it would reduce post-balloon dilation edema through localized steroid delivery directly to the dilated tissue, did not meet its primary endpoint of intra-patient comparison of frontal sinus patency grade at day 30. The ASCEND balloon did show statistically significant differences in several important secondary endpoints directly attributable to the drug, mometasone furoate, including reduction in inflammation and polypoid edema at all timepoints through day 30. Co, while disappointed with the primary endpoint result, "will continue to analyze the ASCEND study findings to inform [co's] clinical and regulatory strategy." At two-year lows.RDUS (23.61 -8.31%): Tracks to its lowest levels since August on above average volume. In recent sector events, Pfenex (PFNX) announced that it has received FDA approval for its NDA for PF708, indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture, with Forteo (teriparatide injection -- an Eli Lilly [LLY] product) as the reference drug. Co is also active in the osteoporosis space; its TYMLOS (abaloparatide) injection product is approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.ZYXI (11.48 -8.2%): The stock pulls back after establishing a new high in early trade, having at this morning's high gained circa +38% through the past week, bolstered by co's Q3 order growth statistics.12:04AXNX Axonics Modulation sells off 8% as Medtronic (MDT -1%) seeks approval for InterStim Micro neurostimulator and InterStim SureScan MRI leads (23.49 -2.04)This morning, Medtronic (MDT) announced it had filed a pre-market approval (PMA) supplement with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of its InterStim Micro neurostimulator and also its InterStim SureScan MRI leads. InterStim Micro is a rechargeable, implantable sacral neuromodulation (SNM) device to treat patients affected by overactive bladder, urinary urge incontinence, unobstructed urinary retention and fecal incontinence. The SureScan leads, which will be used in future implants of the recharge-free InterStim II system and rechargeable InterStim Micro system, are designed to provide full-body 1.5 and 3 Tesla MRI conditional labeling, pending FDA approval.This submission, pending regulatory approval from the FDA, would position the Company to achieve approval for the InterStim Micro system and SureScan MRI leads in the spring of 2020, following a standard 180-day review process.Axonics is commercializing implantable SNM devices for patients with urinary and bowel dysfunction. In September, the company received FDA approval for its Axonics r-SNM System, the first rechargeable SNM system approved for sale in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. The FDA approval grants Axonics the right to market its product in the United States for the clinical indication of fecal incontinence. The approval includes the claim of a 15-year functional life and the ability of patients to undergo full-body MRI scans without the necessity of having the device explanted.11:58NVDA NVIDIA eyes September high (186.74 +4.77)NVIDIA (NVDA 186.74, +4.77, +2.6%) has gotten off to a strong start in a subdued market, making a run at a five-month high (188.40) that was notched in mid-September.Today's advance has received assistance from RBC Capital Markets after the firm increased its price target for the stock to $217 from $190. The price target hike is predicated on expectations for a continued rebound in consumer demand for video cards and a jump in sales of products to data center customers, who are expected to upgrade their systems in late 2019/early 2020.Shares of NVIDIA are up 40.0% since the end of 2018, but that strong gain masks significant volatility that the stock has had to endure in 2019. The company will face easier yr/yr comparisons starting with its Q3 report expected in mid-November, but a new challenge has emerged in the form of stiffer competition from AMD (AMD 29.40, +0.39, +1.4%), which can impact NVIDIA's pricing power.11:57NAT Tanker/Shipping stocks outperforming as industry rates continue to advance (3.08 +0.29)TNK +10.83%, NAT +10.57%, TNP +8.12%, TK +7.70%, DSSI +6.89%, ASC +5.78%, GLOG +5.74%, FRO +5.35%, DHT +4.65%, EURN +4.32%, SB +3.63%, GLOP +2.76%, GNK +2.44%, CPLP +2.21%, etc...This morning, Nordic American commented on the 'exceptionally strong tanker market':"[T]he international shipbroking firm of Clarkson Platou Research reported the largest week-on-week increase in the history of their freight index. From Thursday to Friday last week, reported Suezmax rates jumped 60% on the day and 400% on the month! NAT's uniform fleet of 23 Suezmax tankers have 21 units trading in the open spot market, ready to benefit from strengthening freights.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/AOther news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019 metrics; net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 mln, from $243.7 mln in the prior year September period (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 mln, or 2.1%, vs the same prior year one-month September period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired. S&P Futures are off by fifteen points, trading around the 2936 level. This comes after spoos put in a high of 2943.25 and a low of 2928.00.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong were closed. Chinese markets will re-open tomorrow after a week-long hiatus. In Japan, the Nikkei gave back about 0.2%, which is encouraging considering key heavyweights such as Honda and Panasonic closed about 1% lower. In Europe, the major bourses are down but having an uneventful session. Germany posted a weaker than expected Factory Orders figure for August that came in at -0.6%, after the market expected a fall of only 0.3%. This, and the early pressure in the US, has seemingly kept a lid on equity gains throughout the region.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -16.010 yr Note: 1.52%USD/JPY: 106.84 -0.06EUR/USD: 1.0971 -0.0005Europe: FTSE -0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng CLOSED Shanghai CLOSED Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1508.10 -4.80) Silver (17.50 -0.12) Crude (52.99 +0.18)18:02WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ENDP (3.82 +19.75%), ARQL (8.29 +18.43%), SRPT (88.25 +17.67%), CDNA (25.37 +16.22%), RGNX (38.49 +15.41%), ARWR (30.6 +13.5%)Materials: SBGL (6.36 +14.39%)Consumer Discretionary: TSG (20.92 +38.82%)Information Technology: RNG (163.3 +31.85%), AVYA (13.23 +28.45%), OKTA (116.53 +20.06%), COUP (148.32 +15.97%)Energy: TOO (1.53 +30.77%), DHT (6.88 +14.1%), STNG (33.65 +14.07%), FRO (10.28 +12.72%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: GTHX (23.34 -31.29%), LNTH (19.74 -22.04%), ANGO (14.6 -19.02%)Materials: SXC (5.31 -15.71%)Consumer Discretionary: GPRO (3.97 -21%), TAST (6.8 -16.46%)Information Technology: CASA (6.22 -20.47%)Financials: AMTD (33.7 -28.25%), ETFC (36.4 -15.87%)Energy: NBR (1.57 -18.65%), MDR (1.63 -18.5%), QEP (3.15 -17.54%), CDEV (3.8 -15.95%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (7.45 -34.76%), CALM (37.97 -16.4%)18:01NBIX Neurocrine Biosci presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia (89.73 -0.20)The analyses of pooled data from multiple long-term studies of the 40 mg dose showed that 53.7% of patients taking 40 mg of INGREZZA achieved an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) response (= 50% improvement from baseline) after 48 weeks of treatment. INGREZZA is available in two doses, 40 mg and 80 mg. Additionally, an analysis of the pivotal Phase III KINECT 3 data demonstrated that 50% of patients achieved an early response after two weeks of INGREZZA treatment (40 mg or 80 mg). Data also showed that meaningful long-term reductions in TD were achieved regardless of whether patients responded after two weeks.Neurocrine Biosciences also presented a post-hoc analysis of KINECT 3, the pivotal Phase III study, indicating that both the 40 mg and 80 mg doses of INGREZZA improved TD as early as two weeks in adults with TD, as measured by global clinician and patient scales.17:03ADMA ADMA Biologics files for $200 mln mixed securities shelf offering (4.14 -0.03)16:32ASR Grupo Aeroportuario Del Sureste reports that total passenger traffic for September increased 5.5% yr/yr (155.80 +2.21)Passenger traffic increased 2.0% in Mexico, 8.4% in Puerto Rico, and 12.1% in Colombia.16:23VRCA Verrica Pharmaceuticals CFO Chris Degnan to resign effective on October 18 (14.48 -0.31)Mr. Degnan's resignation did not result from a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices, including its controls or financial related matters.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

Today's price action has largely reflected a lack of conviction as trade speculation ramps up in front of key trade talks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) are little changed, too.Deputy-level trade talks are expected to continue today and tomorrow, with higher-level talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday. NEC Director Larry Kudlow said earlier today that China's "mood" seems to be a little better this week, somewhat muddling a Bloomberg story that suggested China is currently less interested in a complete deal that resolves key structural issues.Some have pointed to Mr. Kudlow's comments as a reason for the market's bounce from its lows this morning, yet there appears to be mixed signals from the trade-sensitive S&P 500 materials (+0.4%), industrials (-0.1%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors. The utilities sector (-0.4%) is today's laggard.Instead, today's price action appears to be driven in part by technical factors. At its low, the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average (2941) before buyers quickly stepped in on no specific news to lift it back above the key technical level and jump-start a move to session highs.Apple (AAPL 229.06, +2.05, +0.9%) remains in focus as it continues its ascent back toward all-time highs on no "new" news today. On a related note, Silicon Motion (SIMO 37.69, +1.84, +5.1%) raised its guidance following a report from last week that indicated Apple asked its suppliers to increase production for its iPhone 11.In other matters, labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.92, +0.10, unch) and the UAW took a "turn of the worse" over the weekend, but shares of GM have erased early losses. Mr. Kudlow commented on the situation, saying the strike is not helping the economy.U.S. Treasuries are pulling back from last week's advance, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up six basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.89. WTI crude is trading 1.8% higher at $53.74/bbl after a steep decline last week.12:49SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (8.27 mln -3.3%)Materials: CLF (9.07 mln +1.36%), FCX (8.85 mln +1.36%)Industrials: GE (16.29 mln -0.06%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (17.15 mln -6.79%), ROKU (13.48 mln -1.53%), F (10.45 mln -0.11%), M (9.05 mln +1.2%)Information Technology: AMD (20.69 mln +0.65%), AAPL (14.76 mln +0.84%), AVYA (9.56 mln +7.27%)Financials: BAC (16.01 mln +0.07%), ITUB (12.73 mln -2.73%), TQQQ (10.35 mln +0.26%)Energy: CHK (24 mln -0.74%), SWN (9.82 mln +0%), RIG (9.24 mln +1.65%), ECA (8.79 mln +0.79%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: AKCA (6.81x +29.25%), TAK (6.03x -0.12%), XENT (3.41x -11.26%), BLUE (2.36x -0.85%), DBVT (1.81x -4.6%)Consumer Discretionary: LIND (2.56x +1.38%)Information Technology: RNG (3.76x +6.58%), AVYA (3.49x +7.27%), SIMO (2.76x +4.9%), SPWR (2.15x -3.05%), PSDO (1.95x +0.15%), FSLR (1.86x -3.35%)Financials: PPR (2.08x +0%), NEWT (1.88x -1.82%)Energy: EURN (2.77x +4.47%), TGP (2.62x +1%), BPT (1.78x -7.59%)Consumer Staples: SMPL (5.52x -3.19%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: AKCA (19.56 +29.25%), GTS (14.85 +7.65%), CYH (4.1 +7.05%)Industrials: MAXR (8.07 +6.68%)Consumer Discretionary: ASNA (0.36 +13.54%), JCP (1.02 +10.7%), OSTK (11.14 +9%), SIG (17.63 +8.49%)Information Technology: AVYA (14.19 +7.27%), RNG (174.04 +6.58%)Energy: TK (4.04 +9.19%), HPR (1.35 +7.14%), ESV (4.56 +7.04%), MDR (1.74 +6.75%), TUSK (2.27 +6.57%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.25 +10.62%), RAD (8.18 +7.77%)Utilities: PCG (11.6 +6.67%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: XENT (15.06 -11.26%), RDUS (23.63 -8.23%), ADAP (1.12 -8.2%), ALLK (72.41 -6.39%), RCUS (8.24 -6.26%), SRPT (82.74 -6.24%), DBVT (8.5 -4.6%), EPZM (10.41 -4.32%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.09 -7.26%), NIO (1.51 -6.79%), PDD (31.16 -6.57%), GPRO (3.8 -4.41%)Information Technology: XELA (1.31 -5.07%)Financials: JEF (17.32 -5.87%), QD (6.49 -5.47%)Energy: BPT (8.16 -7.59%), HCLP (1.44 -5.59%), AR (2.75 -5.17%)Consumer Staples: FIZZ (46.43 -4.89%)12:46AAPL Apple (+1%) hits 52-week high, within 2% of last October's record high (229.34 +2.33)Apple hit a 52-week high today after breaking out on Friday following a report from the Nikkei Asian Review that the iPhone maker asked suppliers to boost production based on solid demand for the new lower end iPhone 11.

The IMX is TD Ameritrade's proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets.The reading for the four-week period ending Sept. 27, 2019 fell by 2 percent, continuing an 11-month trend of below-average IMX scores. Compared to historic averages, this score ranks "Moderately Low". Equity markets were mixed during September, with the S&P 500 moving higher by 1.2 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increasing by 1.6 percent. The Nasdaq Composite ended the period slightly lower, down 0.3 percent, as the technology sector lagged. Oil prices were volatile following an attack on a Saudi oil facility, posting the biggest one-day gain in more than a decade.

A survival analysis using a time-dependent Cox regression model showed that the difference in probability of survival between treated patients and untreated natural history control patients was highly statistically significant (p<0.0006). In addition to the survival benefit, the vast majority of treated patients (94.7%) had either improved (68%) or stabilized (26%) responses in major functional domains. Among clinical responders, a subset demonstrated profound responses, in some cases re-acquiring previously lost motor milestones.Safety & TolerabilitySafety data from RETRO indicated that SET is generally safe and well-tolerated. Most reported adverse events were considered not related to study drug (199 of 292), with mild or moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event, occurring in 63% of patients.Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 14 subjects (37%). The majority of SAEs were deemed related to TK2d; two patients experienced three events related to study drug alone (kidney stone, kidney stone removal, diarrhea).Two adult-onset patients stopped treatment due to asymptomatic increases in aminotransferase liver enzymes (no increase in bilirubin levels), which resolved upon discontinuation of treatment.08:07WIRES On The WiresAllergan plc (AGN) announced the launch of three new over-the-counter REFRESH RELIEVA products: REFRESH RELIEVA, REFRESH RELIEVA PF (preservative-free) multidose, and REFRESH RELIEVA FOR CONTACTS.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/AOther news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019 metrics; net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 mln, from $243.7 mln in the prior year September period (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 mln, or 2.1%, vs the same prior year one-month September period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

There was also a statistically significant reduction in the need for oral steroid interventions at day 30, as determined by the independent reviewer. There were no adverse events related to the drug component of the ASCEND balloon, and no device-related serious adverse events observed in the study.07:00SUMRX Asian Markets Close: Nikkei -0.2%, Hang Seng CLOSED, Shanghai CLOSEDEquity indices in the Asia-Pacific region began the week on a mixed note while markets in China and Hong Kong were closed for holidays.

To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired. S&P Futures are off by fifteen points, trading around the 2936 level. This comes after spoos put in a high of 2943.25 and a low of 2928.00.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong were closed. Chinese markets will re-open tomorrow after a week-long hiatus. In Japan, the Nikkei gave back about 0.2%, which is encouraging considering key heavyweights such as Honda and Panasonic closed about 1% lower. In Europe, the major bourses are down but having an uneventful session. Germany posted a weaker than expected Factory Orders figure for August that came in at -0.6%, after the market expected a fall of only 0.3%. This, and the early pressure in the US, has seemingly kept a lid on equity gains throughout the region.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -16.010 yr Note: 1.52%USD/JPY: 106.84 -0.06EUR/USD: 1.0971 -0.0005Europe: FTSE -0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng CLOSED Shanghai CLOSED Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1508.10 -4.80) Silver (17.50 -0.12) Crude (52.99 +0.18)18:02WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ENDP (3.82 +19.75%), ARQL (8.29 +18.43%), SRPT (88.25 +17.67%), CDNA (25.37 +16.22%), RGNX (38.49 +15.41%), ARWR (30.6 +13.5%)Materials: SBGL (6.36 +14.39%)Consumer Discretionary: TSG (20.92 +38.82%)Information Technology: RNG (163.3 +31.85%), AVYA (13.23 +28.45%), OKTA (116.53 +20.06%), COUP (148.32 +15.97%)Energy: TOO (1.53 +30.77%), DHT (6.88 +14.1%), STNG (33.65 +14.07%), FRO (10.28 +12.72%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: GTHX (23.34 -31.29%), LNTH (19.74 -22.04%), ANGO (14.6 -19.02%)Materials: SXC (5.31 -15.71%)Consumer Discretionary: GPRO (3.97 -21%), TAST (6.8 -16.46%)Information Technology: CASA (6.22 -20.47%)Financials: AMTD (33.7 -28.25%), ETFC (36.4 -15.87%)Energy: NBR (1.57 -18.65%), MDR (1.63 -18.5%), QEP (3.15 -17.54%), CDEV (3.8 -15.95%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (7.45 -34.76%), CALM (37.97 -16.4%)18:01NBIX Neurocrine Biosci presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia (89.73 -0.20)The analyses of pooled data from multiple long-term studies of the 40 mg dose showed that 53.7% of patients taking 40 mg of INGREZZA achieved an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) response (= 50% improvement from baseline) after 48 weeks of treatment.

Additionally, an analysis of the pivotal Phase III KINECT 3 data demonstrated that 50% of patients achieved an early response after two weeks of INGREZZA treatment (40 mg or 80 mg). Data also showed that meaningful long-term reductions in TD were achieved regardless of whether patients responded after two weeks.Neurocrine Biosciences also presented a post-hoc analysis of KINECT 3, the pivotal Phase III study, indicating that both the 40 mg and 80 mg doses of INGREZZA improved TD as early as two weeks in adults with TD, as measured by global clinician and patient scales.17:03ADMA ADMA Biologics files for $200 mln mixed securities shelf offering (4.14 -0.03)16:32ASR Grupo Aeroportuario Del Sureste reports that total passenger traffic for September increased 5.5% yr/yr (155.80 +2.21)Passenger traffic increased 2.0% in Mexico, 8.4% in Puerto Rico, and 12.1% in Colombia.16:23VRCA Verrica Pharmaceuticals CFO Chris Degnan to resign effective on October 18 (14.48 -0.31)Mr. Degnan's resignation did not result from a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices, including its controls or financial related matters.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

Sure, the Chinese are willing to do a deal on mutually agreeable parts, just as they have been all along, and, well, here the market is wondering what the two sides will actually agree upon other than more agricultural purchases and a pushback perhaps of other tariff deadlines.Moreover, it's hard to believe the harder aspects of a trade deal will be easier to work out next year when the election is even closer.Alas, the market reacted to this headline because that's what it does, but it isn't worth chasing at this point because the market doesn't really know what it's chasing.The Russell 2000 is up 0.6%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; and the Dow and S&P 500 are both up 0.2%.13:34COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $8.70 (0.57%) at $1504.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.10 lower (0.57%) at $17.54/oz Dec copper settled $0.01 higher (0.39%) at $2.57/lb13:17MIK Michaels Stores jumps 4% after announcing the complete rollout of UPS (UPS) Access Point locations to more than 1,100 Michaels Companies stores nationwide (9.50 +0.38)As the first of the recently announced retail partners to offer UPS Access Point locations, customers are now able to ship UPS packages directly to a Michaels store, as well as drop off pre-labeled shipments and make returns to e-commerce retailers that offer UPS drop off, all while picking up their favorite seasonal and DIY essentials.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:ETRN Jan20 17.5 calls (volume: 5490, open int: 0, implied vol: ~54%, prev day implied vol: 43%).

Today's price action has largely reflected a lack of conviction as trade speculation ramps up in front of key trade talks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) are little changed, too.Deputy-level trade talks are expected to continue today and tomorrow, with higher-level talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday. NEC Director Larry Kudlow said earlier today that China's "mood" seems to be a little better this week, somewhat muddling a Bloomberg story that suggested China is currently less interested in a complete deal that resolves key structural issues.Some have pointed to Mr. Kudlow's comments as a reason for the market's bounce from its lows this morning, yet there appears to be mixed signals from the trade-sensitive S&P 500 materials (+0.4%), industrials (-0.1%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors. The utilities sector (-0.4%) is today's laggard.Instead, today's price action appears to be driven in part by technical factors. At its low, the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average (2941) before buyers quickly stepped in on no specific news to lift it back above the key technical level and jump-start a move to session highs.Apple (AAPL 229.06, +2.05, +0.9%) remains in focus as it continues its ascent back toward all-time highs on no "new" news today. On a related note, Silicon Motion (SIMO 37.69, +1.84, +5.1%) raised its guidance following a report from last week that indicated Apple asked its suppliers to increase production for its iPhone 11.In other matters, labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.92, +0.10, unch) and the UAW took a "turn for the worse" over the weekend, but shares of GM have erased early losses. Mr. Kudlow commented on the situation, saying the strike is not helping the economy.U.S. Treasuries are pulling back from last week's advance, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up six basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.89. WTI crude is trading 1.8% higher at $53.74/bbl after a steep decline last week.12:49SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (8.27 mln -3.3%)Materials: CLF (9.07 mln +1.36%), FCX (8.85 mln +1.36%)Industrials: GE (16.29 mln -0.06%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (17.15 mln -6.79%), ROKU (13.48 mln -1.53%), F (10.45 mln -0.11%), M (9.05 mln +1.2%)Information Technology: AMD (20.69 mln +0.65%), AAPL (14.76 mln +0.84%), AVYA (9.56 mln +7.27%)Financials: BAC (16.01 mln +0.07%), ITUB (12.73 mln -2.73%), TQQQ (10.35 mln +0.26%)Energy: CHK (24 mln -0.74%), SWN (9.82 mln +0%), RIG (9.24 mln +1.65%), ECA (8.79 mln +0.79%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: AKCA (6.81x +29.25%), TAK (6.03x -0.12%), XENT (3.41x -11.26%), BLUE (2.36x -0.85%), DBVT (1.81x -4.6%)Consumer Discretionary: LIND (2.56x +1.38%)Information Technology: RNG (3.76x +6.58%), AVYA (3.49x +7.27%), SIMO (2.76x +4.9%), SPWR (2.15x -3.05%), PSDO (1.95x +0.15%), FSLR (1.86x -3.35%)Financials: PPR (2.08x +0%), NEWT (1.88x -1.82%)Energy: EURN (2.77x +4.47%), TGP (2.62x +1%), BPT (1.78x -7.59%)Consumer Staples: SMPL (5.52x -3.19%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: AKCA (19.56 +29.25%), GTS (14.85 +7.65%), CYH (4.1 +7.05%)Industrials: MAXR (8.07 +6.68%)Consumer Discretionary: ASNA (0.36 +13.54%), JCP (1.02 +10.7%), OSTK (11.14 +9%), SIG (17.63 +8.49%)Information Technology: AVYA (14.19 +7.27%), RNG (174.04 +6.58%)Energy: TK (4.04 +9.19%), HPR (1.35 +7.14%), ESV (4.56 +7.04%), MDR (1.74 +6.75%), TUSK (2.27 +6.57%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.25 +10.62%), RAD (8.18 +7.77%)Utilities: PCG (11.6 +6.67%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: XENT (15.06 -11.26%), RDUS (23.63 -8.23%), ADAP (1.12 -8.2%), ALLK (72.41 -6.39%), RCUS (8.24 -6.26%), SRPT (82.74 -6.24%), DBVT (8.5 -4.6%), EPZM (10.41 -4.32%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.09 -7.26%), NIO (1.51 -6.79%), PDD (31.16 -6.57%), GPRO (3.8 -4.41%)Information Technology: XELA (1.31 -5.07%)Financials: JEF (17.32 -5.87%), QD (6.49 -5.47%)Energy: BPT (8.16 -7.59%), HCLP (1.44 -5.59%), AR (2.75 -5.17%)Consumer Staples: FIZZ (46.43 -4.89%)12:46AAPL Apple (+1%) hits 52-week high, within 2% of last October's record high (229.34 +2.33)Apple hit a 52-week high today after breaking out on Friday following a report from the Nikkei Asian Review that the iPhone maker asked suppliers to boost production based on solid demand for the new lower end iPhone 11.

The ASCEND balloon did show statistically significant differences in several important secondary endpoints directly attributable to the drug, mometasone furoate, including reduction in inflammation and polypoid edema at all timepoints through day 30.

The price target hike is predicated on expectations for a continued rebound in consumer demand for video cards and a jump in sales of products to data center customers, who are expected to upgrade their systems in late 2019/early 2020.Shares of NVIDIA are up 40.0% since the end of 2018, but that strong gain masks significant volatility that the stock has had to endure in 2019. The company will face easier yr/yr comparisons starting with its Q3 report expected in mid-November, but a new challenge has emerged in the form of stiffer competition from AMD (AMD 29.40, +0.39, +1.4%), which can impact NVIDIA's pricing power.11:57NAT Tanker/Shipping stocks outperforming as industry rates continue to advance (3.08 +0.29)TNK +10.83%, NAT +10.57%, TNP +8.12%, TK +7.70%, DSSI +6.89%, ASC +5.78%, GLOG +5.74%, FRO +5.35%, DHT +4.65%, EURN +4.32%, SB +3.63%, GLOP +2.76%, GNK +2.44%, CPLP +2.21%, etc...This morning, Nordic American commented on the 'exceptionally strong tanker market':"[T]he international shipbroking firm of Clarkson Platou Research reported the largest week-on-week increase in the history of their freight index.

Presently the Suezmax spot market is reported to about $68,000/day, and rising. The NAT operating costs are about $8,000/day per ship. A seasonal upturn was already in the making.

The latter is probably responsible for a portion of the former, yet other factors are also in play:A wait-and-see stance in front of the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China this week in Washington.Ongoing evidence of foreign economic struggles, which manifested themselves in a 0.6% m/m decline in German factory orders in August and a drop in the eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence Index for September to -16.8 from -11.1 in August.Reports that contract negotiations between General Motors (GM 34.71, -0.20, -0.6%) and the UAW have taken "a turn for the worse," which is raising residual concerns about manufacturing sector conditions and U.S. growth prospects.NEC Director Kudlow said a short time ago in a Fox News interview that the GM strike is not helping the economy; however, he also said China's mood seems to be a little better this week and that something positive happening this week is possible, although he doesn't want to make any predictions.The stock market was rebounding from opening losses when Mr. Kudlow made his remarks and continued that rebound effort after the remarks were made, even though his China trade talk angle has been heard before.In any event, the major indices are mixed amid a lack of conviction on the part of buyers and sellers who are likely cognizant that it will be a seesaw this week with respect to speculative trade talk outcomes.The Russell 2000 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%.10:21RNG RingCentral (+6%) extending Friday's breakout to new highs after becoming the exclusive provider of UCaaS solutions to Avaya (AVYA) (173.21 +9.91)The deal made RNG the exclusive provider of Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solutions to Avaya.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/AOther news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019 metrics; net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 mln, from $243.7 mln in the prior year September period (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 mln, or 2.1%, vs the same prior year one-month September period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired.

Data also showed that meaningful long-term reductions in TD were achieved regardless of whether patients responded after two weeks.Neurocrine Biosciences also presented a post-hoc analysis of KINECT 3, the pivotal Phase III study, indicating that both the 40 mg and 80 mg doses of INGREZZA improved TD as early as two weeks in adults with TD, as measured by global clinician and patient scales.17:03ADMA ADMA Biologics files for $200 mln mixed securities shelf offering (4.14 -0.03)16:32ASR Grupo Aeroportuario Del Sureste reports that total passenger traffic for September increased 5.5% yr/yr (155.80 +2.21)Passenger traffic increased 2.0% in Mexico, 8.4% in Puerto Rico, and 12.1% in Colombia.16:23VRCA Verrica Pharmaceuticals CFO Chris Degnan to resign effective on October 18 (14.48 -0.31)Mr. Degnan's resignation did not result from a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices, including its controls or financial related matters.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

Sure, the Chinese are willing to do a deal on mutually agreeable parts, just as they have been all along, and, well, here the market is wondering what the two sides will actually agree upon other than more agricultural purchases and a pushback perhaps of other tariff deadlines.Moreover, it's hard to believe the harder aspects of a trade deal will be easier to work out next year when the election is even closer.Alas, the market reacted to this headline because that's what it does, but it isn't worth chasing at this point because the market doesn't really know what it's chasing.The Russell 2000 is up 0.6%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; and the Dow and S&P 500 are both up 0.2%.13:34COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $8.70 (0.57%) at $1504.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.10 lower (0.57%) at $17.54/oz Dec copper settled $0.01 higher (0.39%) at $2.57/lb13:17MIK Michaels Stores jumps 4% after announcing the complete rollout of UPS (UPS) Access Point locations to more than 1,100 Michaels Companies stores nationwide (9.50 +0.38)As the first of the recently announced retail partners to offer UPS Access Point locations, customers are now able to ship UPS packages directly to a Michaels store, as well as drop off pre-labeled shipments and make returns to e-commerce retailers that offer UPS drop off, all while picking up their favorite seasonal and DIY essentials.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:ETRN Jan20 17.5 calls (volume: 5490, open int: 0, implied vol: ~54%, prev day implied vol: 43%).

Today's price action has largely reflected a lack of conviction as trade speculation ramps up in front of key trade talks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) are little changed, too.Deputy-level trade talks are expected to continue today and tomorrow, with higher-level talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday. NEC Director Larry Kudlow said earlier today that China's "mood" seems to be a little better this week, somewhat muddling a Bloomberg story that suggested China is currently less interested in a complete deal that resolves key structural issues.Some have pointed to Mr. Kudlow's comments as a reason for the market's bounce from its lows this morning, yet there appears to be mixed signals from the trade-sensitive S&P 500 materials (+0.4%), industrials (-0.1%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors. The utilities sector (-0.4%) is today's laggard.Instead, today's price action appears to be driven in part by technical factors. At its low, the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average (2941) before buyers quickly stepped in on no specific news to lift it back above the key technical level and jump-start a move to session highs.Apple (AAPL 229.06, +2.05, +0.9%) remains in focus as it continues its ascent back toward all-time highs on no "new" news today. On a related note, Silicon Motion (SIMO 37.69, +1.84, +5.1%) raised its guidance following a report from last week that indicated Apple asked its suppliers to increase production for its iPhone 11.In other matters, labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.92, +0.10, unch) and the UAW took a "turn for the worse" over the weekend, but shares of GM have erased early losses. Mr. Kudlow commented on the situation, saying the strike is not helping the economy.U.S. Treasuries are pulling back from last week's advance, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up six basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.89. WTI crude is trading 1.8% higher at $53.74/bbl after a steep decline last week.12:49SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (8.27 mln -3.3%)Materials: CLF (9.07 mln +1.36%), FCX (8.85 mln +1.36%)Industrials: GE (16.29 mln -0.06%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (17.15 mln -6.79%), ROKU (13.48 mln -1.53%), F (10.45 mln -0.11%), M (9.05 mln +1.2%)Information Technology: AMD (20.69 mln +0.65%), AAPL (14.76 mln +0.84%), AVYA (9.56 mln +7.27%)Financials: BAC (16.01 mln +0.07%), ITUB (12.73 mln -2.73%), TQQQ (10.35 mln +0.26%)Energy: CHK (24 mln -0.74%), SWN (9.82 mln +0%), RIG (9.24 mln +1.65%), ECA (8.79 mln +0.79%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: AKCA (6.81x +29.25%), TAK (6.03x -0.12%), XENT (3.41x -11.26%), BLUE (2.36x -0.85%), DBVT (1.81x -4.6%)Consumer Discretionary: LIND (2.56x +1.38%)Information Technology: RNG (3.76x +6.58%), AVYA (3.49x +7.27%), SIMO (2.76x +4.9%), SPWR (2.15x -3.05%), PSDO (1.95x +0.15%), FSLR (1.86x -3.35%)Financials: PPR (2.08x +0%), NEWT (1.88x -1.82%)Energy: EURN (2.77x +4.47%), TGP (2.62x +1%), BPT (1.78x -7.59%)Consumer Staples: SMPL (5.52x -3.19%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: AKCA (19.56 +29.25%), GTS (14.85 +7.65%), CYH (4.1 +7.05%)Industrials: MAXR (8.07 +6.68%)Consumer Discretionary: ASNA (0.36 +13.54%), JCP (1.02 +10.7%), OSTK (11.14 +9%), SIG (17.63 +8.49%)Information Technology: AVYA (14.19 +7.27%), RNG (174.04 +6.58%)Energy: TK (4.04 +9.19%), HPR (1.35 +7.14%), ESV (4.56 +7.04%), MDR (1.74 +6.75%), TUSK (2.27 +6.57%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.25 +10.62%), RAD (8.18 +7.77%)Utilities: PCG (11.6 +6.67%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: XENT (15.06 -11.26%), RDUS (23.63 -8.23%), ADAP (1.12 -8.2%), ALLK (72.41 -6.39%), RCUS (8.24 -6.26%), SRPT (82.74 -6.24%), DBVT (8.5 -4.6%), EPZM (10.41 -4.32%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.09 -7.26%), NIO (1.51 -6.79%), PDD (31.16 -6.57%), GPRO (3.8 -4.41%)Information Technology: XELA (1.31 -5.07%)Financials: JEF (17.32 -5.87%), QD (6.49 -5.47%)Energy: BPT (8.16 -7.59%), HCLP (1.44 -5.59%), AR (2.75 -5.17%)Consumer Staples: FIZZ (46.43 -4.89%)12:46AAPL Apple (+1%) hits 52-week high, within 2% of last October's record high (229.34 +2.33)Apple hit a 52-week high today after breaking out on Friday following a report from the Nikkei Asian Review that the iPhone maker asked suppliers to boost production based on solid demand for the new lower end iPhone 11.

The IMX is TD Ameritrade's proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets.The reading for the four-week period ending Sept. 27, 2019 fell by 2 percent, continuing an 11-month trend of below-average IMX scores. Compared to historic averages, this score ranks "Moderately Low". Equity markets were mixed during September, with the S&P 500 moving higher by 1.2 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increasing by 1.6 percent. The Nasdaq Composite ended the period slightly lower, down 0.3 percent, as the technology sector lagged. Oil prices were volatile following an attack on a Saudi oil facility, posting the biggest one-day gain in more than a decade.

The companies are also eligible for milestone payments of up to $1.3 bln and tiered royalties on sales following marketing approval. Upgraded to Outperform at Wells Fargo. LVGO (19.9 +14.9%): Co was awarded a contract to provided the Livongo for Diabetes solution to eligible members covered by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program who are living with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes under one health plan covering 5.3 mln federal employees, retirees, and their families; co anticipates that this agreement will push its membership adds for Livongo for Diabetes Members well above prior guidance, seeing approx. 25,000 adds in 2020, growing to approx. 45,000 in 2021; based on this updated enrollment, co expects the agreement to account for a total of $50-60 mln in revenue over the two-year span. OSTK (11.64 +13.89%): Continued volatility; the stock advances after opening the session at a slight loss.Small Cap LosersXENT (15.25 -10.16%): A study of co's ASCEND investigational drug-coated sinus balloon, in which the ASCEND product was randomized against an uncoated balloon control to evaluate whether it would reduce post-balloon dilation edema through localized steroid delivery directly to the dilated tissue, did not meet its primary endpoint of intra-patient comparison of frontal sinus patency grade at day 30. The ASCEND balloon did show statistically significant differences in several important secondary endpoints directly attributable to the drug, mometasone furoate, including reduction in inflammation and polypoid edema at all timepoints through day 30. Co, while disappointed with the primary endpoint result, "will continue to analyze the ASCEND study findings to inform [co's] clinical and regulatory strategy." At two-year lows.RDUS (23.61 -8.31%): Tracks to its lowest levels since August on above average volume. In recent sector events, Pfenex (PFNX) announced that it has received FDA approval for its NDA for PF708, indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture, with Forteo (teriparatide injection -- an Eli Lilly [LLY] product) as the reference drug. Co is also active in the osteoporosis space; its TYMLOS (abaloparatide) injection product is approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.ZYXI (11.48 -8.2%): The stock pulls back after establishing a new high in early trade, having at this morning's high gained circa +38% through the past week, bolstered by co's Q3 order growth statistics.12:04AXNX Axonics Modulation sells off 8% as Medtronic (MDT -1%) seeks approval for InterStim Micro neurostimulator and InterStim SureScan MRI leads (23.49 -2.04)This morning, Medtronic (MDT) announced it had filed a pre-market approval (PMA) supplement with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of its InterStim Micro neurostimulator and also its InterStim SureScan MRI leads. InterStim Micro is a rechargeable, implantable sacral neuromodulation (SNM) device to treat patients affected by overactive bladder, urinary urge incontinence, unobstructed urinary retention and fecal incontinence. The SureScan leads, which will be used in future implants of the recharge-free InterStim II system and rechargeable InterStim Micro system, are designed to provide full-body 1.5 and 3 Tesla MRI conditional labeling, pending FDA approval.This submission, pending regulatory approval from the FDA, would position the Company to achieve approval for the InterStim Micro system and SureScan MRI leads in the spring of 2020, following a standard 180-day review process.Axonics is commercializing implantable SNM devices for patients with urinary and bowel dysfunction. In September, the company received FDA approval for its Axonics r-SNM System, the first rechargeable SNM system approved for sale in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. The FDA approval grants Axonics the right to market its product in the United States for the clinical indication of fecal incontinence. The approval includes the claim of a 15-year functional life and the ability of patients to undergo full-body MRI scans without the necessity of having the device explanted.11:58NVDA NVIDIA eyes September high (186.74 +4.77)NVIDIA (NVDA 186.74, +4.77, +2.6%) has gotten off to a strong start in a subdued market, making a run at a five-month high (188.40) that was notched in mid-September.Today's advance has received assistance from RBC Capital Markets after the firm increased its price target for the stock to $217 from $190. The price target hike is predicated on expectations for a continued rebound in consumer demand for video cards and a jump in sales of products to data center customers, who are expected to upgrade their systems in late 2019/early 2020.Shares of NVIDIA are up 40.0% since the end of 2018, but that strong gain masks significant volatility that the stock has had to endure in 2019. The company will face easier yr/yr comparisons starting with its Q3 report expected in mid-November, but a new challenge has emerged in the form of stiffer competition from AMD (AMD 29.40, +0.39, +1.4%), which can impact NVIDIA's pricing power.11:57NAT Tanker/Shipping stocks outperforming as industry rates continue to advance (3.08 +0.29)TNK +10.83%, NAT +10.57%, TNP +8.12%, TK +7.70%, DSSI +6.89%, ASC +5.78%, GLOG +5.74%, FRO +5.35%, DHT +4.65%, EURN +4.32%, SB +3.63%, GLOP +2.76%, GNK +2.44%, CPLP +2.21%, etc...This morning, Nordic American commented on the 'exceptionally strong tanker market':"[T]he international shipbroking firm of Clarkson Platou Research reported the largest week-on-week increase in the history of their freight index.

NAT's uniform fleet of 23 Suezmax tankers have 21 units trading in the open spot market, ready to benefit from strengthening freights. Presently the Suezmax spot market is reported to about $68,000/day, and rising. The NAT operating costs are about $8,000/day per ship. A seasonal upturn was already in the making. However, the additional combination of increased demand from refineries around the world ramping up their production to supply low sulphur fuels for 2020 and reduced supply of new vessels are important structural factors."Reuters coverage of shipping rates.

The latter is probably responsible for a portion of the former, yet other factors are also in play:A wait-and-see stance in front of the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China this week in Washington.Ongoing evidence of foreign economic struggles, which manifested themselves in a 0.6% m/m decline in German factory orders in August and a drop in the eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence Index for September to -16.8 from -11.1 in August.Reports that contract negotiations between General Motors (GM 34.71, -0.20, -0.6%) and the UAW have taken "a turn for the worse," which is raising residual concerns about manufacturing sector conditions and U.S. growth prospects.NEC Director Kudlow said a short time ago in a Fox News interview that the GM strike is not helping the economy; however, he also said China's mood seems to be a little better this week and that something positive happening this week is possible, although he doesn't want to make any predictions.The stock market was rebounding from opening losses when Mr. Kudlow made his remarks and continued that rebound effort after the remarks were made, even though his China trade talk angle has been heard before.In any event, the major indices are mixed amid a lack of conviction on the part of buyers and sellers who are likely cognizant that it will be a seesaw this week with respect to speculative trade talk outcomes.The Russell 2000 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%.10:21RNG RingCentral (+6%) extending Friday's breakout to new highs after becoming the exclusive provider of UCaaS solutions to Avaya (AVYA) (173.21 +9.91)The deal made RNG the exclusive provider of Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solutions to Avaya. RingCentral and Avaya will jointly develop programs to leverage Avaya's global sales and partner network, as well as build automated technologies for seamless customer transition to RingCentral's leading global UCaaS solution. Avaya has one of the world's largest installed base of on-premise Unified Communications (UC) seats, and an extensive partner network, spanning over 180 countries.RingCentral will pay Avaya an advance of $375 mln, predominantly for future commissions, as well as certain licensing rights. The Consideration Advance will be paid primarily in stock.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/AOther news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019 metrics; net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 mln, from $243.7 mln in the prior year September period (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 mln, or 2.1%, vs the same prior year one-month September period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

To further support an "A" rating, Pfenex is conducting a comparative human factors study between PF708 and Forteo as requested by FDA. Pfenex anticipates submitting the final study report to the FDA as early as the second half of October 2019 and believes that this completes the information package required by the FDA to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of PF708.06:09BOLD Audentes Therapeutics presents new positive data from ASPIRO; Continued significant and durable improvements in respiratory function (27.84 )Audentes Therapeutics announced new positive data from ASPIRO, the clinical trial evaluating AT132 in patients with X-Linked Myotubular MyopathyEfficacy - Patients receiving AT132 have achieved significant and durable reductions in ventilator dependence, an endpoint considered to be closely correlated with morbidity and mortality in XLMTM patients. To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired. S&P Futures are off by fifteen points, trading around the 2936 level. This comes after spoos put in a high of 2943.25 and a low of 2928.00.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong were closed. Chinese markets will re-open tomorrow after a week-long hiatus. In Japan, the Nikkei gave back about 0.2%, which is encouraging considering key heavyweights such as Honda and Panasonic closed about 1% lower. In Europe, the major bourses are down but having an uneventful session. Germany posted a weaker than expected Factory Orders figure for August that came in at -0.6%, after the market expected a fall of only 0.3%. This, and the early pressure in the US, has seemingly kept a lid on equity gains throughout the region.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -16.010 yr Note: 1.52%USD/JPY: 106.84 -0.06EUR/USD: 1.0971 -0.0005Europe: FTSE -0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng CLOSED Shanghai CLOSED Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1508.10 -4.80) Silver (17.50 -0.12) Crude (52.99 +0.18)18:02WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ENDP (3.82 +19.75%), ARQL (8.29 +18.43%), SRPT (88.25 +17.67%), CDNA (25.37 +16.22%), RGNX (38.49 +15.41%), ARWR (30.6 +13.5%)Materials: SBGL (6.36 +14.39%)Consumer Discretionary: TSG (20.92 +38.82%)Information Technology: RNG (163.3 +31.85%), AVYA (13.23 +28.45%), OKTA (116.53 +20.06%), COUP (148.32 +15.97%)Energy: TOO (1.53 +30.77%), DHT (6.88 +14.1%), STNG (33.65 +14.07%), FRO (10.28 +12.72%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: GTHX (23.34 -31.29%), LNTH (19.74 -22.04%), ANGO (14.6 -19.02%)Materials: SXC (5.31 -15.71%)Consumer Discretionary: GPRO (3.97 -21%), TAST (6.8 -16.46%)Information Technology: CASA (6.22 -20.47%)Financials: AMTD (33.7 -28.25%), ETFC (36.4 -15.87%)Energy: NBR (1.57 -18.65%), MDR (1.63 -18.5%), QEP (3.15 -17.54%), CDEV (3.8 -15.95%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (7.45 -34.76%), CALM (37.97 -16.4%)18:01NBIX Neurocrine Biosci presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia (89.73 -0.20)The analyses of pooled data from multiple long-term studies of the 40 mg dose showed that 53.7% of patients taking 40 mg of INGREZZA achieved an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) response (= 50% improvement from baseline) after 48 weeks of treatment. INGREZZA is available in two doses, 40 mg and 80 mg. Additionally, an analysis of the pivotal Phase III KINECT 3 data demonstrated that 50% of patients achieved an early response after two weeks of INGREZZA treatment (40 mg or 80 mg). Data also showed that meaningful long-term reductions in TD were achieved regardless of whether patients responded after two weeks.Neurocrine Biosciences also presented a post-hoc analysis of KINECT 3, the pivotal Phase III study, indicating that both the 40 mg and 80 mg doses of INGREZZA improved TD as early as two weeks in adults with TD, as measured by global clinician and patient scales.17:03ADMA ADMA Biologics files for $200 mln mixed securities shelf offering (4.14 -0.03)16:32ASR Grupo Aeroportuario Del Sureste reports that total passenger traffic for September increased 5.5% yr/yr (155.80 +2.21)Passenger traffic increased 2.0% in Mexico, 8.4% in Puerto Rico, and 12.1% in Colombia.16:23VRCA Verrica Pharmaceuticals CFO Chris Degnan to resign effective on October 18 (14.48 -0.31)Mr. Degnan's resignation did not result from a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices, including its controls or financial related matters.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

DDOG (36.55 +5.27%): Sees continued volatility, now having advanced higher by circa +18% during the most recent three sessions; software stocks generally trend higher. (Related: FSLY, CRWD, MDB...)

Prior to this action, the stock had mostly held up steadily near or above $80 since more than doubling in early August following results from a Phase 2 trial for AK002.SDC (13.93 -5.36%): The September IPO sees volatility following the arrival of a host of analyst initiations; the coverage was broadly positive, with the stock receiving a Buy rating from at least seven firms (UBS, Guggenheim, BofA/Merrill, Stifel, Citigroup, Jefferies, Loop Capital), joined by Outperform ratings from Credit Suisse and William Blair and an Overweight from JPMorgan; price targets from those firms range from Credit Suisse's $18 target to JPMorgan's $31 view.14:18TALKX Market Briefing: Unwinding the headline chaseWell, in a perfect example of why it's silly to chase a trade deal speculation headline at this point (the senior officials don't meet until Thursday and Friday), there was some added context provided by a FOX Business reporter to the headline that drove a spike in the indices a short time ago.What has been added reportedly is a declaration from China's Commerce Ministry that changes to their laws on intellectual property are not on the negotiating table and never will be. Any such changes, it was said, will be managed through administrative regulations.The market is in the midst of unwinding the previous spike.This is unlikely to be the last time this week that the market is taken for a ride on an ostensible trade negotiation headline catalyst. Be on guard then for "misdirection" because of it. It's not until the principles start talking late in the week that there will be any true sense of what is coming out of these negotiations.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 are basically flat.13:43TALKX Market Briefing: Chasing after a hopeful trade headlineThe stock market saw a quick spike up on a headline from a FOX Business reporter, who said the Chinese Commerce Ministry is ready to do a deal on the parts of the negotiations both sides agree on and are prepared to lay out a timetable for the harder issues to be worked out next year.It was a Pavlovian reaction for the stock market and the algorithms that move it, but this news lacks any true meaning because it is a natural expression of what could be taken for granted ahead of any such reporting. Sure, the Chinese are willing to do a deal on mutually agreeable parts, just as they have been all along, and, well, here the market is wondering what the two sides will actually agree upon other than more agricultural purchases and a pushback perhaps of other tariff deadlines.Moreover, it's hard to believe the harder aspects of a trade deal will be easier to work out next year when the election is even closer.Alas, the market reacted to this headline because that's what it does, but it isn't worth chasing at this point because the market doesn't really know what it's chasing.The Russell 2000 is up 0.6%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; and the Dow and S&P 500 are both up 0.2%.13:34COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $8.70 (0.57%) at $1504.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.10 lower (0.57%) at $17.54/oz Dec copper settled $0.01 higher (0.39%) at $2.57/lb13:17MIK Michaels Stores jumps 4% after announcing the complete rollout of UPS (UPS) Access Point locations to more than 1,100 Michaels Companies stores nationwide (9.50 +0.38)As the first of the recently announced retail partners to offer UPS Access Point locations, customers are now able to ship UPS packages directly to a Michaels store, as well as drop off pre-labeled shipments and make returns to e-commerce retailers that offer UPS drop off, all while picking up their favorite seasonal and DIY essentials.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:ETRN Jan20 17.5 calls (volume: 5490, open int: 0, implied vol: ~54%, prev day implied vol: 43%).

Today's price action has largely reflected a lack of conviction as trade speculation ramps up in front of key trade talks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) are little changed, too.Deputy-level trade talks are expected to continue today and tomorrow, with higher-level talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday. NEC Director Larry Kudlow said earlier today that China's "mood" seems to be a little better this week, somewhat muddling a Bloomberg story that suggested China is currently less interested in a complete deal that resolves key structural issues.Some have pointed to Mr. Kudlow's comments as a reason for the market's bounce from its lows this morning, yet there appears to be mixed signals from the trade-sensitive S&P 500 materials (+0.4%), industrials (-0.1%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors. The utilities sector (-0.4%) is today's laggard.Instead, today's price action appears to be driven in part by technical factors. At its low, the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average (2941) before buyers quickly stepped in on no specific news to lift it back above the key technical level and jump-start a move to session highs.Apple (AAPL 229.06, +2.05, +0.9%) remains in focus as it continues its ascent back toward all-time highs on no "new" news today. On a related note, Silicon Motion (SIMO 37.69, +1.84, +5.1%) raised its guidance following a report from last week that indicated Apple asked its suppliers to increase production for its iPhone 11.In other matters, labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.92, +0.10, unch) and the UAW took a "turn for the worse" over the weekend, but shares of GM have erased early losses.

A survival analysis using a time-dependent Cox regression model showed that the difference in probability of survival between treated patients and untreated natural history control patients was highly statistically significant (p<0.0006). In addition to the survival benefit, the vast majority of treated patients (94.7%) had either improved (68%) or stabilized (26%) responses in major functional domains. Among clinical responders, a subset demonstrated profound responses, in some cases re-acquiring previously lost motor milestones.Safety & TolerabilitySafety data from RETRO indicated that SET is generally safe and well-tolerated. Most reported adverse events were considered not related to study drug (199 of 292), with mild or moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event, occurring in 63% of patients.Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 14 subjects (37%). The majority of SAEs were deemed related to TK2d; two patients experienced three events related to study drug alone (kidney stone, kidney stone removal, diarrhea).Two adult-onset patients stopped treatment due to asymptomatic increases in aminotransferase liver enzymes (no increase in bilirubin levels), which resolved upon discontinuation of treatment.08:07WIRES On The WiresAllergan plc (AGN) announced the launch of three new over-the-counter REFRESH RELIEVA products: REFRESH RELIEVA, REFRESH RELIEVA PF (preservative-free) multidose, and REFRESH RELIEVA FOR CONTACTS.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/AOther news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019 metrics; net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 mln, from $243.7 mln in the prior year September period (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 mln, or 2.1%, vs the same prior year one-month September period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors.

HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa. During this phase of rapid expansion, the Chief Financial Officer should be working very closely with all team members, in person.

DDOG (36.55 +5.27%): Sees continued volatility, now having advanced higher by circa +18% during the most recent three sessions; software stocks generally trend higher. (Related: FSLY, CRWD, MDB...) NTRA (37.22 +4.93%): Advances to a new all-time high, now up by circa +13% over the past week.

Prior to this action, the stock had mostly held up steadily near or above $80 since more than doubling in early August following results from a Phase 2 trial for AK002.SDC (13.93 -5.36%): The September IPO sees volatility following the arrival of a host of analyst initiations; the coverage was broadly positive, with the stock receiving a Buy rating from at least seven firms (UBS, Guggenheim, BofA/Merrill, Stifel, Citigroup, Jefferies, Loop Capital), joined by Outperform ratings from Credit Suisse and William Blair and an Overweight from JPMorgan; price targets from those firms range from Credit Suisse's $18 target to JPMorgan's $31 view.14:18TALKX Market Briefing: Unwinding the headline chaseWell, in a perfect example of why it's silly to chase a trade deal speculation headline at this point (the senior officials don't meet until Thursday and Friday), there was some added context provided by a FOX Business reporter to the headline that drove a spike in the indices a short time ago.What has been added reportedly is a declaration from China's Commerce Ministry that changes to their laws on intellectual property are not on the negotiating table and never will be. Any such changes, it was said, will be managed through administrative regulations.The market is in the midst of unwinding the previous spike.This is unlikely to be the last time this week that the market is taken for a ride on an ostensible trade negotiation headline catalyst. Be on guard then for "misdirection" because of it. It's not until the principles start talking late in the week that there will be any true sense of what is coming out of these negotiations.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 are basically flat.13:43TALKX Market Briefing: Chasing after a hopeful trade headlineThe stock market saw a quick spike up on a headline from a FOX Business reporter, who said the Chinese Commerce Ministry is ready to do a deal on the parts of the negotiations both sides agree on and are prepared to lay out a timetable for the harder issues to be worked out next year.It was a Pavlovian reaction for the stock market and the algorithms that move it, but this news lacks any true meaning because it is a natural expression of what could be taken for granted ahead of any such reporting. Sure, the Chinese are willing to do a deal on mutually agreeable parts, just as they have been all along, and, well, here the market is wondering what the two sides will actually agree upon other than more agricultural purchases and a pushback perhaps of other tariff deadlines.Moreover, it's hard to believe the harder aspects of a trade deal will be easier to work out next year when the election is even closer.Alas, the market reacted to this headline because that's what it does, but it isn't worth chasing at this point because the market doesn't really know what it's chasing.The Russell 2000 is up 0.6%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; and the Dow and S&P 500 are both up 0.2%.13:34COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $8.70 (0.57%) at $1504.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.10 lower (0.57%) at $17.54/oz Dec copper settled $0.01 higher (0.39%) at $2.57/lb13:17MIK Michaels Stores jumps 4% after announcing the complete rollout of UPS (UPS) Access Point locations to more than 1,100 Michaels Companies stores nationwide (9.50 +0.38)As the first of the recently announced retail partners to offer UPS Access Point locations, customers are now able to ship UPS packages directly to a Michaels store, as well as drop off pre-labeled shipments and make returns to e-commerce retailers that offer UPS drop off, all while picking up their favorite seasonal and DIY essentials.13:16OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:ETRN Jan20 17.5 calls (volume: 5490, open int: 0, implied vol: ~54%, prev day implied vol: 43%).

Today's price action has largely reflected a lack of conviction as trade speculation ramps up in front of key trade talks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) are little changed, too.Deputy-level trade talks are expected to continue today and tomorrow, with higher-level talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday. NEC Director Larry Kudlow said earlier today that China's "mood" seems to be a little better this week, somewhat muddling a Bloomberg story that suggested China is currently less interested in a complete deal that resolves key structural issues.Some have pointed to Mr. Kudlow's comments as a reason for the market's bounce from its lows this morning, yet there appears to be mixed signals from the trade-sensitive S&P 500 materials (+0.4%), industrials (-0.1%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors. The utilities sector (-0.4%) is today's laggard.Instead, today's price action appears to be driven in part by technical factors. At its low, the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average (2941) before buyers quickly stepped in on no specific news to lift it back above the key technical level and jump-start a move to session highs.Apple (AAPL 229.06, +2.05, +0.9%) remains in focus as it continues its ascent back toward all-time highs on no "new" news today. On a related note, Silicon Motion (SIMO 37.69, +1.84, +5.1%) raised its guidance following a report from last week that indicated Apple asked its suppliers to increase production for its iPhone 11.In other matters, labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.92, +0.10, unch) and the UAW took a "turn for the worse" over the weekend, but shares of GM have erased early losses. Mr. Kudlow commented on the situation, saying the strike is not helping the economy.U.S. Treasuries are pulling back from last week's advance, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield is up six basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.89. WTI crude is trading 1.8% higher at $53.74/bbl after a steep decline last week.12:49SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (8.27 mln -3.3%)Materials: CLF (9.07 mln +1.36%), FCX (8.85 mln +1.36%)Industrials: GE (16.29 mln -0.06%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (17.15 mln -6.79%), ROKU (13.48 mln -1.53%), F (10.45 mln -0.11%), M (9.05 mln +1.2%)Information Technology: AMD (20.69 mln +0.65%), AAPL (14.76 mln +0.84%), AVYA (9.56 mln +7.27%)Financials: BAC (16.01 mln +0.07%), ITUB (12.73 mln -2.73%), TQQQ (10.35 mln +0.26%)Energy: CHK (24 mln -0.74%), SWN (9.82 mln +0%), RIG (9.24 mln +1.65%), ECA (8.79 mln +0.79%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: AKCA (6.81x +29.25%), TAK (6.03x -0.12%), XENT (3.41x -11.26%), BLUE (2.36x -0.85%), DBVT (1.81x -4.6%)Consumer Discretionary: LIND (2.56x +1.38%)Information Technology: RNG (3.76x +6.58%), AVYA (3.49x +7.27%), SIMO (2.76x +4.9%), SPWR (2.15x -3.05%), PSDO (1.95x +0.15%), FSLR (1.86x -3.35%)Financials: PPR (2.08x +0%), NEWT (1.88x -1.82%)Energy: EURN (2.77x +4.47%), TGP (2.62x +1%), BPT (1.78x -7.59%)Consumer Staples: SMPL (5.52x -3.19%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: AKCA (19.56 +29.25%), GTS (14.85 +7.65%), CYH (4.1 +7.05%)Industrials: MAXR (8.07 +6.68%)Consumer Discretionary: ASNA (0.36 +13.54%), JCP (1.02 +10.7%), OSTK (11.14 +9%), SIG (17.63 +8.49%)Information Technology: AVYA (14.19 +7.27%), RNG (174.04 +6.58%)Energy: TK (4.04 +9.19%), HPR (1.35 +7.14%), ESV (4.56 +7.04%), MDR (1.74 +6.75%), TUSK (2.27 +6.57%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.25 +10.62%), RAD (8.18 +7.77%)Utilities: PCG (11.6 +6.67%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: XENT (15.06 -11.26%), RDUS (23.63 -8.23%), ADAP (1.12 -8.2%), ALLK (72.41 -6.39%), RCUS (8.24 -6.26%), SRPT (82.74 -6.24%), DBVT (8.5 -4.6%), EPZM (10.41 -4.32%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (1.09 -7.26%), NIO (1.51 -6.79%), PDD (31.16 -6.57%), GPRO (3.8 -4.41%)Information Technology: XELA (1.31 -5.07%)Financials: JEF (17.32 -5.87%), QD (6.49 -5.47%)Energy: BPT (8.16 -7.59%), HCLP (1.44 -5.59%), AR (2.75 -5.17%)Consumer Staples: FIZZ (46.43 -4.89%)12:46AAPL Apple (+1%) hits 52-week high, within 2% of last October's record high (229.34 +2.33)Apple hit a 52-week high today after breaking out on Friday following a report from the Nikkei Asian Review that the iPhone maker asked suppliers to boost production based on solid demand for the new lower end iPhone 11.

The IMX is TD Ameritrade's proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets.The reading for the four-week period ending Sept. 27, 2019 fell by 2 percent, continuing an 11-month trend of below-average IMX scores. Compared to historic averages, this score ranks "Moderately Low". Equity markets were mixed during September, with the S&P 500 moving higher by 1.2 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increasing by 1.6 percent. The Nasdaq Composite ended the period slightly lower, down 0.3 percent, as the technology sector lagged.

OSTK (11.64 +13.89%): Continued volatility; the stock advances after opening the session at a slight loss.Small Cap LosersXENT (15.25 -10.16%): A study of co's ASCEND investigational drug-coated sinus balloon, in which the ASCEND product was randomized against an uncoated balloon control to evaluate whether it would reduce post-balloon dilation edema through localized steroid delivery directly to the dilated tissue, did not meet its primary endpoint of intra-patient comparison of frontal sinus patency grade at day 30. The ASCEND balloon did show statistically significant differences in several important secondary endpoints directly attributable to the drug, mometasone furoate, including reduction in inflammation and polypoid edema at all timepoints through day 30. Co, while disappointed with the primary endpoint result, "will continue to analyze the ASCEND study findings to inform [co's] clinical and regulatory strategy."

InterStim Micro is a rechargeable, implantable sacral neuromodulation (SNM) device to treat patients affected by overactive bladder, urinary urge incontinence, unobstructed urinary retention and fecal incontinence. The SureScan leads, which will be used in future implants of the recharge-free InterStim II system and rechargeable InterStim Micro system, are designed to provide full-body 1.5 and 3 Tesla MRI conditional labeling, pending FDA approval.This submission, pending regulatory approval from the FDA, would position the Company to achieve approval for the InterStim Micro system and SureScan MRI leads in the spring of 2020, following a standard 180-day review process.Axonics is commercializing implantable SNM devices for patients with urinary and bowel dysfunction. In September, the company received FDA approval for its Axonics r-SNM System, the first rechargeable SNM system approved for sale in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia.

The price target hike is predicated on expectations for a continued rebound in consumer demand for video cards and a jump in sales of products to data center customers, who are expected to upgrade their systems in late 2019/early 2020.Shares of NVIDIA are up 40.0% since the end of 2018, but that strong gain masks significant volatility that the stock has had to endure in 2019. The company will face easier yr/yr comparisons starting with its Q3 report expected in mid-November, but a new challenge has emerged in the form of stiffer competition from AMD (AMD 29.40, +0.39, +1.4%), which can impact NVIDIA's pricing power.11:57NAT Tanker/Shipping stocks outperforming as industry rates continue to advance (3.08 +0.29)TNK +10.83%, NAT +10.57%, TNP +8.12%, TK +7.70%, DSSI +6.89%, ASC +5.78%, GLOG +5.74%, FRO +5.35%, DHT +4.65%, EURN +4.32%, SB +3.63%, GLOP +2.76%, GNK +2.44%, CPLP +2.21%, etc...This morning, Nordic American commented on the 'exceptionally strong tanker market':"[T]he international shipbroking firm of Clarkson Platou Research reported the largest week-on-week increase in the history of their freight index.

NAT's uniform fleet of 23 Suezmax tankers have 21 units trading in the open spot market, ready to benefit from strengthening freights. Presently the Suezmax spot market is reported to about $68,000/day, and rising. The NAT operating costs are about $8,000/day per ship. A seasonal upturn was already in the making. However, the additional combination of increased demand from refineries around the world ramping up their production to supply low sulphur fuels for 2020 and reduced supply of new vessels are important structural factors."Reuters coverage of shipping rates.

The latter is probably responsible for a portion of the former, yet other factors are also in play:A wait-and-see stance in front of the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China this week in Washington.Ongoing evidence of foreign economic struggles, which manifested themselves in a 0.6% m/m decline in German factory orders in August and a drop in the eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence Index for September to -16.8 from -11.1 in August.Reports that contract negotiations between General Motors (GM 34.71, -0.20, -0.6%) and the UAW have taken "a turn for the worse," which is raising residual concerns about manufacturing sector conditions and U.S. growth prospects.NEC Director Kudlow said a short time ago in a Fox News interview that the GM strike is not helping the economy; however, he also said China's mood seems to be a little better this week and that something positive happening this week is possible, although he doesn't want to make any predictions.The stock market was rebounding from opening losses when Mr. Kudlow made his remarks and continued that rebound effort after the remarks were made, even though his China trade talk angle has been heard before.In any event, the major indices are mixed amid a lack of conviction on the part of buyers and sellers who are likely cognizant that it will be a seesaw this week with respect to speculative trade talk outcomes.The Russell 2000 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%.10:21RNG RingCentral (+6%) extending Friday's breakout to new highs after becoming the exclusive provider of UCaaS solutions to Avaya (AVYA) (173.21 +9.91)The deal made RNG the exclusive provider of Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solutions to Avaya. RingCentral and Avaya will jointly develop programs to leverage Avaya's global sales and partner network, as well as build automated technologies for seamless customer transition to RingCentral's leading global UCaaS solution. Avaya has one of the world's largest installed base of on-premise Unified Communications (UC) seats, and an extensive partner network, spanning over 180 countries.RingCentral will pay Avaya an advance of $375 mln, predominantly for future commissions, as well as certain licensing rights. The Consideration Advance will be paid primarily in stock.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/AOther news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019 metrics; net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 mln, from $243.7 mln in the prior year September period (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 mln, or 2.1%, vs the same prior year one-month September period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired. S&P Futures are off by fifteen points, trading around the 2936 level. This comes after spoos put in a high of 2943.25 and a low of 2928.00.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong were closed. Chinese markets will re-open tomorrow after a week-long hiatus. In Japan, the Nikkei gave back about 0.2%, which is encouraging considering key heavyweights such as Honda and Panasonic closed about 1% lower. In Europe, the major bourses are down but having an uneventful session. Germany posted a weaker than expected Factory Orders figure for August that came in at -0.6%, after the market expected a fall of only 0.3%. This, and the early pressure in the US, has seemingly kept a lid on equity gains throughout the region.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -16.010 yr Note: 1.52%USD/JPY: 106.84 -0.06EUR/USD: 1.0971 -0.0005Europe: FTSE -0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng CLOSED Shanghai CLOSED Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1508.10 -4.80) Silver (17.50 -0.12) Crude (52.99 +0.18)18:02WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ENDP (3.82 +19.75%), ARQL (8.29 +18.43%), SRPT (88.25 +17.67%), CDNA (25.37 +16.22%), RGNX (38.49 +15.41%), ARWR (30.6 +13.5%)Materials: SBGL (6.36 +14.39%)Consumer Discretionary: TSG (20.92 +38.82%)Information Technology: RNG (163.3 +31.85%), AVYA (13.23 +28.45%), OKTA (116.53 +20.06%), COUP (148.32 +15.97%)Energy: TOO (1.53 +30.77%), DHT (6.88 +14.1%), STNG (33.65 +14.07%), FRO (10.28 +12.72%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: GTHX (23.34 -31.29%), LNTH (19.74 -22.04%), ANGO (14.6 -19.02%)Materials: SXC (5.31 -15.71%)Consumer Discretionary: GPRO (3.97 -21%), TAST (6.8 -16.46%)Information Technology: CASA (6.22 -20.47%)Financials: AMTD (33.7 -28.25%), ETFC (36.4 -15.87%)Energy: NBR (1.57 -18.65%), MDR (1.63 -18.5%), QEP (3.15 -17.54%), CDEV (3.8 -15.95%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (7.45 -34.76%), CALM (37.97 -16.4%)18:01NBIX Neurocrine Biosci presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia (89.73 -0.20)The analyses of pooled data from multiple long-term studies of the 40 mg dose showed that 53.7% of patients taking 40 mg of INGREZZA achieved an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) response (= 50% improvement from baseline) after 48 weeks of treatment.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

Hong Kong protests manifest on UC Davis campusThe California Aggie: University of California, DavisOctober 25, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: FEATURES; Pg. 1Length: 2493 wordsBodyDavis4HK organizes protest, gathers signatures for members of CongressFernando Anguiano, a fourth-year community and regional development major, viewed a video on Reddit on Oct. 9 that featured a student from mainland China taking down a poster supporting the Hong Kong protests outside the CoHo. The video sparked increased tensions on the UC Davis campus, despite the fact that the Hong Kong protests began this past June.The protests in Hong Kong concern a bill that would expand the list of countries to which suspected offenders could be sent - notably allowing extradition to mainland China. After the protests in June, the legislation was indefinitely suspended by Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam, but protests continued because the bill was not formally dead. Protestors have five main requests: a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, the release of protestors arrested without charges, the withdrawal of the characterization of all protests as riots, an independent investigation into police brutality and the implementation of full universal suffrage."Seeing that really enraged me," Anguiano said. "It just felt like our own ability to speak out was being silenced on our own campus and it just felt extremely unfair. I never expected [the event] to get this big and gain so much popularity. I originally expected it to just be myself and two other people, but it gathered support in just a week."Anguiano has no ties to Hong Kong or China but wanted to take action. He created an Oct. 16 Facebook event and started a Discord server for interested people."I just saw my role in this as someone who is going to be there to support them and be kind of a figurehead for American students to gather support," Anguiano said. "From the beginning, it wasn't about me. It was about the people from Hong Kong."Second-year geology major Winnie Lau was one of the first people involved with Davis4HK, a group of students supporting Hong Kong. Lau is an international student from Hong Kong, and she recalled learning about the protests in her home country while she was taking finals in the spring of 2019."On the 9th of June, I watched the live stream for the first protest," Lau said. "A million people came on the street. And then on the 12th of June, the police started to use tear gas to attack people. I was heartbroken at that time. And not only tear gas, they even used rubber bullets, [...] so I was shocked."Tensions on campusSince the inception of Davis4HK, there has been notable on-campus dissent - coming from students from mainland China.On the night of Oct. 9, third-year aerospace engineering major Harsh, who requested to be referred to only by his first name to maintain his anonymity, wrote with chalk in support of the Hong Kong protestors in the quad. He decided to join Davis4HK that night after viewing the aforementioned Reddit video.During this time, three groups of Chinese students passed by him to erase it."Basically, a method was to just embarrass them enough until they left," Harsh said, describing how he dealt with the situation. "It just involved talking to them and trying to debate. The first few tried to stay silent and the second group was more confrontational. And the third group of people that came brought a dog to try to scare us away."A video posted on Reddit shows a Chinese student throwing a Hong Kong flag from the Davis4HK table in the trash on Thursday, Oct. 10.Later that night, at 8:45 p.m., a confrontation occurred between Harsh and international Chinese students who were wiping the chalk with water.The confrontation escalated when Harsh told the students to stop wiping the chalk and stood in front of one of the students. Both Harsh and the student, a second-year physics major who did not disclose his name, nearly began fighting. From there, the international Chinese students and Harsh began having a discussion about the protests in Hong Kong."At the beginning, we almost got into a fight - I really wanted to punch him and he really wanted to punch me," the student said. "But we peacefully dealt with it. We communicated and shared the information, then we came to an agreement that none of us know the facts."Harsh says he didn't really think things would get physical - although things started off heated, they cooled down as they talked more. When he decided to help with putting up chalk, it was with a goal of convincing the Chinese students who tore the Hong Kong signs down that what they were doing was wrong - instead of tearing signs down, they should put their own up. By the end of his conversation, he concluded that his goal was not feasible for him."After Wednesday, I thought my goal was kind of successful here, I kept the chalk up, I was able to keep three different waves of Chinese students from erasing it," Harsh said. "And then on Thursday, I had a long discussion and I realized there is no way I can convince any of these students of anything. We finished our conversation at an impasse. So I just left."Another international Chinese student who was wiping the chalk said that he was doing so because UC Davis prohibits having chalk writing on campus.Caden Zheng, a second-year physics major and international Chinese student, said he respects strikes and protests as long as they are legal."If it's legal, it's totally fine," Zheng said. "What I'm mostly against is the illegal motivations they made - the violence during the strike and the chaos they made in Hong Kong."Zheng is from mainland China but has siblings in Hong Kong."All the things happening are heartbreaking," Zheng said. "Not only do the people suffer from that, but also the city is breaking down: the economy and not many tourists are there right now. Everything happening there is dragging Hong Kong back and I don't want that to happen."The students, including Zheng, who were opposed to the chalk writing cited university rules against using chalk on campus. The UC Davis Center for Student Involvement states that "chalking is not permitted on campus," according to its general guidelines.In response to allegations that flyers supporting Hong Kong protestors were being taken down, Zheng disagreed with individuals taking down the flyers as long as the flyers were posted according to university rules and policies. In a later email, Zheng reiterated his point but made note of flyers he believed to be breaking some of the rules in the general guidelines."I agree and respect all the people on this campus should have the freedom of speech, I agree any people on this campus have the right to express their opinion, even if I do not agree with some of their opinions," Zheng said via email. "If the poster was posted in the proper way (obey the Posting of Information Policy and Procedure Manual), then I strongly agree it should not be taken off. However, there are many posters I saw, break the Posting Policy General Guidelines No.3, No.4 and No.5."One of the students wiping the chalk, who requested to remain anonymous, also agreed that individuals should not be taking flyers down that were put up according to university policy."For the flyer, while we're sorry for the people who took it off, but we understand it, because it is our country being insulted," the student said. "Even though the action is not correct, it is understandable. If you really want to act against it, you need to post another one. We should do it in the right way or we would just be the same as the people who commit violence in Hong Kong."Zheng expressed discontent over the student who confronted them because the student has not been to Hong Kong and may not have full knowledge of what is going on in Hong Kong."The American who chalked down words, I don't really like that, since he's American and he hasn't been to Hong Kong," Zheng said. "I believe that he doesn't really know what's really happening, since he hasn't seen it, but I was there during the strike. If you really want to do something just because you think you are right, I don't think you should do it. You have to have some evidence to support you."Zheng called for a return to a peaceful campus and hopes to find out the full truth of what is happening in Hong Kong."What I really want is a peaceful and joyful campus life," Zheng said. "I love China, I love Hong Kong and I also love America and UC Davis. What I really want is the truth - I just want to know what's happening and I want to maybe talk to different people from Hong Kong, people here in America and people from other countries to hear what their perspective is."Lau, in addition to multiple students from Davis4HK, emphasized that she is not angry or resentful towards the dissenting students from mainland China."I will say I won't be mad at them and I won't be angry at them because of the behavior, because it is understandable." Lau said. "But I feel like there is just a misunderstanding [...] We are just trying to fight for freedom and fight for democracy. We are not fighting against Chinese people. We are just fighting against a system and a government."Student activists appeal to state representativesDespite the opposition the group faced, Davis4HK gathered nearly 1,000 signatures for letters imploring members of Congress to pass H.R. 3289 (Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019) between Oct. 10 and Oct. 12. On Oct. 14, members of Davis4HK attended U.S. Rep. John Garamendi's town hall at the Veterans Memorial Center. They presented him 373 letters from his constituents and he committed to supporting the bill."To all of you back there that have decided that this is important enough for you to come here today, I thank you," Garamendi said during the town hall. "And as we talk about what we can do here and across the nation, that is not only to support Hong Kong, but to support people everywhere in the world that are fighting for democratic values."On Oct. 15, the bill passed in the House and was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under general orders.The actual protest began at 3 p.m. on Oct. 16 with an introduction of events and a moment of silence for those who lost their lives or were imprisoned during the protests in Hong Kong. Third-year history and economics major William Jung spoke at the event, as did Anguiano, Lau, a graduate student from Hong Kong and an undergraduate student who wore a gas mask, goggles and a helmet and did not want to be identified. This was followed by the singing of "Glory to Hong Kong" in Cantonese and English and "Do You Hear the People Sing." There was also an open mic portion, during which Davis4HK invited students to speak for up to two minutes.Lau's speech was interrupted by Mandarin-speaking students who screamed profanities, according to fourth-year Chinese major Mark Godges. Godges was visibly upset by the incident and responded to the students."I have no problem with mainland Chinese students in general, but someone who I assume was a mainland Chinese nationalist came into our circle, and I thought that was extremely disrespectful," Godges said. "And then in Chinese he basically said, 'F- you, Hong Kong is a part of China.' Then I just yelled, and I responded in Chinese [...] to him and I was like, 'No, Hong Kong is not a part of China. If China continues to disrespect human rights, they will split. Respect human rights.'"Godges became involved with Davis4HK when he saw the posts of someone he followed on Instagram. He met with the group a few times, and he "got really fired up." He wrote a song in Mandarin and English that he performed during the open mic portion of the protest after the conclusion of the speeches."It was about the fact that the United States and countries and leaders around the world who believe in upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to the United Nations will not be bullied by the Communist Party," Godges said. "And that includes the brave protesters in Hong Kong."When the Mandarin-speaking students and Godges started interacting, Anguiano was concerned about the possibility of a physical altercation. He believes that fostering conversation would be an effective way to deal with the tension."As long as we're able to keep a professional conversation going and stray away from any physical violence - I saw that it could have happened here, and I'm so glad it did not," Anguiano said. "If, at any point, any mainland [Chinese] student is willing to sit down and talk to us, we're more than willing and that's something that we want to see. That's why when we had the open mic here as well, that was something that we really wanted to encourage - if there was somebody who opposed this movement, we want them to feel like we're not pushing against their freedom to speak."Other members of Davis4HK who also followed the protests from the beginning include Ben, a student who requested that he only be referred to by his first name to prevent his family from being identified. He commented on the incident that occurred during Lau's speech."When something like this happens, it's just kind of natural for dissent to come up," Ben said. "Especially when to [dissenters], this is a controversial topic because it's against what they're taught. They just yelled some pretty vulgar stuff in Mandarin. And it was kind of uncalled for because we were just talking, just giving speeches. One of them was 'f- your mom' in Mandarin."Jung emphasized that the dissenters are entitled to their beliefs, but he wishes they were more open to engaging in conversation. He noted that none of the students who interrupted Lau's speech took the opportunity to speak during the open mic portion of the event."I mean, do I like those words? No, but it's legal," Jung said. "We have free speech on this campus. We get to share ideas, our university is about that. I'm glad UC Davis stands for that. [Dissenters] are entitled to say that, and while I hope they would be more cordial in their discussions and try to interact with us instead of heckling us, they are entitled to do that."Lau wanted to emphasize that Hong Kong isn't the only place dealing with the kind of violence that it is."There are many, many places and people around the globe also suffering from that," Lau said. "So I just want to say [that] Hong Kong people are just the front line of this battle."Anguiano emphasized that just like Lau, he has heard some misconceptions about the protest."I just really want to make sure that people know that the Hong Kong movement is not a separatist movement," Anguiano said. "It is a movement for democracy and just treatment for the people who feel like their civil liberties are being encroached on by the Chinese government. I just want to make sure that that's something that is expressed. I know that there's a lot of dissent against this movement [because it's seen] as a separatist movement when it's really not." Written by: Anjini Venugopal and Sabrina Habchi -features@theaggie.orgLoad-Date: October 28, 2019End of Document

By the way, the same report suggested China has no intention of making any concessions on key structural issues, which would include things like intellectual property protection and ending subsidies of state-owned businesses.Why would the market react so positively to a report such as this?Yesterday, there was a sense nothing would come out of this week's negotiations, so this report leaves the door cracked for at least something good to happen.Stocks sold off sharply Tuesday after the U.S. blacklisted 28 more Chinese government and commercial firms and imposed a visa ban on officials who have allegedly committed human rights violations against Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.With a 2.0% decline already this week, and a drop below the 50-day moving average and 2900 level, the S&P 500 was presumably primed for a rebound try. This hopeful-sounding headline has created a spark to get one going.Trading algorithms have dictated the positive response given the positive-sounding context of the report.The overnight low in the S&P futures was 2888, which probed the lows seen in August when stocks were in a retreat phase. Accordingly, some technical price action is likely factoring into things. The futures market had already rebounded approximately 18 points two hours prior to the Bloomberg News report being posted.China's willingness to do a "partial deal" is well short of President Trump's desire to get a complete deal, so market participants need to stay on guard for subsequent reports today that might imply China's approach coming into Washington isn't good enough.As it stands now, the futures tone is good enough for a solid opening even though China's negotiating posture, based on the Bloomberg News item, isn't all that solid in the grand scheme of things.07:57WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +25.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +83.50.U.S. futures are up nicely on news that China is interested in reaching a partial trade deal with the U.S. The S&P 500 futures trade 25 points, or 0.9%, above fair value.An unnamed official with direct knowledge of the talks told Bloomberg that terms would include President Trump not imposing any additional tariffs, including the increase in tariff rates next week and in December. Beijing would offer to buy more agricultural products in exchange without addressing any structural trade issues. The Financial Times reported that soybean purchases could increase by 10 million tons annually.Walking out of the 13th round of trade talks without resolving any core issues and keeping tariff rates unchanged seems underwhelming compared to the complete deal that President Trump has been wanting. Nevertheless, there was some angst yesterday about those tariff-rate hikes taking effect this year.Today's economic calendar will feature the minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, which will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.

This award for a single plaintiff stands in stark contrast with the initial $680,000 compensatory award and is a clear violation of due process. United States Supreme Court precedent dictates that punitive damages awards that are a double-digit multiplier of the compensatory award should be set aside. The Company was precluded from presenting a meaningful defense due to the Court's exclusion of key evidence. As a result, the jury did not hear evidence as to how the label for RISPERDAL clearly and appropriately outlined the risks associated with the medicine, or the benefits RISPERDAL provides to patients with serious mental illness. Further, the plaintiff's attorneys failed to present any evidence that the plaintiff was actually harmed by the alleged conduct. This decision is inconsistent with multiple determinations outside of Philadelphia regarding the adequacy of the RISPERDAL labeling, the medicine's efficacy, and findings in support of the Company. We will be immediately moving to set aside this excessive and unfounded verdict."Shares are currently down 2% in extended trading.07:30SUMRX European Markets Update: DAX +1.0%, FTSE +0.5%, CAC +0.7%Major European indices trade higher across the board.

The lower silver and gold production in Q3, 2019 compared to Q3, 2018 were due to the planned reduction of mine output at El Cubo and lower throughput and grades at Bolanitos, partly offset by higher production at Guanacevi and new production at El Compas.

Passenger unit revenue (PRASK) for the third quarter is expected to be up approximately 20% yr/yr. For the quarter ended in September, GOL expects unit revenue (RASK) to increase approximately 19%. Non-fuel unit costs (CASK ex-fuel) are expected to increase by approximately 15% in relation to the third quarter of the prior year, primarily due to increases in payroll tax rates due to the elimination of the Payroll Tax Relief Program, increased commissions due to increased forward sales, increases in landing and navigation expenses due to a 10% increase in rates, increases in depreciation from six net additional aircraft in the fleet, and costs associated with MAX aircraft delivery delays. Fuel unit costs (CASK fuel) are expected to decrease by approximately 7% year over year, negatively impacted by a 1.3% increase in fuel consumption per flight hour from the delayed delivery of MAX aircraft in the quarter. GOL's financial leverage, as measured by the Net Debt4/LTM EBITDA ratio, was approximately 2.9x at the end of the September 2019 quarter.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (-1.7%), and Russell 2000 (-1.7%) also posted sizable losses to close near session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department placed 28 more Chinese firms on its Entity List for their role in fostering violations of human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied the allegations and warned about possible retaliation, with a report suggesting China could even leave this week's discussions one day early.Selling pressure appeared to level off after China's Global Times reported that China remains sincere in reaching a comprehensive deal and intends on proceeding "calmly." Stocks then cut losses after Fed Chair Powell said the Fed plans on expanding its balance sheet, but quickly faded into the close on news that the U.S. will impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to the human rights abuses.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower in a risk-off session. Nine sectors lost at least 1.0%, including a 2.0% drop in the financials sector. The real estate sector (-0.5%) declined the least.A disappointing outcome in trade talks was likely being priced in but also the likelihood that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15, as planned. In other words, the trade uncertainty continued to dampen the growth outlook for the economy and corporate earnings.Many of the China-sensitive semiconductor stocks, including Ambarella (AMBA 51.79, -5.43, -9.5%), underperformed as many of these companies derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.1% on Tuesday.U.S. Treasuries ended a volatile session on a higher note amid growth concerns and an unexpected decline in producer prices for September. The 2-yr yield declined four basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.54%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 99.13. WTI crude declined 0.3%, or $0.13, to $52.66/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, the JOLTS - Job Openings report for August, the Wholesale Inventories report for August, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +17.9% YTDS&P 500 +15.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.2% YTDRussell 2000 +9.2% YTD16:19DBVT DBV Technologies launches proposed global offering of ordinary shares of up to $125 mln (7.35 -0.87)16:17IP Int'l Paper raises quarterly dividend by 2.5% to $0.5125, new dividend yield is 5.3% (38.42 -0.69)16:17JRVR James River Group delivered notice of early insurance cancellation to its largest customer Rasier - account has not met co's expectations for profitability (48.94 -1.10)All insurance policies related to this customer are included in the Company's commercial auto line of business within its Excess and Surplus Lines segment, and a majority of the insurance policies were due to expire on February 29, 2020.

Currently, the S&P futures are trading 1.0% above fair value.The report was sourced to "an official with direct knowledge of the talks." By the way, the same report suggested China has no intention of making any concessions on key structural issues, which would include things like intellectual property protection and ending subsidies of state-owned businesses.Why would the market react so positively to a report such as this?Yesterday, there was a sense nothing would come out of this week's negotiations, so this report leaves the door cracked for at least something good to happen.Stocks sold off sharply Tuesday after the U.S. blacklisted 28 more Chinese government and commercial firms and imposed a visa ban on officials who have allegedly committed human rights violations against Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.With a 2.0% decline already this week, and a drop below the 50-day moving average and 2900 level, the S&P 500 was presumably primed for a rebound try. This hopeful-sounding headline has created a spark to get one going.Trading algorithms have dictated the positive response given the positive-sounding context of the report.The overnight low in the S&P futures was 2888, which probed the lows seen in August when stocks were in a retreat phase. Accordingly, some technical price action is likely factoring into things. The futures market had already rebounded approximately 18 points two hours prior to the Bloomberg News report being posted.China's willingness to do a "partial deal" is well short of President Trump's desire to get a complete deal, so market participants need to stay on guard for subsequent reports today that might imply China's approach coming into Washington isn't good enough.As it stands now, the futures tone is good enough for a solid opening even though China's negotiating posture, based on the Bloomberg News item, isn't all that solid in the grand scheme of things.07:57WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +25.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +83.50.U.S. futures are up nicely on news that China is interested in reaching a partial trade deal with the U.S. The S&P 500 futures trade 25 points, or 0.9%, above fair value.An unnamed official with direct knowledge of the talks told Bloomberg that terms would include President Trump not imposing any additional tariffs, including the increase in tariff rates next week and in December. Beijing would offer to buy more agricultural products in exchange without addressing any structural trade issues. The Financial Times reported that soybean purchases could increase by 10 million tons annually.Walking out of the 13th round of trade talks without resolving any core issues and keeping tariff rates unchanged seems underwhelming compared to the complete deal that President Trump has been wanting. Nevertheless, there was some angst yesterday about those tariff-rate hikes taking effect this year.Today's economic calendar will feature the minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, which will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.

This award for a single plaintiff stands in stark contrast with the initial $680,000 compensatory award and is a clear violation of due process. United States Supreme Court precedent dictates that punitive damages awards that are a double-digit multiplier of the compensatory award should be set aside. The Company was precluded from presenting a meaningful defense due to the Court's exclusion of key evidence. As a result, the jury did not hear evidence as to how the label for RISPERDAL clearly and appropriately outlined the risks associated with the medicine, or the benefits RISPERDAL provides to patients with serious mental illness. Further, the plaintiff's attorneys failed to present any evidence that the plaintiff was actually harmed by the alleged conduct. This decision is inconsistent with multiple determinations outside of Philadelphia regarding the adequacy of the RISPERDAL labeling, the medicine's efficacy, and findings in support of the Company. We will be immediately moving to set aside this excessive and unfounded verdict."Shares are currently down 2% in extended trading.07:30SUMRX European Markets Update: DAX +1.0%, FTSE +0.5%, CAC +0.7%Major European indices trade higher across the board.

Passenger unit revenue (PRASK) for the third quarter is expected to be up approximately 20% yr/yr. For the quarter ended in September, GOL expects unit revenue (RASK) to increase approximately 19%. Non-fuel unit costs (CASK ex-fuel) are expected to increase by approximately 15% in relation to the third quarter of the prior year, primarily due to increases in payroll tax rates due to the elimination of the Payroll Tax Relief Program, increased commissions due to increased forward sales, increases in landing and navigation expenses due to a 10% increase in rates, increases in depreciation from six net additional aircraft in the fleet, and costs associated with MAX aircraft delivery delays. Fuel unit costs (CASK fuel) are expected to decrease by approximately 7% year over year, negatively impacted by a 1.3% increase in fuel consumption per flight hour from the delayed delivery of MAX aircraft in the quarter. GOL's financial leverage, as measured by the Net Debt4/LTM EBITDA ratio, was approximately 2.9x at the end of the September 2019 quarter.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (-1.7%), and Russell 2000 (-1.7%) also posted sizable losses to close near session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department placed 28 more Chinese firms on its Entity List for their role in fostering violations of human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied the allegations and warned about possible retaliation, with a report suggesting China could even leave this week's discussions one day early.Selling pressure appeared to level off after China's Global Times reported that China remains sincere in reaching a comprehensive deal and intends on proceeding "calmly." Stocks then cut losses after Fed Chair Powell said the Fed plans on expanding its balance sheet, but quickly faded into the close on news that the U.S. will impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to the human rights abuses.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower in a risk-off session. Nine sectors lost at least 1.0%, including a 2.0% drop in the financials sector. The real estate sector (-0.5%) declined the least.A disappointing outcome in trade talks was likely being priced in but also the likelihood that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15, as planned. In other words, the trade uncertainty continued to dampen the growth outlook for the economy and corporate earnings.Many of the China-sensitive semiconductor stocks, including Ambarella (AMBA 51.79, -5.43, -9.5%), underperformed as many of these companies derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.1% on Tuesday.U.S. Treasuries ended a volatile session on a higher note amid growth concerns and an unexpected decline in producer prices for September. The 2-yr yield declined four basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.54%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 99.13. WTI crude declined 0.3%, or $0.13, to $52.66/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, the JOLTS - Job Openings report for August, the Wholesale Inventories report for August, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +17.9% YTDS&P 500 +15.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.2% YTDRussell 2000 +9.2% YTD16:19DBVT DBV Technologies launches proposed global offering of ordinary shares of up to $125 mln (7.35 -0.87)16:17IP Int'l Paper raises quarterly dividend by 2.5% to $0.5125, new dividend yield is 5.3% (38.42 -0.69)16:17JRVR James River Group delivered notice of early insurance cancellation to its largest customer Rasier - account has not met co's expectations for profitability (48.94 -1.10)All insurance policies related to this customer are included in the Company's commercial auto line of business within its Excess and Surplus Lines segment, and a majority of the insurance policies were due to expire on February 29, 2020.

CAMBRIDGE AND NANJING BREAK GROUND ON 'SMART CITIES' CENTREStates News ServiceSeptember 10, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 748 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: CAMBRIDGE, UK BodyThe following information was released by the University of Cambridge:Cambridge Vice-Chancellor Professor Stephen J Toope joined Zhang Jinghua, Party Secretary of Nanjing City Party Committee and Nanjing Deputy Mayor Jiang Yuejian to turn the first soil at the site where the Centre's dedicated building will rise in Nanjing's Jiangbei New Area.The Cambridge University-Nanjing Centre of Technology and Innovation will establish a home for joint research and innovation in collaboration with the Chinese government, industry and China's global research universities that is dedicated to the future of creating 'smart' cities."Here in Nanjing, an ancient city and former imperial capital, we are embarking on a unique enterprise," Vice-Chancellor Toope said at the groundbreaking ceremony. "The innovations emerging from this Centre will enable the development of 'smart' cities in which censors can enable sustainable lifestyles, improve healthcare, limit pollution and make efficient use of energy."Cambridge and its Chinese partners will share revenue derived from the commercialisation of Intellectual Property (IP) developed at the Centre. It is the University's first overseas enterprise at this scale.Funded by the Nanjing Municipality for its first five years, the project will have its own dedicated building as a pilot urban development based on high levels of technological innovation.At the heart of the new Centre's activities will be research into technologies that support a modern 21st century city with integrated IT, health care and building management. Innovations emerging from the Centre will enable the development of 'smart' cities in which sensors applied at the individual level and all the way through to the level of large infrastructure will enable sustainable lifestyles.As well as supporting health and wellbeing in new cities, the new Centre will help deliver efficient energy use through its academic and entrepreneurial activities.The agreement between Cambridge and Nanjing will fund positions in Nanjing, both academic and management, and will allow Cambridge-based academics to engage with specific, long-term projects in Nanjing. It will also support the establishment of a professorship, based in Cambridge, with responsibility as the Centre's Academic Director.The project has been driven by Cambridge's Department of Engineering, although it is hoped that there will be opportunities to widen participation to other departments and Schools. IP generated by research funded through the Centre will be licensed for commercialisation by Cambridge University's innovation branch, Cambridge Enterprise.The Centre will seek to demonstrate the power of collaboration with China's universities, industry, government and other partners to conduct the kind of academic research of excellence today that will make life better for the city dwellers of tomorrow.One of the two initial projects already approved is to create a high resolution scanner that can provide a low-cost easily accessible method for examining difficult areas of the body, such as bent spines, without using large and expensive CT scans.That project will be led by Cambridge Engineering Department Professor Richard Prager, in collaboration with China's Southeast University and established local ultrasonic manufacturer Vinno.A second identified project led by Principal Investigator Professor Toni Vidal-Puig from Cambridge's Clinical Biochemistry Department, will study the associated complications of increased obesity in China.Both themes are closely linked to the focus area of local partner, NIHA (Nanjing International Healthcare Area).The Vice-Chancellor was joined at the groundbreaking ceremony by representatives from partners Nanjing University, Southeast University, Peking University. Tsinghua University, Fudan University and Zheijiang University as well as Professor Daping Chu of Cambridge's Electrical Engineering Department and Pro-Vice-Chancellor for International Relations Eilis Ferran.The text in this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

STATEMENT OF GLORIA STEELE ACTING ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR, BUREAU FOR ASIA, BEFORE THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON EAST ASIA, THE PACIFIC, AND INTERNATIONAL CYBERSECURITY POLICYStates News ServiceOctober 18, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 5078 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID):Chairman Gardner, Ranking Member Markey, and Distinguished Members of the Subcommittee: Thank you for inviting me to testify on the vital role the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) plays in advancing the Administration's Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (ARIA). In Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, USAID programmed $1.236 billion in appropriated and reprogrammed development assistance to the Indo-Pacific region. I would like to thank the Committee for its leadership on ARIA, which, in setting a long-term strategic vision and a comprehensive, multifaceted, and principled United States policy for the Indo-Pacific region, sends a strong signal of bipartisan Congressional support for the IPS.As both the IPS and ARIA emphasize, it is essential to our own prosperity and security for the Indo-Pacific region to be free and open. The Indo-Pacific region is home to the world's fastest-growing markets and offers unprecedented potential to strengthen the U.S. economy while improving lives in Asia and around the world. Yet, the region's continued growthand the ability of U.S. companies to compete in the Indo-Pacific region freely and fairlyfaces deficits in citizen-responsive governance; the rule of law; and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and democratic values. These conditions also compromise stability in a region of the world that is home to the majority of humanity. As ARIA underscores, strong American leadership is needed to ensure that an international system rooted in the rule of law endures.USAID is proud to play a major role in advancing the Administration's IPS, and projecting strong American leadership on development priorities that advance U.S. economic and national security interests at the heart of ARIA. Under the IPS, the U.S. framework for the region focuses on three pillars: economics, governance, and security. In support of these core pillars, USAID's strategy to advance the IPS is structured around three objectives, all strongly endorsed by ARIA: strengthening democratic systems, fostering economic growth, and improving the management of natural resources. To advance these objectives in the Indo-Pacific region, the President's FY 2020 budget request includes a development assistance budget for USAID of $534 milliona 114 percent increase over or a more than doubling of our FY 2019 request. These objectives also go hand-in-hand with our long-standing efforts to improve the lives and well-being of people across Asia as fundamental to creating the foundations for a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific region. The President's FY 2020 budget request includes $230 million for USAID's development assistance in the Indo-Pacific region that is consistent with our vision for the Journey to Self-Reliance, such as programming in health and basic education.Within USAID's three IPS objective areas, we are sharply focused on countering the immediate- and medium-term effects of malign influences that contest our progress towards a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific region. USAID is designing and implementing development programs; taking a leading role in whole-of-U.S. Government initiatives; coordinating with like-minded donor partners, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea; and exploring potential collaboration with Taiwan. In line with ARIA, USAID is also contributing to efforts to strengthen the United States' strategic partnership with the Republic of India, an emerging regional and global leader in development, in advancing our shared objectives for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. USAID is supporting India's regional and global leadership role on combating development challenges, including bolstering the central role India plays in efforts to facilitate energy and infrastructure investment and connectivity.I will next provide a brief overview of our efforts under each of our three objectives.Strengthening Citizen-Responsive Democratic SystemsOver the last few years, democratic institutions across Asia have faced significant tests. In some places, malign influences have intervened overtly and covertly to exploit institutional weaknesses and spawn corruption, which consequently have undermined democratic institutions and the long-term stability of our partner countries. This reduces competitiveness and poses significant risks to sustainable development, autonomy of countries in the region, and citizen-responsive governance.USAID is at the forefront of the U.S. Government's efforts to address these challenges, including through the whole-of-Government Indo-Pacific Transparency Initiative. In line with ARIA, our activities include promoting the integrity of electoral processes; supporting the independence of media and the integrity of information; protecting human rights and dignity, including civil and political rights and religious freedom; fostering accountability and transparency, including by fighting corruption; improving the rule of law; and strengthening civil society.We have achieved some notable progress to date. For example, in support of transparency and accountability that elicit high-quality investment, USAID's assistance enabled the launch of a new system for vetting all major infrastructure projects proposed in Burma, known as the "Project Bank." In Republic of the Philippines, where public frustration with a slow and inefficient court system has contributed to tolerance for a harsh anti-drug campaign, USAID has introduced an e-court case-management system, now used in more than 300 trial courts, which accounts for nearly 25 percent of the country's total caseload. We have trained more than 3,000 judicial personnel. These actions are equipping the courts to handle cases more transparently, efficiently, and expeditiously. For example, the average age of pending cases in the courts that receive U.S. assistance has been reduced by over 40 percent, from four years to just over two years.Bolstering the United States' strategic partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a priority of ARIA. Similarly, the IPS acknowledges ASEAN as a cornerstone of the U.S. vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. Over the years, USAID has worked extensively with ASEAN at both the multilateral and bilateral levels to advance shared priorities, and we are committed to strengthening this partnership. USAID is in the process of negotiating a comprehensive development cooperation agreement with ASEAN to deepen our relationship. Through USAID programs, we provide technical assistance to ASEAN on a range of key regional policies to address transnational challenges that threaten regional stability and growth. In partnership with the State Department, our engagement with ASEAN on a range of regional policies, including those that promote human rights, improve transparency, and fight corruption, provide an opportunity for the United States to influence ASEAN's dialogue on advancing a rules-based architecture that furthers regional integration.In Mongolia, we are helping up-and-coming local leadersincluding students, academics, government officials, civil-society activists, and businessmen and womenunderstand and value democracy as they champion effective, citizen-responsive, and accountable governance. We have launched new programs in Burma and The Philippines to expand public access to credible information. In the Kingdom of Cambodia, where the United States remains committed to supporting the Cambodian people in protecting their fundamental freedoms, USAID partners have provided legal counseling over the past year to around 40 human-rights defenders and land, environmental, and political activists subjected by the government to politically motivated charges for their work.In Timor-Leste, years of USAID's assistance led to a significant breakthrough in 2017, when the country ran national elections for the first time in history without international supervision, and in 2018, when the country peacefully navigated its first snap election after the new Parliament was dissolved for failing to pass a budget. In the Republic of Indonesia, the number of people from marginalized communities who sought legal aid through USAID partners increased more than tenfold between 2017 and 2018 thanks to our advocacy and technical assistance, which contributed to expanded access to justice for the most vulnerable. With your support, we seek to build on successes like these.Finally, I'd like to mention the crisis in Xinjiang, which remains one of the Administration's top priorities. The United States is outraged by the Chinese Government's highly repressive campaign of human rights abuses against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims and other religious and ethnic minorities. The Chinese Government has, by U.S. Government estimates, detained more than one million individuals in internment camps since April 2017. USAID is in the process of conducting a needs assessment to inform the design of new rapid-response programs to support Xinjiang refugee communities outside of China.Fostering Economic GrowthA key constraint to the region's continued growth is the tremendous financing shortfall it faces for its infrastructure needs, which amounts to $1.7 trillion per year from 2016 to 2030. According to the Asian Development Bank, fiscal reforms could help bridge about 40 percent of Asia's gap in financing for infrastructure. But the remainder depends on the private sector, which would need to increase its funding contributions by about 300 percent compared to current levels. However, a number of conditions impede free and fair competition and unhindered market access for legitimate investors, such as inadequate fiscal space, weak policies, and corruption in government procurement.In line with ARIA, USAID is helping governments, civil society, the private sector, and partner countries overcome these constraints to growth by working to ensure that their legal, regulatory, and policy environments for trade, infrastructure, and investment are transparent, open, and free of corruption. Specifically, USAID's assistance is leveling the playing field by developing the capacity of partner governments to enforce contractual agreements under international trade arrangements; meet internationally accepted standards for intellectual property, labor, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and address technical barriers to trade; and promote trade facilitation by easing border controls and compliance requirements.USAID is also improving competitiveness through support for bilateral programs that reduce barriers to entry and market access by legitimate commercial investors; lower the cost of doing business by streamlining procedures and cutting red tape for obtaining permits and licenses, easing labor market restrictions, and strengthening the enforcement of contracts; and promote greater competition by reforming procurement rules to allow legitimate players to participate, strengthening antitrust and competition requirements, promoting conformance with standards following international best practices, and strengthening the enforcement of intellectual-property rights.We seek to build on our past success, such as our work in the Philippines that has helped eight secondary cities become more competitive, according to the Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index. Developed with USAID assistance, the index is an annual ranking of Philippine cities and municipalities, based on each city's economic dynamism, government efficiency, and infrastructure. Across the eight cities, USAID has helped lower the cost of doing business, thanks to a reduction in the business-registration process from as many as 20 steps in 2014 to as few as two steps today.A key feature of our collaboration with the cities in the Philippines is to promote investment to bolster and sustain development efforts. For example, last month, USAID supported Puerto Princesa City in attracting private-sector pledges amounting to $540 million worth of investments in sectors including tourism, food, agriculture, fisheries, and educationcommercial investments that help Puerto Princesa fulfill its potential as an engine of sustainable, inclusive growth for the country.Incentivizing greater private sector investment helps unlock new financing streamsand greater choice of approaches and partnersfor development. As part of our efforts to unlock enterprise-led economic growth, we are helping to advance open, interoperable, reliable, and secure communications networks in partner countries through the U.S. Government's Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership (DCCP).We also play a leading role in strengthening the ability of governments and the private sector in our partner countries to implement and manage sustainable, transparent, and high-quality infrastructure projects through the U.S. Government's Infrastructure Transaction and Assistance Network (ITAN). For example, in the Republic of the Maldives, USAID is providing technical assistance to the government on public financial management best practices for responsible resource-allocation in its annual budget. In addition, USAID is helping to prioritize public infrastructure investments, explore opportunities for public-private partnerships, and promote procurement reform. By the end of this year, USAID will also start providing the Government of Maldives technical assistance on mobilizing domestic resources. In the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, we are advising the government on implementing its Power Development Plan and attracting private-sector investment. And in the Philippines, we have launched a new project focused on increasing technical assistance to support the country's ambitious infrastructure development strategy. Our efforts under DCCP and ITAN include advancing best-value analysis, open and transparent procurement processes, and adherence to high standards.We are making significant progress. For example, in Vietnam, we recently launched a new trade facilitation program that will build the capacity of Vietnam's customs department to comply with global trade norms. Our efforts will help reduce the time and cost of trade and increase capacity to address the inappropriate transshipment of Chinese goods through Vietnam to avoid U.S.-imposed tariffs.We also are helping to advance the integration of the Lao People's Democratic Republic into the global market economy. USAID's support led to the approval by the Lao National Assembly of amendments to the Law on Intellectual Property that increase transparency and due process. For instance, the Lao Government will publish applications for patents and trademarks electronically, which will allow access to this information by interested parties in a more readily accessible format.In Timor-Leste, we have helped the customs authority cut clearance times in half at the seaport in Dili, and a national risk-management system for cargo inspection we introduced is moving the customs authority toward compliance with international standards required for accession to the World Customs Organization, the World Trade Organization, and ASEAN.In partnership with ASEAN, we are developing the ASEAN Single Window (ASW), a tool to accelerate trade among the organization's ten Member States. We are also working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to develop a clearance process for U.S. goods through the ASW.In the Philippines, our long-standing relationships continue to pay dividends for U.S. companies. Previous USAID programming helped lead to the issuance of the Open Skies policy, which highlighted the increased demand for additional international airports in Metro Manila. In August 2019, Texas-based Jacobs was one of three companies selected to design and build the proposed $14.7 billion new Bulacan International Airport, located outside of Manila.Improving the Management of Natural ResourcesThe Indo-Pacific region is rich in forests, fisheries, and other natural resources, including energy, which are vital for countries' long-term growthas are water, land, and clean air. The region's incredible biodiversity includes the world's largest concentration of marine life, and the world's largest area of mangrove forests. Yet the sustainability of these natural resourcesand the vulnerable communities that depend on them for their livelihoodsface the threat of irresponsible infrastructure development and the reckless extraction of resources that ignore environmental and social safeguards. Furthermore, high rates of transnational crime in Asia are associated with fishing, logging, and wildlife, and contribute to rapid environmental degradation, while also undermining the regional stability that underpins a free and open Indo-Pacific region.In line with ARIA, USAID works with governments and civil society in countries across the region to strengthen the responsible management of natural resources. We help strengthen laws on the management of natural resources and promote the adoption and enforcement of environmental standards that reflect international best practices. We foster engagement with the private sector on sustainable supply-chains and the transformation of the energy sector. We focus on supporting water and energy security, legal and sustainable fishing and timber production, and efforts to combat transnational environmental crime.For example, as this Subcommittee well knows, unsound infrastructure development along the Mekong River in Southeast Asia is causing irreversible damage to the Mekong ecosystem, which threatens the food, water, and livelihoods of more than 70 million people. Last year, USAID launched a three-year project that aims to reduce the negative impact of infrastructure development in the Lower Mekong region through the stronger, more-consistent application of environmental and social safeguards. As part of the project, we are developing and gearing up to launch an interactive, web-based platform that will enable governments, policy-makers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), researchers, and the general public to visually map the potential extent and range of socioeconomic and environmental impacts of different infrastructure approaches.To combat transnational wildlife crime, USAID is contributing to broader U.S. Government efforts, in partnership with INTERPOL, that are helping to dismantle cross-continental syndicates that traffic in elephant ivory and pangolin. Our partnership with INTERPOL is also disrupting illegal fishing networks, including the recent confiscation by Indonesian authorities of over 350,000 juvenile lobsters worth $4 million that were en route to Singapore and Vietnam. In addition to this, last year, to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, USAID worked with the first group of 27 companies to roll out and test traceability technology in the Republic of Indonesia and The Philippineswhich has resulted in the successful tracking of more than 4.4 million pounds of seafood from point-of-catch to export.On energy, USAID plays a leading role in Asia EDGE (Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy), a U.S. Government initiative that works to grow sustainable and secure energy markets throughout the Indo-Pacific region. As part of our contribution to Asia EDGE, we recently launched a partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to mobilize $7 billion in investments to accelerate the region's transition to a sustainable, secure, market-driven energy sector. Our partnership with the ADB aims to increase the capacity of deployed energy systems by six gigawatts and increase regional energy trade by 10 percent over the next five years. This reinforces an explicit clause in ARIA that states that the United States should explore opportunities to partner with the private sector and multilateral institutions, such as the ADB, to promote universal access to reliable electricity in the Indo-Pacific region.Alongside Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, we are also contributing to the U.S. Government's efforts under the Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership to provide electricity to 70 percent of that country's population by 2030. USAID Administrator Mark Green was proud to announce the U.S. Government's first tranche of funding toward this effort at the United Nations General Assembly last month.Our financial and technical support has contributed to critical steps forward in our partner countries. For example, in Vietnam, where the demand for energy is expected to more than double by 2030, USAID is working closely with the Government to develop and implement policies that support scaling up the generation of renewable energy. This has contributed to a massive increase in solar energy production over the past two yearsfrom less than 2 percent of the country's total power-generation to over 10 percent. USAID is also engaging with the private sector to accelerate clean energy and increase the deployment of new energy technologies. In May 2019, the Ha Do Group, one of USAID's partners, completed construction of its first solar-power farm in Vietnam by using services and advanced technology from SunPower, a U.S. leader in solar energy.In Indonesia, USAID's work helping countries overcome their energy-related constraints to growth is unlocking new market opportunities, including for U.S. companies. For example, in partnership with the California Independent System Operator, which manages about 80 percent of California's electricity flow, and Indonesia's national power utility, USAID is supporting the integration of variable renewable energy into Indonesian power grids. This work has paved the way for the development of Indonesia's first two utility-scale wind farmsby Colorado-based UPC Renewables, and Vena Energy, a subsidiary of the New York-based equity fund, Global Infrastructure Partners. During FY 2018 in Indonesia, 11 renewable energy projects to which USAID provided technical advisory services reached financial closure, successfully mobilizing a combined $806 million in investments from the public and private sectors.USAID assistance in creating an enabling environment for regional power trade in South Asia has led to transformative policy changes. For example, a revision the Indian Government made in December 2018 to its guidelines on cross-border power trade led to a June 2019 agreement between the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal and the People's Republic of Bangladesh to trade power using Indian transmission lines.USAID's efforts under Asia EDGE build on our past successes. Nepal's significant untapped hydropower potentialcoupled with insatiable demand for energy from neighboring Indiaholds substantial economic promise. To help unleash investment in this area, USAID helped the Government of Nepal to improve the energy sector's legal and regulatory framework. Our efforts contributed to the successful passage of legislation that established the Electricity Regulatory Commission in 2017. To lay the foundation for the $500 million Millenium Challenge Corporation Compact, USAID trained 390 government officials on the technical aspects of clean energy; we are helping several hydropower projects to finalize and secure the necessary investments to begin construction; and we are supporting the newly-appointed energy regulatory commissioners to ensure that they have the skills and resources necessary to help Nepal realize its vast and largely untapped energy potential.Journey to Self-RelianceAt USAID, our ultimate goal is for our partner countries to progress from being aid recipients, to partners, to fellow donors. We look forward to the day when foreign assistance is no longer necessary. We call the path to get there the "Journey to Self-Reliance."In support of this, USAID is realigning and reorienting its policies, strategies, and programmatic practices to improve how it works with governments, civil society, faith-based organizations, and the private sector to develop their capacity and commitment to drive, fund, and manage their own development. This includes commitments to open, citizen-responsive, accountable governance; inclusive growth; and the capacity to mobilize development funds domestically and through foreign direct investment. It also includes an emphasis on unlocking development driven by private enterprise to sustainand accelerateprogress.USAID's mission to advance self-reliance mutually reinforces USAID's focus under the IPSon strengthening democratic systems, fostering economic growth, and improving the management of natural resources, as described aboveto precipitate systemic change in the near-term that leaves people in our partner countries better off in the long-term.USAID prioritizes gains in health and education for development journeys to be inclusive and sustainable over generations. USAID's health and education programswhich focus on achieving longer-term goals that contribute to building human capital and economic growthare important for creating the foundation for a free and open Indo-Pacific region in the long-run. ARIA states the importance of this work in the Lower Mekong region in particular, a view that we at USAID share.We are making progress across the region, including in the Lower Mekong countries. After 15 years of funding from USAID, next year will be the first time the Cambodian Government will be able to fully own, administer, and pay for the health care for the poorest 20 percent of the population. USAID also transitioned the management and cost of several information systems to the Ministry of Health, which will allow it to track the care of its patients more effectively.In Burma, preliminary findings from a new USAID-funded national survey of the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) indicate an over 50-percent decline in the prevalence of the active form of the disease over the past decade. This progress is vital to health security in the region as Burma has a high burden of not only TB, but also multi-drug-resistant TB and co-infection of TB with HIV. In Laos, USAID has contributed to a decrease in stuntingfrom 44 percent in 2012 to 33 percent in 2018which thereby improves the development potential and economic contribution of the next generation.On education, in Cambodia, USAID's assistance strengthened early-grade reading by helping the Ministry of Education ensure that schools and policies are more inclusive, relevant, and responsive to the needs of children, in particular those with disabilities. And in Vietnam last month, we reached a turning point in that country's reform of higher education with the official launch of the undergraduate program at the USAID-funded Fulbright University Vietnam, the country's first fully independent, non-profit university. Modern, high-quality higher education is key to Vietnam's transformation to an economy that can engage in the opportunities of the fourth industrial revolution and sustain its economic growth.Throughout the region, USAID is also supporting programming focused on women's economic empowerment. For example, just last month, we were excited to sign a partial credit-guarantee agreement with Singapore-based Impact Investment Exchange (IIX). This innovative partnership will mobilize $100 million in new investment to empower women across the Indo-Pacific region. A unique financial product, the Women's Livelihood Bond 2 (WLB2), bolsters women's livelihoods through raising private financing. The proceeds of the bond will help one million underserved women in Asia secure sustainable livelihoods through investments in financial inclusion, access to clean energy, and sustainable agriculture. Long-term expected benefits include more successful women-owned businesses, greater women's participation in the workforce, higher standards of living, more opportunities for quality education, and improved health outcomes for women and children.USAID's support for WLB2 is a key deliverable under the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative (WGDP), established in February 2019 by President Donald Trump to advance women's economic empowerment globally. It also supports the Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, signed into law by President Trump in January 2019. WGDP is also supporting women's economic empowerment in Papua New Guinea, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and The Philippines.Finally, on Tibet: In line with ARIA, USAID's activities to support Tibetan communities focus on improving sustainable livelihoods and strengthening local institutions, equipping Tibetans to become effective leaders and maintain the vitality of their communities and institutions while preserving and sustaining their unique identity and culture.USAID's Mission in India currently programs the Congressional directive aimed at strengthening the self-reliance and resilience of Tibetan communities in India and Nepal. Our activities are helping them thrive economically, become effective leaders, and maintain the vitality of their communities and institutions while sustaining their unique identity and culture. We focus on increasing the financial security of Tibetan households, increasing the vitality and cohesion of Tibetan settlement communities, and increasing the effectiveness and sustainability of Tibetan institutions, in particular the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) and its various agencies. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) of China, USAID programming promotes efforts to preserve Tibetan culture and traditions and improve sustainable livelihoods for ethnic Tibetans in China.ConclusionMr. Chairman: In closing, I would once again like to thank the Committee for its championing of the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which sends a strong message of the United States' enduring commitment to the region. We are appreciative of the strong bipartisan, bicameral Congressional support for USAID's work to advance partner country self-reliance and a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific region. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward to your counsel and questions.SubjectARIA In Action, Part 3: Implementation and the Indo-Pacific StrategyChamberSenateCommitteeCommittee on Foreign RelationsLoad-Date: October 18, 2019End of Document

In partnership with the State Department, our engagement with ASEAN on a range of regional policies, including those that promote human rights, improve transparency, and fight corruption, provide an opportunity for the United States to influence ASEAN's dialogue on advancing a rules-based architecture that furthers regional integration.In Mongolia, we are helping up-and-coming local leaders--including students, academics, government officials, civil-society activists, and businessmen and women--understand and value democracy as they champion effective, citizen-responsive, and accountable governance. We have launched new programs in Burma and The Philippines to expand public access to credible information. In the Kingdom of Cambodia, where the United States remains committed to supporting the Cambodian people in protecting their fundamental freedoms, USAID partners have provided legal counseling over the past year to around 40 human-rights defenders and land, environmental, and political activists subjected by the government to politically motivated charges for their work.In Timor-Leste, years of USAID's assistance led to a significant breakthrough in 2017, when the country ran national elections for the first time in history without international supervision, and in 2018, when the country peacefully navigated its first snap election after the new Parliament was dissolved for failing to pass a budget. In the Republic of Indonesia, the number of people from marginalized communities who sought legal aid through USAID partners increased more than tenfold between 2017 and 2018 thanks to our advocacy and technical assistance, which contributed to expanded access to justice for the most vulnerable. With your support, we seek to build on successes like these.Finally, I'd like to mention the crisis in Xinjiang, which remains one of the Administration's top priorities. The United States is outraged by the Chinese Government's highly repressive campaign of human rights abuses against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims and other religious and ethnic minorities. The Chinese Government has, by U.S. Government estimates, detained more than one million individuals in internment camps since April 2017. USAID is in the process of conducting a needs assessment to inform the design of new rapid-response programs to support Xinjiang refugee communities outside of China.Fostering Economic GrowthA key constraint to the region's continued growth is the tremendous financing shortfall it faces for its infrastructure needs, which amounts to $1.7 trillion per year from 2016 to 2030. According to the Asian Development Bank, fiscal reforms could help bridge about 40 percent of Asia's gap in financing for infrastructure. But the remainder depends on the private sector, which would need to increase its funding contributions by about 300 percent compared to current levels. However, a number of conditions impede free and fair competition and unhindered market access for legitimate investors, such as inadequate fiscal space, weak policies, and corruption in government procurement.In line with ARIA, USAID is helping governments, civil society, the private sector, and partner countries overcome these constraints to growth by working to ensure that their legal, regulatory, and policy environments for trade, infrastructure, and investment are transparent, open, and free of corruption. Specifically, USAID's assistance is leveling the playing field by developing the capacity of partner governments to enforce contractual agreements under international trade arrangements; meet internationally accepted standards for intellectual property, labor, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and address technical barriers to trade; and promote trade facilitation by easing border controls and compliance requirements.USAID is also improving competitiveness through support for bilateral programs that reduce barriers to entry and market access by legitimate commercial investors; lower the cost of doing business by streamlining procedures and cutting red tape for obtaining permits and licenses, easing labor market restrictions, and strengthening the enforcement of contracts; and promote greater competition by reforming procurement rules to allow legitimate players to participate, strengthening antitrust and competition requirements, promoting conformance with standards following international best practices, and strengthening the enforcement of intellectual-property rights.We seek to build on our past success, such as our work in the Philippines that has helped eight secondary cities become more competitive, according to the Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index. Developed with USAID assistance, the index is an annual ranking of Philippine cities and municipalities, based on each city's economic dynamism, government efficiency, and infrastructure. Across the eight cities, USAID has helped lower the cost of doing business, thanks to a reduction in the business-registration process from as many as 20 steps in 2014 to as few as two steps today.A key feature of our collaboration with the cities in the Philippines is to promote investment to bolster and sustain development efforts. For example, last month, USAID supported Puerto Princesa City in attracting private-sector pledges amounting to $540 million worth of investments in sectors including tourism, food, agriculture, fisheries, and education--commercial investments that help Puerto Princesa fulfill its potential as an engine of sustainable, inclusive growth for the country.Incentivizing greater private sector investment helps unlock new financing streams--and greater choice of approaches and partners--for development. As part of our efforts to unlock enterprise-led economic growth, we are helping to advance open, interoperable, reliable, and secure communications networks in partner countries through the U.S. Government's Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership (DCCP).We also play a leading role in strengthening the ability of governments and the private sector in our partner countries to implement and manage sustainable, transparent, and high-quality infrastructure projects through the U.S. Government's Infrastructure Transaction and Assistance Network (ITAN). For example, in the Republic of the Maldives, USAID is providing technical assistance to the government on public financial management best practices for responsible resource-allocation in its annual budget. In addition, USAID is helping to prioritize public infrastructure investments, explore opportunities for public-private partnerships, and promote procurement reform. By the end of this year, USAID will also start providing the Government of Maldives technical assistance on mobilizing domestic resources. In the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, we are advising the government on implementing its Power Development Plan and attracting private-sector investment. And in the Philippines, we have launched a new project focused on increasing technical assistance to support the country's ambitious infrastructure development strategy. Our efforts under DCCP and ITAN include advancing best-value analysis, open and transparent procurement processes, and adherence to high standards.We are making significant progress. For example, in Vietnam, we recently launched a new trade facilitation program that will build the capacity of Vietnam's customs department to comply with global trade norms. Our efforts will help reduce the time and cost of trade and increase capacity to address the inappropriate transshipment of Chinese goods through Vietnam to avoid U.S.-imposed tariffs.We also are helping to advance the integration of the Lao People's Democratic Republic into the global market economy. USAID's support led to the approval by the Lao National Assembly of amendments to the Law on Intellectual Property that increase transparency and due process. For instance, the Lao Government will publish applications for patents and trademarks electronically, which will allow access to this information by interested parties in a more readily accessible format.In Timor-Leste, we have helped the customs authority cut clearance times in half at the seaport in Dili, and a national risk-management system for cargo inspection we introduced is moving the customs authority toward compliance with international standards required for accession to the World Customs Organization, the World Trade Organization, and ASEAN.In partnership with ASEAN, we are developing the ASEAN Single Window (ASW), a tool to accelerate trade among the organization's ten Member States. We are also working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to develop a clearance process for U.S. goods through the ASW.In the Philippines, our long-standing relationships continue to pay dividends for U.S. companies. Previous USAID programming helped lead to the issuance of the Open Skies policy, which highlighted the increased demand for additional international airports in Metro Manila. In August 2019, Texas-based Jacobs was one of three companies selected to design and build the proposed $14.7 billion new Bulacan International Airport, located outside of Manila.Improving the Management of Natural ResourcesThe Indo-Pacific region is rich in forests, fisheries, and other natural resources, including energy, which are vital for countries' long-term growth--as are water, land, and clean air. The region's incredible biodiversity includes the world's largest concentration of marine life, and the world's largest area of mangrove forests. Yet the sustainability of these natural resources--and the vulnerable communities that depend on them for their livelihoods--face the threat of irresponsible infrastructure development and the reckless extraction of resources that ignore environmental and social safeguards. Furthermore, high rates of transnational crime in Asia are associated with fishing, logging, and wildlife, and contribute to rapid environmental degradation, while also undermining the regional stability that underpins a free and open Indo-Pacific region.In line with ARIA, USAID works with governments and civil society in countries across the region to strengthen the responsible management of natural resources. We help strengthen laws on the management of natural resources and promote the adoption and enforcement of environmental standards that reflect international best practices. We foster engagement with the private sector on sustainable supply-chains and the transformation of the energy sector. We focus on supporting water and energy security, legal and sustainable fishing and timber production, and efforts to combat transnational environmental crime.For example, as this Subcommittee well knows, unsound infrastructure development along the Mekong River in Southeast Asia is causing irreversible damage to the Mekong ecosystem, which threatens the food, water, and livelihoods of more than 70 million people. Last year, USAID launched a three-year project that aims to reduce the negative impact of infrastructure development in the Lower Mekong region through the stronger, more-consistent application of environmental and social safeguards. As part of the project, we are developing and gearing up to launch an interactive, web-based platform that will enable governments, policy-makers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), researchers, and the general public to visually map the potential extent and range of socioeconomic and environmental impacts of different infrastructure approaches.To combat transnational wildlife crime, USAID is contributing to broader U.S. Government efforts, in partnership with INTERPOL, that are helping to dismantle cross-continental syndicates that traffic in elephant ivory and pangolin. Our partnership with INTERPOL is also disrupting illegal fishing networks, including the recent confiscation by Indonesian authorities of over 350,000 juvenile lobsters worth $4 million that were en route to Singapore and Vietnam. In addition to this, last year, to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, USAID worked with the first group of 27 companies to roll out and test traceability technology in the Republic of Indonesia and The Philippines--which has resulted in the successful tracking of more than 4.4 million pounds of seafood from point-of-catch to export.On energy, USAID plays a leading role in Asia EDGE (Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy), a U.S. Government initiative that works to grow sustainable and secure energy markets throughout the Indo-Pacific region. As part of our contribution to Asia EDGE, we recently launched a partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to mobilize $7 billion in investments to accelerate the region's transition to a sustainable, secure, market-driven energy sector. Our partnership with the ADB aims to increase the capacity of deployed energy systems by six gigawatts and increase regional energy trade by 10 percent over the next five years. This reinforces an explicit clause in ARIA that states that the United States should explore opportunities to partner with the private sector and multilateral institutions, such as the ADB, to promote universal access to reliable electricity in the Indo-Pacific region.Alongside Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, we are also contributing to the U.S. Government's efforts under the Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership to provide electricity to 70 percent of that country's population by 2030. USAID Administrator Mark Green was proud to announce the U.S. Government's first tranche of funding toward this effort at the United Nations General Assembly last month.Our financial and technical support has contributed to critical steps forward in our partner countries. For example, in Vietnam, where the demand for energy is expected to more than double by 2030, USAID is working closely with the Government to develop and implement policies that support scaling up the generation of renewable energy. This has contributed to a massive increase in solar energy production over the past two years--from less than 2 percent of the country's total power-generation to over 10 percent. USAID is also engaging with the private sector to accelerate clean energy and increase the deployment of new energy technologies. In May 2019, the Ha Do Group, one of USAID's partners, completed construction of its first solar-power farm in Vietnam by using services and advanced technology from SunPower, a U.S. leader in solar energy.In Indonesia, USAID's work helping countries overcome their energy-related constraints to growth is unlocking new market opportunities, including for U.S. companies. For example, in partnership with the California Independent System Operator, which manages about 80 percent of California's electricity flow, and Indonesia's national power utility, USAID is supporting the integration of variable renewable energy into Indonesian power grids. This work has paved the way for the development of Indonesia's first two utility-scale wind farms--by Colorado-based UPC Renewables, and Vena Energy, a subsidiary of the New York-based equity fund, Global Infrastructure Partners. During FY 2018 in Indonesia, 11 renewable energy projects to which USAID provided technical advisory services reached financial closure, successfully mobilizing a combined $806 million in investments from the public and private sectors.USAID assistance in creating an enabling environment for regional power trade in South Asia has led to transformative policy changes. For example, a revision the Indian Government made in December 2018 to its guidelines on cross-border power trade led to a June 2019 agreement between the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal and the People's Republic of Bangladesh to trade power using Indian transmission lines.USAID's efforts under Asia EDGE build on our past successes. Nepal's significant untapped hydropower potential--coupled with insatiable demand for energy from neighboring India--holds substantial economic promise. To help unleash investment in this area, USAID helped the Government of Nepal to improve the energy sector's legal and regulatory framework. Our efforts contributed to the successful passage of legislation that established the Electricity Regulatory Commission in 2017. To lay the foundation for the $500 million Millenium Challenge Corporation Compact, USAID trained 390 government officials on the technical aspects of clean energy; we are helping several hydropower projects to finalize and secure the necessary investments to begin construction; and we are supporting the newly-appointed energy regulatory commissioners to ensure that they have the skills and resources necessary to help Nepal realize its vast and largely untapped energy potential.Journey to Self-RelianceAt USAID, our ultimate goal is for our partner countries to progress from being aid recipients, to partners, to fellow donors. We look forward to the day when foreign assistance is no longer necessary. We call the path to get there the "Journey to Self-Reliance."In support of this, USAID is realigning and reorienting its policies, strategies, and programmatic practices to improve how it works with governments, civil society, faith-based organizations, and the private sector to develop their capacity and commitment to drive, fund, and manage their own development. This includes commitments to open, citizen-responsive, accountable governance; inclusive growth; and the capacity to mobilize development funds domestically and through foreign direct investment. It also includes an emphasis on unlocking development driven by private enterprise to sustain--and accelerate--progress.USAID's mission to advance self-reliance mutually reinforces USAID's focus under the IPS--on strengthening democratic systems, fostering economic growth, and improving the management of natural resources, as described above--to precipitate systemic change in the near-term that leaves people in our partner countries better off in the long-term.USAID prioritizes gains in health and education for development journeys to be inclusive and sustainable over generations. USAID's health and education programs--which focus on achieving longer-term goals that contribute to building human capital and economic growth--are important for creating the foundation for a free and open Indo-Pacific region in the long-run. ARIA states the importance of this work in the Lower Mekong region in particular, a view that we at USAID share.We are making progress across the region, including in the Lower Mekong countries. After 15 years of funding from USAID, next year will be the first time the Cambodian Government will be able to fully own, administer, and pay for the health care for the poorest 20 percent of the population. USAID also transitioned the management and cost of several information systems to the Ministry of Health, which will allow it to track the care of its patients more effectively.In Burma, preliminary findings from a new USAID-funded national survey of the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) indicate an over 50-percent decline in the prevalence of the active form of the disease over the past decade. This progress is vital to health security in the region as Burma has a high burden of not only TB, but also multi-drug-resistant TB and co-infection of TB with HIV. In Laos, USAID has contributed to a decrease in stunting--from 44 percent in 2012 to 33 percent in 2018--which thereby improves the development potential and economic contribution of the next generation.On education, in Cambodia, USAID's assistance strengthened early-grade reading by helping the Ministry of Education ensure that schools and policies are more inclusive, relevant, and responsive to the needs of children, in particular those with disabilities. And in Vietnam last month, we reached a turning point in that country's reform of higher education with the official launch of the undergraduate program at the USAID-funded Fulbright University Vietnam, the country's first fully independent, non-profit university. Modern, high-quality higher education is key to Vietnam's transformation to an economy that can engage in the opportunities of the fourth industrial revolution and sustain its economic growth.Throughout the region, USAID is also supporting programming focused on women's economic empowerment. For example, just last month, we were excited to sign a partial credit-guarantee agreement with Singapore-based Impact Investment Exchange (IIX). This innovative partnership will mobilize $100 million in new investment to empower women across the Indo-Pacific region. A unique financial product, the Women's Livelihood Bond 2 (WLB2), bolsters women's livelihoods through raising private financing. The proceeds of the bond will help one million underserved women in Asia secure sustainable livelihoods through investments in financial inclusion, access to clean energy, and sustainable agriculture. Long-term expected benefits include more successful women-owned businesses, greater women's participation in the workforce, higher standards of living, more opportunities for quality education, and improved health outcomes for women and children.USAID's support for WLB2 is a key deliverable under the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative (WGDP), established in February 2019 by President Donald Trump to advance women's economic empowerment globally. It also supports the Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, signed into law by President Trump in January 2019. WGDP is also supporting women's economic empowerment in Papua New Guinea, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and The Philippines.Finally, on Tibet: In line with ARIA, USAID's activities to support Tibetan communities focus on improving sustainable livelihoods and strengthening local institutions, equipping Tibetans to become effective leaders and maintain the vitality of their communities and institutions while preserving and sustaining their unique identity and culture.USAID's Mission in India currently programs the Congressional directive aimed at strengthening the self-reliance and resilience of Tibetan communities in India and Nepal. Our activities are helping them thrive economically, become effective leaders, and maintain the vitality of their communities and institutions while sustaining their unique identity and culture. We focus on increasing the financial security of Tibetan households, increasing the vitality and cohesion of Tibetan settlement communities, and increasing the effectiveness and sustainability of Tibetan institutions, in particular the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) and its various agencies. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) of China, USAID programming promotes efforts to preserve Tibetan culture and traditions and improve sustainable livelihoods for ethnic Tibetans in China.ConclusionMr. Chairman: In closing, I would once again like to thank the Committee for its championing of the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which sends a strong message of the United States' enduring commitment to the region. We are appreciative of the strong bipartisan, bicameral Congressional support for USAID's work to advance partner country self-reliance and a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific region. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward to your counsel and questions.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6915531 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 10, 2019End of Document

China's data centers emit as much carbon as 21 million carsCNN.comSeptember 9, 2019 Monday 3:30 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 603 wordsByline: By Julie Zaugg, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyChina's data centers produced 99 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, the equivalent of about 21 million cars on the road, according to a new report.Data centers store electronic information like emails, photos and videos, and worldwide they consume between 3% and 5% of total global electricity, and rival the airline industry in terms of carbon emissions.China's data center industry is among the world's largest and last year consumed just over 2% of the country's power, according to a report by Greenpeace and the North China Electric Power University.China is outpacing the US in renewable energy, and has made huge progress in developing solar projects. In 2017, it set a goal for clean energy to meet 20% of its energy needs by 2030. However, despite this vast capacity for green power, most Chinese data centers don't use it, the report said."Nearly three quarters of that power comes from coal," said Ye Ruiqi, a Greenpeace climate expert, who said that centers' reliance on coal-fired power was mostly due to their geographic location."Most facilities are located on the east coast, near business hubs and away from China's renewable energy capabilities in the center and the west of the country. Out of the 44 data centers we surveyed, only five used clean energy in their mix," she said.China's data center industry is dominated by domestic players like Alibaba and Tencent, though Apple is currently building a data center in the country's southern Guizhou Province. The joint venture with Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Company will allow the US company to improve the speed and reliability of its services, but also comply with new, tougher cybersecurity laws.Wind and solar energyWith a population of almost 1.4 million people, demand in China for data storage is growing fast.The report's authors predict that in five years' time, China's data centers will consume two-thirds more energy, putting its electricity consumption at 267 TWh in 2023, more than the total amount consumed by Australia in 2018.Carbon dioxide emissions are expected to climb from 99 million to 163 million metric tons, the same as 35 million vehicles."To prevent this, China's data centers need to decouple their electricity consumption from their carbon footprint by relying more on wind and solar energy," said Ye."They can build their own renewable energy capacity, buy clean energy on the market or purchase green certificates to offset their emissions," she added.Currently, China's data centers rely on an energy mix of 73% coal, 23% renewable energy and 4% nuclear. If renewable energy increased to 30% by 2023, 16 million metric tons of CO2 emissions could be avoided, according to Greenpeace. That's equal to 10 million round-trip transatlantic flights.But the Chinese government is aware it needs to act. In 2015, it launched a green data center pilot program. That same year, Alibaba, one of China's largest cloud computing providers, inaugurated a data center near Hangzhou, using solar energy and hydraulic power. It also relies on lake water to cool its servers.In the United States, data centers have significantly reduced their carbon footprint. All of Apple's data centers are powered by clean energy, according to the company, and its new center in China will also use some renewable energy.Microsoft and Amazon are also aiming to power their data centers by 100% renewable energy. In a blog post in April, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the company expected to pass the 70% mark by 2023. Amazon Web Services -- the company's data centers arm -- says it has exceeded 50% renewable energy usage for 2018.Load-Date: September 11, 2019End of Document

China says Apple CEO met top regulator in Beijing for a 'deep discussion'CNN WireOctober 18, 2019 Friday 12:56 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 395 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Apple CEO Tim Cook met with China's top regulator this week for a "deep discussion" about a range of issues, according to the Chinese government. The meeting between Cook and China's chief market regulator, Xiao Yaqing, took place just a few days after the company pulled HKmap, a real-time mapping app used by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.The talks covered a wide range of topics "including expanding Apple's investment and business development in China, consumer rights protection and fulfilling corporate social responsibility," according to a statement posted on the website of the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation on Friday.It did not provide further details, and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China is a key market for Apple. The company's sales in the Greater China region totaled $9.1 billion last quarter, or about 17% of its global total.It came under fire from Beijing last week for making HKmap available in the App Store. HKmap used various emojis to communicate what was happening across Hong Kong in real time: A dog marked where police officers were present; a police car showed where police vehicles were located; and a camera marked the location of a livestream. Apple pulled the app after the official newspaper of China's Communist Party accused the company of "escorting" the Hong Kong protesters in a harshly-worded commentary.Protests have been taking place in Hong Kong for months, and dozens of foreign companies that do business in mainland China and the semi-autonomous city have been caught up in the fallout.In a memo to employees last week, Cook defended the removal of HKmap, saying it had been used in ways that "endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong." The memo was anonymously posted on Pastebin, a website that allows people to post items without revealing their identities. The text was confirmed by a source with knowledge of the memo. Cook's visit to China comes days before the country is set to host global tech companies at its annual World Internet Conference. The Apple CEO attended the conference in 2017, and gave a speech about sharing the benefits of a digital economy. -- CNN Business' Laura He and Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUS.Related retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, M.Related agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS.07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019, to be slightly greater than the outlook the Company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired. S&P Futures are off by fifteen points, trading around the 2936 level. This comes after spoos put in a high of 2943.25 and a low of 2928.00.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong were closed. Chinese markets will re-open tomorrow after a week-long hiatus. In Japan, the Nikkei gave back about 0.2%, which is encouraging considering key heavyweights such as Honda and Panasonic closed about 1% lower. In Europe, the major bourses are down but having an uneventful session. Germany posted a weaker than expected Factory Orders figure for August that came in at -0.6%, after the market expected a fall of only 0.3%. This, and the early pressure in the US, has seemingly kept a lid on equity gains throughout the region.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -16.010 yr Note: 1.52%USD/JPY: 106.84 -0.06EUR/USD: 1.0971 -0.0005Europe: FTSE -0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng CLOSED Shanghai CLOSED Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1508.10 -4.80) Silver (17.50 -0.12) Crude (52.99 +0.18)18:02WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ENDP (3.82 +19.75%), ARQL (8.29 +18.43%), SRPT (88.25 +17.67%), CDNA (25.37 +16.22%), RGNX (38.49 +15.41%), ARWR (30.6 +13.5%)Materials: SBGL (6.36 +14.39%)Consumer Discretionary: TSG (20.92 +38.82%)Information Technology: RNG (163.3 +31.85%), AVYA (13.23 +28.45%), OKTA (116.53 +20.06%), COUP (148.32 +15.97%)Energy: TOO (1.53 +30.77%), DHT (6.88 +14.1%), STNG (33.65 +14.07%), FRO (10.28 +12.72%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: GTHX (23.34 -31.29%), LNTH (19.74 -22.04%), ANGO (14.6 -19.02%)Materials: SXC (5.31 -15.71%)Consumer Discretionary: GPRO (3.97 -21%), TAST (6.8 -16.46%)Information Technology: CASA (6.22 -20.47%)Financials: AMTD (33.7 -28.25%), ETFC (36.4 -15.87%)Energy: NBR (1.57 -18.65%), MDR (1.63 -18.5%), QEP (3.15 -17.54%), CDEV (3.8 -15.95%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (7.45 -34.76%), CALM (37.97 -16.4%)18:01NBIX Neurocrine Biosci presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia (89.73 -0.20)The analyses of pooled data from multiple long-term studies of the 40 mg dose showed that 53.7% of patients taking 40 mg of INGREZZA achieved an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) response (= 50% improvement from baseline) after 48 weeks of treatment.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

A survival analysis using a time-dependent Cox regression model showed that the difference in probability of survival between treated patients and untreated natural history control patients was highly statistically significant (p<0.0006). In addition to the survival benefit, the vast majority of treated patients (94.7%) had either improved (68%) or stabilized (26%) responses in major functional domains. Among clinical responders, a subset demonstrated profound responses, in some cases re-acquiring previously lost motor milestones.Safety & TolerabilitySafety data from RETRO indicated that SET is generally safe and well-tolerated. Most reported adverse events were considered not related to study drug (199 of 292), with mild or moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event, occurring in 63% of patients.Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 14 subjects (37%). The majority of SAEs were deemed related to TK2d; two patients experienced three events related to study drug alone (kidney stone, kidney stone removal, diarrhea).Two adult-onset patients stopped treatment due to asymptomatic increases in aminotransferase liver enzymes (no increase in bilirubin levels), which resolved upon discontinuation of treatment.08:07WIRES On The WiresAllergan plc (AGN) announced the launch of three new over-the-counter REFRESH RELIEVA products: REFRESH RELIEVA, REFRESH RELIEVA PF (preservative-free) multidose, and REFRESH RELIEVA FOR CONTACTS.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/A.Other news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019, net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 million, from $243.7 million in September a year earlier (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 million or 2.1% versus the same prior year one-month period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUS.Related retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, M.Related agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS.07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019, to be slightly greater than the outlook the Company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired. S&P Futures are off by fifteen points, trading around the 2936 level. This comes after spoos put in a high of 2943.25 and a low of 2928.00.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong were closed. Chinese markets will re-open tomorrow after a week-long hiatus. In Japan, the Nikkei gave back about 0.2%, which is encouraging considering key heavyweights such as Honda and Panasonic closed about 1% lower. In Europe, the major bourses are down but having an uneventful session. Germany posted a weaker than expected Factory Orders figure for August that came in at -0.6%, after the market expected a fall of only 0.3%. This, and the early pressure in the US, has seemingly kept a lid on equity gains throughout the region.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -16.010 yr Note: 1.52%USD/JPY: 106.84 -0.06EUR/USD: 1.0971 -0.0005Europe: FTSE -0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng CLOSED Shanghai CLOSED Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1508.10 -4.80) Silver (17.50 -0.12) Crude (52.99 +0.18)18:02WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ENDP (3.82 +19.75%), ARQL (8.29 +18.43%), SRPT (88.25 +17.67%), CDNA (25.37 +16.22%), RGNX (38.49 +15.41%), ARWR (30.6 +13.5%)Materials: SBGL (6.36 +14.39%)Consumer Discretionary: TSG (20.92 +38.82%)Information Technology: RNG (163.3 +31.85%), AVYA (13.23 +28.45%), OKTA (116.53 +20.06%), COUP (148.32 +15.97%)Energy: TOO (1.53 +30.77%), DHT (6.88 +14.1%), STNG (33.65 +14.07%), FRO (10.28 +12.72%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: GTHX (23.34 -31.29%), LNTH (19.74 -22.04%), ANGO (14.6 -19.02%)Materials: SXC (5.31 -15.71%)Consumer Discretionary: GPRO (3.97 -21%), TAST (6.8 -16.46%)Information Technology: CASA (6.22 -20.47%)Financials: AMTD (33.7 -28.25%), ETFC (36.4 -15.87%)Energy: NBR (1.57 -18.65%), MDR (1.63 -18.5%), QEP (3.15 -17.54%), CDEV (3.8 -15.95%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (7.45 -34.76%), CALM (37.97 -16.4%)18:01NBIX Neurocrine Biosci presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia (89.73 -0.20)The analyses of pooled data from multiple long-term studies of the 40 mg dose showed that 53.7% of patients taking 40 mg of INGREZZA achieved an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) response (= 50% improvement from baseline) after 48 weeks of treatment.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/AOther news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019 metrics; net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 mln, from $243.7 mln in the prior year September period (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 mln, or 2.1%, vs the same prior year one-month September period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired. S&P Futures are off by fifteen points, trading around the 2936 level. This comes after spoos put in a high of 2943.25 and a low of 2928.00.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong were closed. Chinese markets will re-open tomorrow after a week-long hiatus. In Japan, the Nikkei gave back about 0.2%, which is encouraging considering key heavyweights such as Honda and Panasonic closed about 1% lower. In Europe, the major bourses are down but having an uneventful session. Germany posted a weaker than expected Factory Orders figure for August that came in at -0.6%, after the market expected a fall of only 0.3%. This, and the early pressure in the US, has seemingly kept a lid on equity gains throughout the region.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -16.010 yr Note: 1.52%USD/JPY: 106.84 -0.06EUR/USD: 1.0971 -0.0005Europe: FTSE -0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng CLOSED Shanghai CLOSED Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1508.10 -4.80) Silver (17.50 -0.12) Crude (52.99 +0.18)18:02WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ENDP (3.82 +19.75%), ARQL (8.29 +18.43%), SRPT (88.25 +17.67%), CDNA (25.37 +16.22%), RGNX (38.49 +15.41%), ARWR (30.6 +13.5%)Materials: SBGL (6.36 +14.39%)Consumer Discretionary: TSG (20.92 +38.82%)Information Technology: RNG (163.3 +31.85%), AVYA (13.23 +28.45%), OKTA (116.53 +20.06%), COUP (148.32 +15.97%)Energy: TOO (1.53 +30.77%), DHT (6.88 +14.1%), STNG (33.65 +14.07%), FRO (10.28 +12.72%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: GTHX (23.34 -31.29%), LNTH (19.74 -22.04%), ANGO (14.6 -19.02%)Materials: SXC (5.31 -15.71%)Consumer Discretionary: GPRO (3.97 -21%), TAST (6.8 -16.46%)Information Technology: CASA (6.22 -20.47%)Financials: AMTD (33.7 -28.25%), ETFC (36.4 -15.87%)Energy: NBR (1.57 -18.65%), MDR (1.63 -18.5%), QEP (3.15 -17.54%), CDEV (3.8 -15.95%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (7.45 -34.76%), CALM (37.97 -16.4%)18:01NBIX Neurocrine Biosci presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia (89.73 -0.20)The analyses of pooled data from multiple long-term studies of the 40 mg dose showed that 53.7% of patients taking 40 mg of INGREZZA achieved an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) response (= 50% improvement from baseline) after 48 weeks of treatment.

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

A survival analysis using a time-dependent Cox regression model showed that the difference in probability of survival between treated patients and untreated natural history control patients was highly statistically significant (p<0.0006). In addition to the survival benefit, the vast majority of treated patients (94.7%) had either improved (68%) or stabilized (26%) responses in major functional domains. Among clinical responders, a subset demonstrated profound responses, in some cases re-acquiring previously lost motor milestones.Safety & TolerabilitySafety data from RETRO indicated that SET is generally safe and well-tolerated. Most reported adverse events were considered not related to study drug (199 of 292), with mild or moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event, occurring in 63% of patients.Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 14 subjects (37%). The majority of SAEs were deemed related to TK2d; two patients experienced three events related to study drug alone (kidney stone, kidney stone removal, diarrhea).Two adult-onset patients stopped treatment due to asymptomatic increases in aminotransferase liver enzymes (no increase in bilirubin levels), which resolved upon discontinuation of treatment.08:07WIRES On The WiresAllergan plc (AGN) announced the launch of three new over-the-counter REFRESH RELIEVA products: REFRESH RELIEVA, REFRESH RELIEVA PF (preservative-free) multidose, and REFRESH RELIEVA FOR CONTACTS.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved at least a 30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm. The most common adverse events in the aldafermin arm, which were generally mild to moderate, were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and arthralgia (joint pain).08:04SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:N/AOther news:PFNX +13.8% (announces that the FDA has approved the new drug application for PF708, with Forteo as the reference drug, for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture) SPWR +5.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) FSLR +4.9% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) EDIT +2.2% (announce commercial license agreement) GE +1.9% (announces U.S. pension plan actions -- expected to reduce pension deficit by approximately $5-8 bln and net debt by approximately $4-6 bln)NBIX +1.4% (presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia)ENPH +1.3% (positively impacted by removal of tariff exemption for bifacial solar panels) TOT +1.3% (announced that the production from Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup field has started -- more than two months ahead of schedule and with a cost reduced by more than 30%) SCHW +1.1% (positive Barron's article) TSM +0.7% (positive Barron's article)Analyst comments:RNG +5.5% (upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)MTCH +4.2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Nomura; upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank)SDC +3.6% (initiated with an Overweight at JP Morgan, among others)UBER +3.4% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup)AYX +2.5% (upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush)ETFC +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at UBS)08:04SIMO Silicon Motion raises Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance (35.85 )Co issues raises guidance for Q3 (Sep), sees Q3 (Sep) revs of within 5% higher than $108 mln or $108-113.4 mln from $104-108 mln prior guidance vs. $105.10 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin (non-GAAP) is expected to be near the high-end of the company's original guidance range of 48.0% to 50.0%.08:03QRVO Qorvo acquires Cavendish Kinetics; terms not disclosed (74.88 )Cavendish Kinetics is the world's leading provider of high-performance RF MEMS technology for antenna tuning applications.08:02PSMT PriceSmart announces September 2019 metrics; net merchandise sales increased 1.2% to $246.6 mln, from $243.7 mln in the prior year September period (67.70 )Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted net merchandise sales negatively by $5.1 mln, or 2.1%, vs the same prior year one-month September period.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUSRelated retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, MRelated agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019 to be slightly greater than the outlook the company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired.

Data also showed that meaningful long-term reductions in TD were achieved regardless of whether patients responded after two weeks.Neurocrine Biosciences also presented a post-hoc analysis of KINECT 3, the pivotal Phase III study, indicating that both the 40 mg and 80 mg doses of INGREZZA improved TD as early as two weeks in adults with TD, as measured by global clinician and patient scales.17:03ADMA ADMA Biologics files for $200 mln mixed securities shelf offering (4.14 -0.03)16:32ASR Grupo Aeroportuario Del Sureste reports that total passenger traffic for September increased 5.5% yr/yr (155.80 +2.21)Passenger traffic increased 2.0% in Mexico, 8.4% in Puerto Rico, and 12.1% in Colombia.16:23VRCA Verrica Pharmaceuticals CFO Chris Degnan to resign effective on October 18 (14.48 -0.31)Mr. Degnan's resignation did not result from a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices, including its controls or financial related matters. The Company has initiated an active search for a new Chief Financial Officer.16:19WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 rose 1.4% on Friday, with buying momentum picking up after the release of the Employment Situation Report for September and continuing throughout the day. It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

Friday's Sports in BriefAssociated Press InternationalOctober 19, 2019 Saturday 6:32 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS NEWS; Sports BriefsLength: 881 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyPRO BASKETBALLBEIJING (AP) - China denied NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's claim that it demanded the firing of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey over a tweet that supported anti-government protests in Hong Kong."The Chinese government never posed this requirement," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.During an appearance in New York on Thursday, Silver said the NBA was "being asked to fire (Morey) by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business.""We said, 'There's no chance that's happening,'" Silver said. "There's no chance we'll even discipline him."Chinese state broadcaster CCTV did not air the two NBA preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets last week. Tencent, which has a $1.5 billion deal to stream NBA games in China over the next five years, has also stopped showing Rockets games but has not totally dropped all NBA content.The league and LeBron James, one of its biggest stars, have been heavily criticized by some U.S. lawmakers for the perception that they caved to the Chinese regime. Morey has not been rebuked publicly by the league, and Silver has said that the league will support his freedom of expression.NEW YORK (AP) - A group of fans held signs, wore shirts and chanted support for Hong Kong and Tibet in the Brooklyn Nets' first game since returning from China.The fans sat behind the backboard near the Nets' bench at Barclays Center in their 123-107 loss to Toronto on Friday night.The Nets returned this week after playing exhibition games against the Los Angeles Lakers in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The games were not televised in China after relations between the NBA and Chinese officials became strained following Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.One sign was aimed at LeBron James and Nets owner Joe Tsai, the co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, who were critical of Morey's tweet. Tsai wrote a Facebook post explaining why the since-deleted tweet was upsetting to the Chinese.PRO FOOTBALLKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes escaped significant ligament damage when he dislocated his right kneecap, and there is optimism the reigning NFL MVP could be back on the field in about a month.Mahomes had an MRI exam that showed the ligaments were intact, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team was still sorting through the results and putting together a timetable for his return.The Chiefs play Green Bay a week from Sunday, then face the Vikings and Titans before a Monday night matchup against Tennessee on Nov. 18. The Chiefs (5-2) have their bye the following week, so it is possible they hold Mahomes out until Dec. 1 against Oakland.Mahomes was hurt in a 30-6 victory in Denver on Thursday night while sneaking for first down on fourth-and-short deep in Broncos territory.FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) - New York Jets guard Kelechi Osemele says he needs season-ending shoulder surgery and is waiting for the team to authorize the procedure, but the team wants him on the field.Osemele said the team doctor and an outside doctor have both recommended the surgery. But a person with direct knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press both doctors determined it is actually a pre-existing injury and cleared Osemele to play through it.Osemele is expected to practice Saturday or face a fine and/or suspension for conduct detrimental to the team, according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team has not publicly commented on the situation.The Jets acquired Osemele from Oakland in March. He says he was initially hurt in August and re-injured his shoulder at New England on Sept. 22.GOLFJEJU ISLAND, South Korea (AP) - Top-ranked Brooks Koepka withdrew from the PGA Tour's CJ Cup before the third round after aggravating a left knee injury a day earlier when he slipped on wet concrete.Playing his second event since stem cell treatment on the knee Aug. 25, Koepka shot a 3-over 75 on Friday at Nine Bridges after opening with a 69. The defending champion was 13 strokes behind leader Justin Thomas in the limited-field event with no cut.Koepka returned to Florida to meet with his doctors, leaving his status for the HSBC Champions in two weeks in China uncertain. He missed the cut two weeks ago in his season debut at Las Vegas.The American won three PGA Tour titles last season. He has four major titles, also winning the PGA in 2018 and the U.S. Open in 2017 and 2018.HORSE RACINGARCADIA, Calif. (AP) - Hall of Fame trainer Jerry Hollendorfer is banned from entering horses in the Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita, where he was barred earlier this year.Fred Hertrich, chairman of the Breeders' Cup board, said it would honor Santa Anita's house rule and not allow Hollendorfer to enter horses in the event Nov. 1-2.The Stronach Group, whose track ownership includes Santa Anita and Golden Gate Fields in the San Francisco Bay area, ordered Hollendorfer off the grounds after six horses - four at Santa Anita and two at Golden Gate - died under his care earlier this year. Santa Anita had 30 horses die during its winter-spring meet.Load-Date: October 20, 2019End of Document

Hong Kong descended into chaos. In flag-covered Beijing, almost no one noticedCNN.comOctober 1, 2019 Tuesday 9:50 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 665 wordsByline: Analysis by Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: Beijing BodyIn the tightly-censored bubble of state-run media and restricted internet, Beijing locals enjoyed their October 1 National Day seemingly unaware that in Hong Kong, which is Chinese territory, police and protesters were fighting in the streets.People did take to Beijing's streets later in the evening -- but it was only to get a better view of the massive fireworks display over Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, part of the celebrations to mark 70 years of the People's Republic of China.It was a stark contrast that made headlines around the world -- the order and pomp of Beijing versus the rage of Hong Kong's demonstrators, with one protester even shot by police in a confrontation. It was the first time lethal force had been used in 17 weeks of demonstrations.Of course, inside China it is immensely difficult to truly gauge how much people know about events, and what their true feelings are. Saying the wrong thing can quickly get you in trouble with authorities.But on televisions and phones across Beijing, between shots of tanks and dancers, President Xi Jinping's beaming face was the most common sight. The Chinese government had ratcheted up censorship ahead of the 70th anniversary -- for Xi, nothing could be allowed to go wrong.In Beijing on October 1, rather than screen footage of the scenes in Hong Kong, state-run media played shows and panel discussions praising the achievements of the Chinese government, or replayed footage of the morning's military parade. When CNN broadcast news of the protests inside the country, screens went black as censors cut off the feed.Patriotism and prideOn the country's social media sites, such as the Twitter-like Weibo, messages were full of patriotism and pride. Commentary around the morning's military parade was either blandly positive or strictly apolitical.All comments on Hong Kong were heavily filtered to give the impression of a city celebrating the 70th anniversary along with the rest of the country. The top five trending terms about the city on Tuesday were stories of patriotic Hong Kongers unfurling the Chinese flag on the iconic Lion Rock mountain, or groups gathering in the streets to celebrate the anniversary.To an outside observer, the propaganda and censorship might seem like only a means to an end, a way to ensure that the parade went as smoothly as possible and the image of China as a united and powerful country was maintained for the outside world. But that ignores the political significance of the parade itself. For President Xi and the Chinese government, the majesty of the march through Beijing on Tuesday was aimed squarely at the country's almost 1.4 billion people.The viewing figures alone are staggering. An estimated 1.2 billion people watched the state-run CCTV coverage, according to the government, a figure almost equal to the entire population.The message was one of the stability and might: you are part of a powerful nation which is just beginning to set foot on the world stage. China has changed a lot in the past 70 years and many people are proud of their country's achievements -- and with good reason. In just a matter of decades, their nation has gone from an impoverished backwater to one of the wealthiest in the world.Domestic touches that would mean nothing to international observers were designed to pull in as many Chinese individuals as possible. Each province was represented by a lavish float, which drove down the center of Beijing's Chang'an avenue.At night, each of China's official 56 minority groups was represented in the gala performance, taking turns to dance, faces full of happy smiles.On the ground, it's impossible to tell how much of an effect the blatantly positive messaging has. Hong Kang, 23, an advertising worker from the eastern city of Hangzhou, said the unrest in Hong Kong was "useless."When told someone had been shot on Tuesday, he wasn't surprised. "There won't be any good outcome for you if you fight with the great China," he added.Load-Date: October 3, 2019End of Document

Trump proposed doubling tariffs on China after retaliation, CNBC reportsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 4, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 274 wordsBodyDonald J. Trump, the US president, came close to doubling the 25% tariffs he had imposed on Chinese imports, following mirror measures announced by Beijing late last month, US television network CNBC reported, with sources close to the matter.His cabinet officials convinced him not to act on that proportion, and in the end, the president agreed to raise tariff rates against $550 billion by five percentage points to 30 percent.Trump's backlash came after The Xi Jinping administration decided to put tariffs against 75 billion goods originating in the United States, as part of the trade war that both nations held out last year.CNBC reported that Steven Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer, the Treasury secretary and the White House trade representative, respectively, managed to get many Directors of U.S. companies to warn the president of the serious impact he would have on the U.S. economy putting 50% tariffs on Chinese goods.The US president said yesterday that the negotiation with Beijing is going very well, but warned the Chinese government not to try to delay negotiations for a trade agreement."We are doing very well in our negotiation with China. Although I'm sure they'd love to have to deal with a new administration so they can continue their practice of tearing america apart ($600 billion a year). 16 more months is a long time to have hemorrhages in jobs and businesses in the long run," the representative wrote on his personal Twitter account. "And think about what happens to China when it wins. The deal will be much tougher. Meanwhile, the Chinese supply chain is crumbling and businesses, jobs and currencies will go away."Load-Date: September 5, 2019End of Document

The china-NBA conflict over the rockets manager's support for Hong KongCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 7, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 613 wordsBody"Fight for freedom, support Hong Kong," was the message of Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, who has turned upside down diplomatic relations between China and the NBA and the Texan team. Today, the Asian country is one of the most recognized partners in the best basketball league in the world in terms of business.Morey's controversial words have provoked China's veto to the Rockets, who played their first pre-season matches in Shanghai a few days ago. So the Asian giant has decided to break the negotiations by stopping broadcasting its matches: they will suspend all reports and streaming the franchise, so the Chinese market for Texans is in serious danger.Apart from Tencent, the streaming platform that in the summer renewed its NBA rights with a new $1.5 billion five-year contract, other Chinese brands that had agreements with the Rockets have decided to suspend their agreements, such as Li Ning, Shanghai Pudong, Development Bank and Nasdaq Jianyin Group, Chinese media announced.The Chinese Basketball Federation (CBA), whose president is Yao Ming, has also expressed its rejection of Morey's support for Hong Kong protesters. Yao Ming, a former Rockets player and the franchise's large media boom manager in the country, announced that he would suspend cooperation with the team on the grounds that Morey had made "inappropriate comments regarding Hong Kong" to which he expressed his "strong opposition."And in all this mess is also the NBA. The U.S. league has expressed its displeasure with the rockets' tweet criticizing the comment for "deeply offending many friends and fans in China, which is unfortunate." A Chinese version of the statement, published on Weibo (the national equivalent of Twitter), went further, stating that the NBA was "deeply disappointed by the inappropriate statements" of the Rockets' leader.All of this comes at an important time for the NBA's economic and political interests in China. In a few days, two of the most powerful teams in the competition will arrive in Chinese territory, such as the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets. Nets owner Canadian-Taiwan millionaire Joseph Tsai, co-founder of Alibabá, explained why the message was intolerable to the Beijing government and Chinese citizens.Politically, the NBA has also been criticized by Democratic party political figures for putting economic benefits to human rights first or yielding for interests to authoritarian government. The image of the world's best basketball league would be in a moment before its commissioner, Adam Silver, travels to China and Japan to pursue a policy of expansion into those markets.Apologies from Morey, Rockets and playersThe Rockets executive also issued a statement in an effort to alleviate backlash, writing on Twitter that he had no intention of offending fans in China. "I was simply expressing a thought, based on an interpretation, of a complicated event. Since that tweet I've had many opportunities to listen and consider other perspectives."Previously, rockets owner Tilman Fertitta had issued a statement that he completely rejected Morey's tweet and reiterated that the Houston team was no political organization, although he said that on a professional level he had no problem with which he considered "the best general manager in the league."The players of the Texan team have also stepped in to show their forgiveness to the initial tweet of their general manager. "We apologize. We love China. WeHe likes to play there," said Rockets star James Harden, accompanied by the team's other benchmark, Russell Westbrook, during a press conference in Tokyo, where he will play two friendly games this week.Load-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

China criticizes US tech curbs but trade talks going aheadAssociated Press Financial WireOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 11:00 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 535 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China demanded Washington lift newly imposed sanctions on Chinese tech companies but said Tuesday envoys will go ahead with a U.S. trip for trade talks despite the latest spike in tensions.The foreign ministry criticized the curbs on sales of U.S. technology to the Chinese companies as interference in China's affairs but gave no indication whether Beijing might retaliate. The measure announced Monday targets providers of technology Washington says is being used to repress Muslim ethnic minorities."We urge the United States to immediately correct its wrong practices, withdraw the relevant decisions and stop interfering in China's internal affairs," said the spokesman, Geng Shuang. "China will continue to take firm and strong measures to resolutely safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests."The curbs are an added strain for U.S.-Chinese relations and have stoked alarm about the possible impact on the global economy at a time when growth is weakening.They target Chinese companies that develop facial recognition and other artificial intelligence technology U.S. officials say is being used to repress Muslims in China's northwest.Vendors are barred from selling U.S. technology to the Chinese companies without government permission. They include Hikvision and Dahua, both of which are global providers of video surveillance technology.Prominent AI firms such as Sense Time, Megvii and iFlytek are also on the Commerce Department's Entity List. Sense Time and Megvii are known for computer vision technology that underpins facial recognition products, while iFlytek is known for its voice recognition and translation services.Megvii said Tuesday there are "no grounds" for including the company in the blacklist. Megvii said it received no revenue from projects in Xinjiang in the six months through June 30."We believe our inclusion on the list reflects a misunderstanding of our company," said a Megvii statement.Hikvision said Monday it respects human rights and opposes the Trump administration's decision.Similar sanctions were imposed earlier on Huawei Technologies Ltd., a maker of smartphones and network switching equipment that is China's first global tech brand.Despite the Chinese criticism, the Ministry of Commerce said Vice Premier Liu He will go to Washington for talks Thursday. His delegation will include China's commerce minister and central bank governor and industry, technology and agriculture regulators.The two governments have made conciliatory gestures ahead of the talks including lifting or postponing punitive tariffs. But there has been no sign of progress toward settling their core disputes over China's trade surplus and technology ambitions.Beijing is resisting U.S. pressure to roll back plans for government-led development of global competitors in robotics and other technologies.Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate China's market-opening commitments. Some American officials worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.The two sides have raised import duties on billions of dollars of each other's goods, fueling fears their dispute might tip the global economy into recession.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 25 of 898Trade war: Imports of U.S. products into China fell 22% in August compared to previous year  Page 58 of 898Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 14:00 ET  Page 93 of 898Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 15:00 ET  Page 95 of 898HONG KONG-BORN AUSTRALIAN LAWMAKER FACES PROBE INTO LINKS TO CHINESE COMMUNIST-BACKED GROUPS  Page 97 of 898Watch The Episode That Got 'South Park' Banned In China  Page 99 of 898China-U.S. tension dribbles into to the sports world  Page  of Goldman Sachs to Review Role in IPO of Blacklisted Chinese AI Firm Megvii  Page 102 of 898Stocks Drop as US Puts Restrictions on Chinese Entities, Officials Over Treatment of Muslim Minorities  Page 104 of 898China criticizes Apple for app that tracks Hong Kong police  Page 107 of 898US blacklists 28 Chinese organizations and companies over Xinjiang camps  Page 109 of 898New DRONERESPONDERS Report Examines Foreign Dominance of U.S. Public Safety Drone Sector; Research explores landscape and perspectives surrounding use of Chines....  Page 111 of 898Apple's Tim Cook is now top adviser to the business school at 'China's Harvard'  Page 113 of 898San Francisco tour guide charged with carrying USA secrets to China  Page 116 of 898Zara the Latest Brand Attacked as China's Tactics Turn to 'White Terror'  Page 125 of 898Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 07:00 ET  Page 127 of 898Trump has the upper hand in the trade war with China.
