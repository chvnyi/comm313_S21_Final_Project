Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 14:00 ETBriefing.comNovember 26, 2019 Tuesday 2:05 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc. All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 19292 wordsBodyHourly In Play (R)Updated: 26-Nov-19 14:00 ET13:53ADSK Autodesk: Earnings Preview; Recent run in the stock makes us a bit nervous heading into this report (170.51 +1.63)Autodesk (ADSK), which offers 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software primarily for architects and engineers, is set to report Q3 (Oct) results today after the close with a call to follow at 5pm ET. Last quarter, ADSK reported at 16:01, or one minute after the close, so it may be right after the close.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS is $0.72. The revenue consensus estimate is $824 mln. On August 27, ADSK guided to non-GAAP EPS of $0.70-0.74 and revenue of $820-830 mln. Full year guidance was: non-GAAP EPS of $2.69-2.81 and revenue growth pf +26-27%, which we compute as $3.24-3.15 bln. Note: ADSK typically guides for revenue and EPS in the press release for the next quarter and full year.It's important to note that the company views ARR (annualized recurring revenue) as the best proxy for measuring its progress and the overall health of the business. So that will be a metric to watch. Its current FY20 guidance is for ARR of $3.425-3.385 bln. ADSK does not guide for ARR on a quarterly basis. However, last quarter, it reported ARR of $3.07 bln. Non-GAAP operating margin is another metric to watch, Q2 came in at 23%.Of note, ADSK has been transitioning its business away from maintenance revenue and toward recurring revenue for its core design platforms. With less than 20% of revenue coming from maintenance, ADSK says it's effectively finished with its business model transition. Another big push ADSK has been making is to boost its construction offerings as it has made a number of recent acquisitions in this area.The headline last quarter was that ADSK rebounded from its first EPS miss in five years in AprQ to report nice upside in JulQ. However, ADSK also lowered full-year guidance for both EPS and revenue despite reporting upside in JulQ. ADSK said it does not expect to be materially impacted by current trade tensions and macro uncertainty, but it wanted to take a prudent stance to its second half FY20 guidance.ADSK has had a halo effect on its stock in recent years, but its last two earnings reports have tarnished that image to some degree. Nevertheless, investors seem to be brushing off concerns about the guidance as they have bid the stock up more than 20% since mid-October. This makes us a bit nervous heading into this report as investors may be too optimistic.13:49COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $4.40 (0.3%) at $1461.4/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.16 higher (0.98%) at $17.05/oz Dec copper settled $0.03 higher (1.13%) at $2.675/lb13:19OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AAOI Dec 10.5 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 4% (volume: 4670, open int: 10, implied vol: ~76%, prev day implied vol: 58%).

The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (27.74 mln -2.98%), CCXI (22.28 mln +266.25%), PFE (13.84 mln -0.48%), MDCO (12.32 mln +0.1%)Materials: VALE (14 mln -0.25%), FCX (12.4 mln +0.13%)Industrials: GE (29.8 mln -0.65%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (31.14 mln +7.07%), DLTR (14.6 mln -16.36%), DKS (12.46 mln +19.2%)Information Technology: FIT (41.95 mln +3.61%), AMD (26.78 mln -1.91%), NOK (14.95 mln -1.3%), HPE (14.07 mln -8.68%), NTNX (12.69 mln +16.73%)Financials: BAC (20.07 mln -0.67%), ITUB (18.37 mln -3.84%)Energy: CHK (60.44 mln +2.69%), SWN (18 mln -4.36%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: CCXI (39.14x +266.25%), GBT (5.85x +4.8%), CBAY (5.48x +10.53%), MDCO (3.26x +0.1%), EDIT (2.48x +3.9%)Industrials: BECN (3.47x -10.46%)Consumer Discretionary: DLTR (9.98x -16.36%), DKS (6.98x +19.2%), MOV (5.43x -21.59%), BBY (3.85x +11.52%), CHS (2.59x +15.19%), ANF (2.56x -3%), BURL (2.53x +9.09%)Information Technology: NTNX (4.94x +16.73%), PANW (4.8x -12.03%), AMBA (2.75x -4.86%)Financials: MUFG (7.69x -0.65%), WBK (2.63x -1.32%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: CCXI (29.52 +266.25%), ARWR (66.89 +17.37%), AUPH (7 +13%), CLVS (11.4 +10.98%), CBAY (1.47 +10.53%), ABEO (3.15 +9.76%), YMAB (32.12 +8.66%), SENS (1.04 +7.37%)Industrials: DY (54.58 +9.27%)Consumer Discretionary: DKS (47 +19.2%), CHS (4.82 +15.19%), BBY (82.8 +11.52%), BURL (227.19 +9.09%), EXPR (3.95 +7.63%), NIO (2.2 +7.07%), DESP (12.5 +6.38%), WTRH (0.4 +6.33%)Information Technology: NTNX (33.56 +16.73%), GTT (5.96 +8.8%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.12 -7.57%), XON (5.67 -6.28%), ACOR (1.79 -6.05%)Industrials: BECN (29.88 -10.46%), AZUL (35.4 -7.5%), GOL (15.36 -6.28%)Consumer Discretionary: MOV (19.76 -21.59%), DLTR (94.01 -16.36%)Information Technology: PANW (220.16 -12.03%), HPE (15.94 -8.68%), PAGS (30.88 -8.26%)Energy: MDR (0.72 -10.59%), RRC (3.51 -9.66%), WLL (4.99 -8.1%), EXTN (5.79 -7.95%), TGS (5.74 -6.29%), SDRL (1.1 -5.98%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.1 -7.3%), XXII (0.95 -7.03%)12:40DIS Walt Disney advances 2.5% to new all-time highs after Consumer Edge Research initiates coverage on shares with an Overweight rating and the NY Post reports that the company is adding roughly 1 mln new subscribers to Disney+ each day (153.25 +3.56)12:37XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (38.54 +0.39)The New Home Sales report for October was better than expected and reflected the impressive rebound in new home sales that has been unfolding this year. To wit, new home sales were up 31.6% yr/yr with double-digit percentage increases across all regions.Hearing this, it likely won't be a surprise to hear that the S&P 500 real estate sector (+1.1%) is today's best-performing sector. The only thing is, new home sales have nothing to do directly with this sector, which is populated with office REITs, retail REITs, storage REITs, specialty REITs, and residential REITs focused on rental apartment properties.Why, then, is this sector outperforming? Key factors include:The continued drop in interest rates, which increase the appeal of a sector that provides handsome dividend yields. The 10-yr note yield is 1.73% while the sector's dividend yield is 3.31%.Sector rotation into an area of the market that has trailed the broader market's breakout to a record high. This sector has declined 1.2% over the last three months versus a 9.1% gain for the S&P 500. Some see added "catch-up potential" here in a possible year-end rally effort for the broader market.With improving economic sentiment and the persistence of low interest rates, stocks in this sector are standing out for total return potential at a time when forecasts for 2020 are primarily calling for a modest gain for the S&P 500 in 2020.Notable movers:Iron Mountain (IRM 32.54, -1.51, -4.4%): one of the few losers in the group today after the storage and information management services company announced its CFO, Stuart Brown, will be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests.

Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI), has been named as his successor; IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.CBRE Group (CBRE 57.71, +1.59, +2.8%): no news, but stock has broken out to a new all-time high today, albeit on light volumeSBA Communications (SBAC 236.78, +5.24, +2.3%): no news as stock rises to challenge its 50-day moving average (239.54)American Tower (AMT 213.46, +3.74, +1.8%): no news, but drawing support after flirting with test of 200-day moving average (207.03) on Monday12:05ARWR Arrowhead sees extension of recent run to multi-year highs as shares jump 16% today in response to last night's full year financial results; shares now up 432% YTD (66.02 +9.03)As covered last night, the company reported FY19 EPS of $0.69 vs $0.73 S&P Capital IQ Consensus Estimate; revs were +946% to $168.8 mln vs $166.91 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Highlights from last night's conference call (Prepared remarks):"There are now 5 TRiMTM-enabled candidates in the clinic, 3 of which are whollyowned and 2 are partnered. Over the next month we plan to submit regulatory filings for 2 additional clinical candidates, and by the end of 2020, we intend to have 10 TRiM -enabled candidates in clinical studies targeting four different cell types. Further, we expect to be in 3 pivotal studies by the end of 2020.""We feel confident about our ability to achieve these aggressive targets, and we have good reason to believe in the ultimate success of these clinical programs for a number of reasons.""The RNAi field is just beginning what we believe to be a golden age. This modality is increasingly accepted as a reliable and powerful way to treat a variety of diseases after two decades of intensive study and development. While the potential and value of direct conjugation delivery in unlocking the potential of RNAi was clear to us by 2016, broader confidence took longer. Interestingly, the increasing validation of RNAi is growing amid a backdrop of scarcity related to companies capable of leveraging it therapeutically and near absolute scarcity of bringing RNAi outside the liver: we think we are probably years ahead of anyone else in this regard."Shares were also up 16% yesterday after Robert W. Baird upgraded the stock to Outperform in response to Novartis's (NVS) $9.7 bln buyout of Arrowhead RNAi peer Medicines Company (MDCO).11:31HPQ HP Q4 Earnings Preview (19.92 -0.23)HP is scheduled to report Q4 results tonight after the bell with a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET.As it stands, the Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q4 EPS of $0.58 (vs $0.54 a year ago) on essentially flat revenues of $15.29 bln.Q4 EPS guidance stands at $0.55-0.59.On October 3, HP provided details on its strategy and opportunities for long-term growth, along with its financial outlook for fiscal 2020. The company's plans followed weak results out of its printing segment in Q3 as well as an attempt to become a more digital-focused company.For fiscal 2020, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $2.22-2.32. Also, HP anticipates generating FCF of at least $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020. The company announced a fiscal year 2020 restructuring plan wherein it would reduce its gross global headcount by ~7-9K employees through a combination of employee exits and voluntary early retirement. The company estimates that it will incur total labor and non-labor costs of approximately $1.0 billion in connection with the restructuring and other charges, with approximately $100 million in fiscal Q4 of 2019, $500 million in fiscal 2020 and the rest split between fiscal 2021 and 2022. These actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2022. The company estimates that these actions will result in annualized gross run rate savings of about $1.0 billion by the end of fiscal 2022.Board also authorized an additional $5.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.Also increased quarterly dividend 10% to $0.1762 from $0.16/share.In August the company announced Enrique Lores will succeed Dion Weisler as CEO, effective November 1.Recent rhetoric in HPQ has surrounded a takeover attempt by Xerox (XRX). In what has become a back-and-forth battle of "we're right" -- "no, we're right," the latest rumblings are that XRX sent a letter to HPQ management basically saying that to not engage in talks would defy logic. Given the lack of communication between the two parties, XRX has expressed interest in rallying shareholder support for a deal with HPQ in lieu of agreeing on a deal with HPQ management directly. At last check HPQ has rejected a proposal from XRX for a reported $22/share.The aforementioned "talks" with XRX have pushed the stock to three-month highs into the print as the stock has recently reclaimed the 200-day SMA (19.55).We'd also point out that XRX counts activist giant Carl Icahn as a large investor. As of his latest 13F filing (Nov. 14) Icahn held nearly 23.5 million shares of XRX.All indications are, though, that HPQ will likely not comment on these latest developments in the XRX battle during this quarter's conference call. The likely outcome of these -- what have become hostile -- takeover talks is that HPQ will reiterate its stance that it prefers to be an independent company.Ahead of tonight's print HPQ garners a $29.5 billion market capitalization and trades at about 9.1x forward earnings expectations vs peers Dell's (DELL) 7.8x, and Xerox's (XRX) 9.8x multiples.11:24TALKX Market Briefing: More of the sameThe major indices are sporting modest gains in another resilient showing that has kept broader selling efforts in check.

The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care. BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of avacopan subjects vs 70.1% of control group subjects. Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of avacopan subjects vs 54.9% in the control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care. Acavopan subjects also reportedly experienced further additional benefits vs control, including reduction in glucocorticoid-related toxicity and improvement in kidney function and health-related quality of life metrics. Safety results revealed an "acceptable" safety profile. Together with its partner, VFMCRP, co intends to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to the EMA and the FDA in 2020.

The comp sales decline was driven by lower average dollar sale, partially offset by an increase in transaction count. Updated its FY guidance to "reflect improvements in the business and tariff impact."Small Cap LosersMOV (19.35 -23.21%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (fell 1.6% yr/yr to $205.62 mln). Co commented that while its strategic increase of marketing investment expenditures across its watch brands portfolio led to market share gains, co fell short of its sales plans due to category underperformance "as challenges intensified within the watch category and retail landscape." Lowered FY20 guidance below estimates, now seeing EPS of $1.55-1.70 (prior $2.25-2.35) and revs of $690-700 mln (prior $725-740 mln). Drops to circa three-month lows. TITN (14.95 -17.08%): Reported downside Q3 earnings and revs (flat yr/yr at $360.9 mln). Among category results, equipment sales declined yr/yr to $246.0 mln vs $253.8 mln in the prior year quarter; parts sales increased yr/yr to $70.8 mln vs $64.6 mln. Citing a higher effective consolidated tax rate and continued market driven challenges within the International segment, co lowered guidance for FY20 EPS at the mid-point, below consensus, and decreased its International segment revenue growth forecast. Co is including expected contributions from the recently-acquired Northwood dealership in its modeling assumptions for the balance of the year.

The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

R&D, a Danish company founded in 2005, is a recognized leader in the design and manufacture of test systems that accurately simulate the extreme operating environments often encountered by large, rotating structures, such as wind turbines, and aircraft engine propulsion systems. R&D significantly expands MTS Test & Simulation's technology base and market presence for wind energy and aerospace markets globally; it provides compelling financial profile to enhance MTS revenue growth, margins, earnings, and free cash generation. The acquisition is expected to close by December 31, 2019.R&D is expected to contribute over $40 mln in incremental revenues in fiscal 2020 and to be accretive to Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Test & Simulation segment. R&D is further expected to be neutral to earnings in year one, exclusive of transaction costs. The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

ADVANCE evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjunctive pimavanserin treatment in patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia who have achieved adequate control of positive symptoms with their existing antipsychotic treatment. No drug is approved by the FDA for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.Pimavanserin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement on the study's primary endpoint, the change from baseline to week 26 on the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 (NSA-16) total score, compared to placebo (-10.4 vs. -8.5; p=0.043; effect size = 0.21). A greater improvement in the NSA-16 total score compared to placebo was observed in the 53.8% of patients (n=107) who received the highest pimavanserin dose of 34 mg (-11.6 vs. -8.5; unadjusted p=0.0065, effect size = 0.34). In this study, pimavanserin did not separate from placebo on the key secondary endpoint, the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale.ACADIA plans to commence a second pivotal study with the 34 mg dose of pimavanserin in the first half of 2020. Additional results from the ADVANCE study will be presented at future scientific meetings.16:03GBT Global Blood Therapeutics confirms FDA accelerated approval for Oxbryta tablets for the treatment of sickle cell disease; expected to be available through GBT's specialty pharmacy partner network within two weeks (59.95 +3.81)As a condition of accelerated approval, GBT will continue to study Oxbryta in the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, a post-approval confirmatory study using transcranial doppler (TCD) flow velocity to demonstrate a decrease in stroke risk in children 2 to 15 years of age.

There is a conference call scheduled for 10:00 ET. Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.14 (-7% yr/yr) on revenue (equipment sales) of $8.41 bln (roughly unchanged yr/yr). FY19 guidance calls for net income of $3.2 bln and revenue growth of +4% in equipment sales and +5% in net sales. FY20 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $11.13 (versus $9.92 estimate in FY19 or +5.6% yr/yr) on revenue of $35.5 bln (vs $34.6 bln estimate in 2019 or +3.8% yr/yr). Looking back, the company missed on EPS four out the last four quarters and missed on revenues two out of the last four quarters. DE shares rose 4% following its Q3 report despite a miss on EPS and lowered FY19 guidance. The Q3 report was consistent with DE's recent history, as it came into this quarter having missed EPS for five consecutive quarters. The Agriculture & Turf segment was the weak link this quarter, as segment sales declined 6% yr/yr to $5.95 bln due to lower shipment volumes and unfavorable FX. Segment operating margin declined quite a bit to 10.3% from 12.8% last year due to inefficiencies from lower shipments coupled with higher production costs.It is clear that the tariffs are hurting Deere on two fronts: It's not just that sales of equipment into those regions that are getting impacted (especially China), but it's also that US farmers getting hurt by China are not buying soybeans and other crops. It's understandable that US farmers are holding off on buying new ag equipment, as nobody knows how long this dispute is going to last.DE has a $55.5 bln valuation and trades at 16 2021 EPS vs CAT which trades at 13 times 2021 EPS.Based on the DE Weekly Nov29 $176 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $180-181 area, while support sits near the $165-166 vicinity.14:34SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: ADSK BOX CENT DELL GES HPQ KEYS QADA VEEV VMWTomorrow Morning: DAKT DE DOYU FRO UXIN14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesJan Crude Oil futures rose $0.23 (0.4%) to $58.3/barrel Jan Natural Gas $0.06 lower (-2.28%) at $2.529/MMBtu Jan RBOB Gasoline settled $0.02 higher (1.34%) at $1.6932/gallon Jan Heating oil futures settled $0.01 higher (0.54%) at $1.954/gallon14:25VMW VMware: Earnings Preview -- Has been on recent M&A shopping spree (166.07 -2.81)VMware (VMW), which specializes in cloud computing and virtualization software, is set to report Q3 (Oct) results today after the close (last time they reported at 16:15 ET, 15 minutes after the close) with a call to follow at 4:30pm ET.The CapitalIQ consensus for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS is $1.43 and for revenue it's $2.41 bln. Note: VMW typically guides on the call for EPS and revs for the next quarter and full year. It also guides for license revenue and non-GAAP operating margin. Last time, it guided for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS of approx $1.42 and revenue of approx $2.40 bln. It also guided to Q3 license revenue of approx $950 mln and non-GAAP operating margin of 30.3%. Of course, the highlight last quarter was VMware announcing it will acquire Pivotal Software (PVTL) and Carbon Black (CBLK). (PVTL should close by Jan 31 while CBLK closed on Oct 8.) In addition, VMW reported earnings, including a $0.05 beat and revenue upside. However, its Q3 (Oct) guidance was below consensus. So it was sort of a mixed result overall. But clearly the focus was on these two purchases. PVTL provides software development tools so that developers can create new cloud-native applications more quickly and easily. VMW already owned a stake in PVTL, so a combination made a lot of sense. Carbon Black was sort of a different animal as it focuses on cybersecurity but VMW sees it as complementary to existing VMW cybersecurity platforms. We will be looking for any updates there. The big picture here is that VMW is really pushing into the cloud. The company started out with server virtualization. However, over the last 5-10 years, VMW has expanded to a number of adjacent areas: management, software-defined networking, storage and end-user computing. Each of these businesses now are in the $1 bln range. These deals continue VMW's transformation. Finally, VMW typically reports EPS upside in the $0.04-0.10 range over the past five quarters. It also generally reports revenue upside, but the top line beat is usually more modest. The stock sold off following its JulQ report in late August, but it has recovered nicely since then, up more than 25%. Much of this move is probably from overall strength in tech stocks, but it also tells us investors are pretty optimistic about its OctQ report.14:17SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) gains following upbeat third quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersDKS (46.73 +18.51%): Posts its highest levels in more than two years after posting upside Q3 results; co topped consensus for both EPS and revs (+5.6% yr/yr to $1.96 bln). Consolidated same store sales surpassed estimates, increasing +6.0%, co's strongest comp gain since 2013, while eCommerce sales increased +13%, forming approx. 13% of total net sales. Co reported that it saw increases in both average ticket and transactions and that it recorded growth across its three primary product categories. Guided FY20 EPS above consensus. Forecasts a +2.5-3% comp sales increase for the full year. ARWR (66.82 +17.25%): Again advances to fresh multi-year highs after reporting FY19 financial results and other company updates; revs jumped +946% yr/yr to $168.8 mln. Co noted in its prepared remarks, among other updates, that there are now five TRiM-enabled candidates in the clinic; co plans to submit regulatory filings for two additional clinical candidates over the next month and intends to have 10 TRiM-enabled candidates in clinical studies targeting four different cell types and to be in three pivotal studies by the end of 2020. NTNX (33.15 +15.29%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revenue. Billings declined yr/yr to $380.0 mln from $383.6 mln in the prior year quarter, reflecting billings compression from co's ongoing transition to a subscription model and a significant reduction in hardware billings yr/yr. Software and Support TCV revs increased +9% yr/yr to $305.0 mln on a +5% Software and Support TCV billings increase to $370.3 mln. Issued in-line Q2 EPS and FY20 revs guidance while guiding Q2 revs below consensus. Co sees Software and Support TCV billings between $1.65-1.75 bln for FY20. Price target raised at various firms, including Maxim Group (to $52 from $48). At six-month highs.Mid Cap LosersBECN (29.3 -12.2%): Missed consensus for Q4 EPS and revs (+4.9% yr/yr to $2.03 bln). Sales increased yr/yr for consolidated residential roofing (+12.7%) and non-residential roofing (+2.4%) products but decreased for consolidated complementary products (fell 3.2%). Results were negatively impacted by lower gross margins and higher acquisition-related costs relative to 2018; meanwhile, existing market sales growth in residential roofing had a positive impact. Co management commented that co is "now pivoting from a growth run via acquisitions" to focus on organic growth, margin expansion, and operating expense discipline. Also announced that CFO Joseph Nowicki will depart co later this year in order to focus on his family, charitable work, and Board service; he will remain during co's search for his successor. At three-month lows. KRTX (74.79 -8.99%): Continued volatility. In recent press, co announced that it will present and host investor meetings at the Piper Jaffray 31st Annual Healthcare Conference on Thursday of next week, December 5. AZUL (35.7 -6.72%): Brazilian stocks lag relatively amid volatility in the Brazilian real, Reuters reports that weakness in the currency followed comments made in the U.S. on Monday by the country's Economy Minister, Paulo Guedes, which included his indication that he is not worried about the currency's exchange rate fluctuations or the country's deficit; the country's central bank reportedly intervened in the foreign exchange market today to ease pressure on the real.

There are two primary catalysts:The October New Home Sales report was better than expected, with sales checking in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units. That was up 31.6% from a year-ago. October also marked the third straight month that new home sales exceeded 700,000, which is something that hasn't happened since 2007.Interest rates continue to creep lower, which bodes well for mortgage rates and prospective buyer demand. The 10-yr note yield is down two basis points to 1.74% today and down 20 basis points from where it stood on November 11.Using the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) as a proxy, the homebuilding industry has been a relative strength leader all year. Including today's gain the ITB is up 40.7% in 2019 versus a 25.2% gain for the S&P 500. The group, then, is also benefiting from performance chasing in a market that has otherwise been resilient to selling pressure.The ITB is comprised of other housing-related stocks, like Sherwin-Williams (SHW 583.09, +3.08, +0.5%) and Home Depot (HD 220.08, +1.68, +0.8%); nevertheless, there is no denying the standout performances registered by the homebuilding stocks specifically, which have rallied on the drop in mortgage rates and favorable demand dynamics, including low unemployment and pent-up buying interest.Notable movers: D.R. Horton (DHI 55.26, +0.62, +1.1%), PulteGroup (PHM 39.78, +0.34, +0.9%); Lennar (LEN 60.10, +0.67, +1.1%), NVR, Inc. (NVR 3795.69, +74.81, +2.0%), KB Home (KBH 34.98, +0.33, +0.9%), and Beazer Homes (BZH 15.46, +0.34, +2.3%)14:07CCXI ChemoCentryx off the sessions best levels, but still higher by 270% as investors and analysts alike cheer positive Phase 3 topline data (30.17 +22.11)As covered last night, the company and Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma announced positive topline data from the pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan, an orally-administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis or ANCA vasculitis). In response to the outcome, ChemoCentryx plans to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to both the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in 2020.Surging higher on the positive result, shares traded north of $38 early this morning, good for gains of as much as 376%.

Last quarter, ADSK reported at 16:01, or one minute after the close, so it may be right after the close.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 (Oct) non-GAAP EPS is $0.72. The revenue consensus estimate is $824 mln. On August 27, ADSK guided to non-GAAP EPS of $0.70-0.74 and revenue of $820-830 mln. Full year guidance was: non-GAAP EPS of $2.69-2.81 and revenue growth pf +26-27%, which we compute as $3.24-3.15 bln. Note: ADSK typically guides for revenue and EPS in the press release for the next quarter and full year.It's important to note that the company views ARR (annualized recurring revenue) as the best proxy for measuring its progress and the overall health of the business. So that will be a metric to watch. Its current FY20 guidance is for ARR of $3.425-3.385 bln. ADSK does not guide for ARR on a quarterly basis. However, last quarter, it reported ARR of $3.07 bln. Non-GAAP operating margin is another metric to watch, Q2 came in at 23%.Of note, ADSK has been transitioning its business away from maintenance revenue and toward recurring revenue for its core design platforms. With less than 20% of revenue coming from maintenance, ADSK says it's effectively finished with its business model transition. Another big push ADSK has been making is to boost its construction offerings as it has made a number of recent acquisitions in this area.The headline last quarter was that ADSK rebounded from its first EPS miss in five years in AprQ to report nice upside in JulQ. However, ADSK also lowered full-year guidance for both EPS and revenue despite reporting upside in JulQ. ADSK said it does not expect to be materially impacted by current trade tensions and macro uncertainty, but it wanted to take a prudent stance to its second half FY20 guidance.ADSK has had a halo effect on its stock in recent years, but its last two earnings reports have tarnished that image to some degree. Nevertheless, investors seem to be brushing off concerns about the guidance as they have bid the stock up more than 20% since mid-October. This makes us a bit nervous heading into this report as investors may be too optimistic.13:49COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $4.40 (0.3%) at $1461.4/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.16 higher (0.98%) at $17.05/oz Dec copper settled $0.03 higher (1.13%) at $2.675/lb13:19OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AAOI Dec 10.5 calls are seeing interest with the underlying stock up 4% (volume: 4670, open int: 10, implied vol: ~76%, prev day implied vol: 58%).

The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.12:54SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (27.74 mln -2.98%), CCXI (22.28 mln +266.25%), PFE (13.84 mln -0.48%), MDCO (12.32 mln +0.1%)Materials: VALE (14 mln -0.25%), FCX (12.4 mln +0.13%)Industrials: GE (29.8 mln -0.65%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (31.14 mln +7.07%), DLTR (14.6 mln -16.36%), DKS (12.46 mln +19.2%)Information Technology: FIT (41.95 mln +3.61%), AMD (26.78 mln -1.91%), NOK (14.95 mln -1.3%), HPE (14.07 mln -8.68%), NTNX (12.69 mln +16.73%)Financials: BAC (20.07 mln -0.67%), ITUB (18.37 mln -3.84%)Energy: CHK (60.44 mln +2.69%), SWN (18 mln -4.36%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: CCXI (39.14x +266.25%), GBT (5.85x +4.8%), CBAY (5.48x +10.53%), MDCO (3.26x +0.1%), EDIT (2.48x +3.9%)Industrials: BECN (3.47x -10.46%)Consumer Discretionary: DLTR (9.98x -16.36%), DKS (6.98x +19.2%), MOV (5.43x -21.59%), BBY (3.85x +11.52%), CHS (2.59x +15.19%), ANF (2.56x -3%), BURL (2.53x +9.09%)Information Technology: NTNX (4.94x +16.73%), PANW (4.8x -12.03%), AMBA (2.75x -4.86%)Financials: MUFG (7.69x -0.65%), WBK (2.63x -1.32%)12:52SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: CCXI (29.52 +266.25%), ARWR (66.89 +17.37%), AUPH (7 +13%), CLVS (11.4 +10.98%), CBAY (1.47 +10.53%), ABEO (3.15 +9.76%), YMAB (32.12 +8.66%), SENS (1.04 +7.37%)Industrials: DY (54.58 +9.27%)Consumer Discretionary: DKS (47 +19.2%), CHS (4.82 +15.19%), BBY (82.8 +11.52%), BURL (227.19 +9.09%), EXPR (3.95 +7.63%), NIO (2.2 +7.07%), DESP (12.5 +6.38%), WTRH (0.4 +6.33%)Information Technology: NTNX (33.56 +16.73%), GTT (5.96 +8.8%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.12 -7.57%), XON (5.67 -6.28%), ACOR (1.79 -6.05%)Industrials: BECN (29.88 -10.46%), AZUL (35.4 -7.5%), GOL (15.36 -6.28%)Consumer Discretionary: MOV (19.76 -21.59%), DLTR (94.01 -16.36%)Information Technology: PANW (220.16 -12.03%), HPE (15.94 -8.68%), PAGS (30.88 -8.26%)Energy: MDR (0.72 -10.59%), RRC (3.51 -9.66%), WLL (4.99 -8.1%), EXTN (5.79 -7.95%), TGS (5.74 -6.29%), SDRL (1.1 -5.98%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.1 -7.3%), XXII (0.95 -7.03%)12:40DIS Walt Disney advances 2.5% to new all-time highs after Consumer Edge Research initiates coverage on shares with an Overweight rating and the NY Post reports that the company is adding roughly 1 mln new subscribers to Disney+ each day (153.25 +3.56)12:37XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (38.54 +0.39)The New Home Sales report for October was better than expected and reflected the impressive rebound in new home sales that has been unfolding this year. To wit, new home sales were up 31.6% yr/yr with double-digit percentage increases across all regions.Hearing this, it likely won't be a surprise to hear that the S&P 500 real estate sector (+1.1%) is today's best-performing sector. The only thing is, new home sales have nothing to do directly with this sector, which is populated with office REITs, retail REITs, storage REITs, specialty REITs, and residential REITs focused on rental apartment properties.Why, then, is this sector outperforming? Key factors include:The continued drop in interest rates, which increase the appeal of a sector that provides handsome dividend yields. The 10-yr note yield is 1.73% while the sector's dividend yield is 3.31%.Sector rotation into an area of the market that has trailed the broader market's breakout to a record high. This sector has declined 1.2% over the last three months versus a 9.1% gain for the S&P 500. Some see added "catch-up potential" here in a possible year-end rally effort for the broader market.With improving economic sentiment and the persistence of low interest rates, stocks in this sector are standing out for total return potential at a time when forecasts for 2020 are primarily calling for a modest gain for the S&P 500 in 2020.Notable movers:Iron Mountain (IRM 32.54, -1.51, -4.4%): one of the few losers in the group today after the storage and information management services company announced its CFO, Stuart Brown, will be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry A. Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI), has been named as his successor; IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.CBRE Group (CBRE 57.71, +1.59, +2.8%): no news, but stock has broken out to a new all-time high today, albeit on light volumeSBA Communications (SBAC 236.78, +5.24, +2.3%): no news as stock rises to challenge its 50-day moving average (239.54)American Tower (AMT 213.46, +3.74, +1.8%): no news, but drawing support after flirting with test of 200-day moving average (207.03) on Monday12:05ARWR Arrowhead sees extension of recent run to multi-year highs as shares jump 16% today in response to last night's full year financial results; shares now up 432% YTD (66.02 +9.03)As covered last night, the company reported FY19 EPS of $0.69 vs $0.73 S&P Capital IQ Consensus Estimate; revs were +946% to $168.8 mln vs $166.91 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Highlights from last night's conference call (Prepared remarks):"There are now 5 TRiMTM-enabled candidates in the clinic, 3 of which are whollyowned and 2 are partnered. Over the next month we plan to submit regulatory filings for 2 additional clinical candidates, and by the end of 2020, we intend to have 10 TRiM -enabled candidates in clinical studies targeting four different cell types. Further, we expect to be in 3 pivotal studies by the end of 2020.""We feel confident about our ability to achieve these aggressive targets, and we have good reason to believe in the ultimate success of these clinical programs for a number of reasons.""The RNAi field is just beginning what we believe to be a golden age. This modality is increasingly accepted as a reliable and powerful way to treat a variety of diseases after two decades of intensive study and development. While the potential and value of direct conjugation delivery in unlocking the potential of RNAi was clear to us by 2016, broader confidence took longer. Interestingly, the increasing validation of RNAi is growing amid a backdrop of scarcity related to companies capable of leveraging it therapeutically and near absolute scarcity of bringing RNAi outside the liver: we think we are probably years ahead of anyone else in this regard."Shares were also up 16% yesterday after Robert W. Baird upgraded the stock to Outperform in response to Novartis's (NVS) $9.7 bln buyout of Arrowhead RNAi peer Medicines Company (MDCO).11:31HPQ HP Q4 Earnings Preview (19.92 -0.23)HP is scheduled to report Q4 results tonight after the bell with a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET.As it stands, the Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q4 EPS of $0.58 (vs $0.54 a year ago) on essentially flat revenues of $15.29 bln.Q4 EPS guidance stands at $0.55-0.59.On October 3, HP provided details on its strategy and opportunities for long-term growth, along with its financial outlook for fiscal 2020. The company's plans followed weak results out of its printing segment in Q3 as well as an attempt to become a more digital-focused company.For fiscal 2020, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $2.22-2.32. Also, HP anticipates generating FCF of at least $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020. The company announced a fiscal year 2020 restructuring plan wherein it would reduce its gross global headcount by ~7-9K employees through a combination of employee exits and voluntary early retirement. The company estimates that it will incur total labor and non-labor costs of approximately $1.0 billion in connection with the restructuring and other charges, with approximately $100 million in fiscal Q4 of 2019, $500 million in fiscal 2020 and the rest split between fiscal 2021 and 2022. These actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2022. The company estimates that these actions will result in annualized gross run rate savings of about $1.0 billion by the end of fiscal 2022.Board also authorized an additional $5.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.Also increased quarterly dividend 10% to $0.1762 from $0.16/share.In August the company announced Enrique Lores will succeed Dion Weisler as CEO, effective November 1.Recent rhetoric in HPQ has surrounded a takeover attempt by Xerox (XRX). In what has become a back-and-forth battle of "we're right" -- "no, we're right," the latest rumblings are that XRX sent a letter to HPQ management basically saying that to not engage in talks would defy logic. Given the lack of communication between the two parties, XRX has expressed interest in rallying shareholder support for a deal with HPQ in lieu of agreeing on a deal with HPQ management directly. At last check HPQ has rejected a proposal from XRX for a reported $22/share.The aforementioned "talks" with XRX have pushed the stock to three-month highs into the print as the stock has recently reclaimed the 200-day SMA (19.55).We'd also point out that XRX counts activist giant Carl Icahn as a large investor. As of his latest 13F filing (Nov. 14) Icahn held nearly 23.5 million shares of XRX.All indications are, though, that HPQ will likely not comment on these latest developments in the XRX battle during this quarter's conference call. The likely outcome of these -- what have become hostile -- takeover talks is that HPQ will reiterate its stance that it prefers to be an independent company.Ahead of tonight's print HPQ garners a $29.5 billion market capitalization and trades at about 9.1x forward earnings expectations vs peers Dell's (DELL) 7.8x, and Xerox's (XRX) 9.8x multiples.11:24TALKX Market Briefing: More of the sameThe major indices are sporting modest gains in another resilient showing that has kept broader selling efforts in check. The underlying sources of support remain much the same:Enduring hope the U.S. and China will reach a Phase One trade deal after China's Ministry of Commerce said senior officials from both sides had a phone call today and agreed on how to properly resolve relevant issues.A fear of missing out on further gains.Low interest rates. The 10-yr yield is down three basis points today to 1.73% (it hit 1.94% on Nov. 11).Low volatility. The CBOE Volatility index is down 0.9% to 11.75, which is its lowest level since April.Continued strength (and leadership) from the information technology sector (+0.3%).The financial sector (-0.4%) is a notable laggard today, pulling back along with interest rates and a yield curve that has been compressing. Overall, though, there isn't a ton of movement within the 11 sectors.Outsized moves have been reserved mostly for individual stocks. Several retailers, which reported their earnings results, jump out in that regard: Best Buy (BBY 80.79, +6.54, +8.8%), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.51, +8.08, +20.5%), Dollar Tree Stores (DLTR 95.92, -16.47, -14.7%), Movado (MOV 19.51, -5.69, -22.6%), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF 15.90, -0.43, -2.6%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%; the S&P 500 is up 0.2%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:15SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- ChemoCentryx (CCXI) soars following avacopan results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCCXI (30.9 +283.33%): Announced top-line data from the pivotal, global Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis; the study met both of its primary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care. BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of avacopan subjects vs 70.1% of control group subjects. Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of avacopan subjects vs 54.9% in the control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care. Acavopan subjects also reportedly experienced further additional benefits vs control, including reduction in glucocorticoid-related toxicity and improvement in kidney function and health-related quality of life metrics. Safety results revealed an "acceptable" safety profile. Together with its partner, VFMCRP, co intends to make regulatory submissions for full marketing approval to the EMA and the FDA in 2020. Target raised at firms including H.C. Wainwright (to $40) and Piper Jaffray (to $54). At all-time highs.AUPH (6.91 +11.63%): The stock spikes to its highest levels since March on above average volume. We noted unusual action in co's Dec 9 calls yesterday (see 11/25 13:16 OPTNX). In upcoming events for co, co announced in October that efficacy and safety results from its AURORA Phase 3 study with voclosporin for the treatment of lupus nephritus were on-track to be reported by the end of the fourth quarter 2019.CHS (4.60 +10.05%): Rises to eight-month highs after topping consensus for Q3 EPS and revs. Comps fell 2.2% yr/yr vs guidance for a low to mid-single-digit decline, improving sequentially for all brands, including by 10.4 percentage points at White House Black Market and by 2 points at co's largest brand, Chico's. The comp sales decline was driven by lower average dollar sale, partially offset by an increase in transaction count. Updated its FY guidance to "reflect improvements in the business and tariff impact."Small Cap LosersMOV (19.35 -23.21%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (fell 1.6% yr/yr to $205.62 mln).

The markets got a pop after reports surfaced that Liu He, Steve Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer conducted a phone call yesterday evening in which the two sides agreed to keep communicating over the remaining details of the Phase One deal. The call itself gave the S&P a spike up to 3145, but that was reversed when further details emerged that the call did not amount to anything of substance. Nonetheless, the S&P is currently trading about a point lower around 3132. This is slightly off the overnight low of 3128.00.In Asia, the Nikkei made a 52-week high, while the Shanghai was flat.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively).

Senate Homeland Security Committee Issues Testimony From Cybersecurity &#38; Infrastructure Security AgencyTargeted News ServiceNovember 1, 2019 Friday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4018 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued the following testimony by Christopher Krebs, director at Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within the Homeland Security Department, at a hearing entitled "Supply Chain Security, Global Competitiveness, and 5G":"Thank you for today's opportunity to testify regarding the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) ongoing efforts to secure our telecommunications infrastructure. Thanks to Congress's leadership and passage of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-278) nearly one year ago today. CISA is now even better poised to achieve our important critical infrastructure security and resilience mission.Understanding the Threat"Cyber threats remain one of the most significant strategic risks for the United States, threatening our national security, economic prosperity, and public health and safety. We have seen advanced persistent threat actors, including hackers, cyber criminals, and nation-states, increase the frequency and sophistication of their attacks. In a 2018 report, Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace, the U.S.'s National Counterintelligence and Security Center stated, "We anticipate that China, Russia, and Iran will remain aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace." Our adversaries have been developing and using advanced cyber capabilities in attempts to undermine critical infrastructure, target our livelihoods and innovation, steal our national security secrets, and threaten our democratic institutions."During his annual Worldwide Threat Assessment testimony before Congress this January, the Director of National Intelligence stated, "China presents a persistent cyber espionage threat and a growing attack threat to our core military and critical infrastructure systems. China remains the most active strategic competitor responsible for cyber espionage against the US Government, corporations, and allies." The Director further stated, "We are also concerned about the potential for Chinese intelligence and security services to use Chinese information technology firms as routine and systemic espionage platforms against the United States and allies." This assessment is consistent with the fact that Chinese laws on national security and cybersecurity provide the Chinese government with a legal basis to compel technology companies operating in China to cooperate with Chinese security services."Increasingly, many or most discussion around cybersecurity threats include some risk calculation around supply chain, third party, or vendor assurance risk. In fact, a 2018 Symantec report detailed that the number of observed supply chain attacks was 78 percent higher in 2018 than it was in 2017, as malicious actors sought to exploit vulnerabilities in third-party software, hardware, and services."Supply Chain Risk can broadly be understood as efforts by our adversaries to exploit ICT technologies and their related supply chains for purposes of espionage, sabotage, and foreign interference activity. Vulnerabilities in supply chains - either developed intentionally for malicious intent or unintentionally through poor security practices - can enable data and intellectual property theft, loss of confidence in the integrity of the system, or exploitation to cause system and network failure. Increasingly, our adversaries are looking at these vulnerabilities as a principal attack vector, and we are increasingly concerned with aggressive actions, by potential foreign adversaries to include Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.Roles and Responsibilities"CISA, our government partners, and the private sector are all engaging in a more strategic and unified approach towards improving our nation's overall defensive posture against malicious cyber activity. In May of 2018, the Department published the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy, outlining a strategic framework to execute our cybersecurity responsibilities during the next five years. The National Cyber Strategy, released in September 2018, reiterates the criticality of collaboration and strengthens the government's commitment to work in partnership with industry to combat cyber threats and secure our critical infrastructure. Together, the National Cyber Strategy and DHS Cybersecurity Strategy guide CISA's efforts."CISA works across government and critical infrastructure industry partnerships to lead the national effort to safeguard and secure cyberspace. We share timely and actionable classified and unclassified information as well as provide training and technical assistance. Our work enhances cyber threat information sharing between and among governments and businesses across the globe to stop cyber incidents before they occur and quickly recover when they do. By bringing together the intelligence community, law enforcement, the Department of Defense, Sector-Specific Agencies, all levels of government, the private sector, international partners, and the public, we are enabling collective defense against cybersecurity risks, improving our incident response capabilities, enhancing information sharing of best practices and cyber threats, strengthening our resilience, and facilitating safety."In addition to our cross-sector leadership role, CISA is the Sector-Specific Agency for numerous sectors, notably the Information Technology and Communications Sectors. In this role, we work with a range of stakeholders to address both short-term and longer-term challenges regarding risks to telecommunications networks, including supply chain risk management and 5G security. These stakeholders include the Department of Justice, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Federal Communications Commission, General Services Administration, the intelligence community, and the private sector."To manage and address the risks posed by 5G, the U.S. government is taking an interagency approach to this issue, led by the White House. National Security Council (NSC) Cybersecurity Directorate and the National Economic Council co-lead a regular 5G interagency Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) through the National Security Presidential Memoranda (NSPM) - 4 process. These meetings are an opportunity to discuss and come to decisions on key 5G issues, such as participation in standards bodies, as well as to provide updates on interagency 5G activities."Reducing ICT supply chain risk is a national security imperative and one that is a key pillar of CISA's Strategic Intent. While many components of CISA play some role in supporting supply chain initiatives, the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) leads the agency-wide supply chain coordination effort - providing program management and analytical support to current lines of effort. These include:* The ICT Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force* ICT analysis in support of Executive Order 13873: Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain* 5G mobile communications security and resilience efforts"CISA's supply chain risk management efforts are closely integrated with the agency's broader critical infrastructure protection mission. Supply chain risk cuts across many of the 55 National Critical Functions released by CISA in April, and the National Critical Functions framework continues to be an effective platform for holistically understanding and prioritizing risk to our nation's critical infrastructure.ICT Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force"In 2018, CISA established the Information and Communication Technology Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force as a public-private partnership jointly chaired by CISA and the chairs of the IT and Communications Sector Coordinating Councils. The Task Force is working to identify and manage risks to the global ICT supply chain and is comprised of 40 industry partners from the IT and Communications Sectors and 20 interagency partners from the United States Government."The first year of the Task Force focused on four priority areas of policy concern for supply chain risk management, including: Information Sharing, Threat Evaluation, Qualified Bidder Lists and Qualified Manufacture Lists, and Policy Recommendations to Incentive Purchase of ICT from Original Equipment Manufacturers and Authorized Resellers."In September of this year, the Task Force released an Interim Report providing a status update on activities and objectives of the Task Force. The report outlines the overall structure of the Task Force as well as the four Working Groups, areas of discussion, and relevant key findings. The Interim Report serves as an important building block for the second year of the Task Force, including strategic priorities and recommendations."Among these priorities is enhancing the information sharing about supply chain risks with a particular focus on potential bad actors. The Task Force identified current gaps in the ability of government to collect relevant information on bad actors, the ability to use that information as part of an overall evaluation of trusted vendors, and the ability for that information to be shared with the private sector. Crucially, the Task Force also identified limitations on private-to-private information sharing on supply chain risks because of lingering legal concerns. Going forward, the Task Force is establishing a Working Group of lawyers from industry and government to address these hurdles and make recommendations for legal and regulatory changes; in addition, the Task Force is likely to identify the necessary components of an enhanced information sharing environment that can take advantage of factors that contribute to understanding as to whether vendors can be trusted."Another effort of the Task Force will be related to taking the output of a list of the Threat Evaluation Working Group - which identified nine types of supply chain threats and related scenarios - and making recommendations as to how the identified threats and threat scenarios can inform risk management programs for government agencies, and large and small businesses alike. These threats - whether from counterfeit parts, insider threats, poor cybersecurity practices, or market forces - need to be accounted for in effective supply chain risk management programs."In addition, to its Working Groups, the Task Force has emerged as a key private sector touch point for the recently launched Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC). All agencies participating in the FASC also have representatives on the Task Force - a deliberately designed synergy. And, we recently completed an agency-wide data call for the FASC and the Task Force that identified supply chain risk management programs from across government for the purpose of increasing integration and synchronization of efforts across the Executive Branch.ICT Criticality Analysis"On May 15, 2019, the President signed Executive Order (EO) 13873: Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain. This EO declares a national emergency with respect to the threat posed by foreign adversaries to the nation's information and communications technology supply chain. Specifically, the EO addresses concerns that "foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services, which store and communicate vast amounts of sensitive information, facilitate the digital economy, and support critical infrastructure and vital emergency services, in order to commit malicious cyber-enabled actions, including economic and industrial espionage against the United States.""DHS, specifically CISA, plays a key role in EO 13873. Section 5(b) requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to "assess and identify entities, hardware, software, and services that present vulnerabilities in the United States that pose the greatest potential consequences to the national security of the United States." The Secretary of DHS, in coordination with sector-specific agencies and coordinating councils as appropriate, was required to submit an assessment within 80 days of issuance of the EO and annually thereafter. The assessment was required to include an "evaluation of hardware, software, or services that are relied upon by multiple information and communications technology or service providers, including the communication services relied upon by critical infrastructure entities identified pursuant to section 9 of Executive Order 13636.""The Secretary of DHS delegated this responsibility to CISA. To carry out this responsibility, CISA has engaged with its federal and private sector partners to provide assessments of ICT hardware, software, and services to determine which pose the greatest threats and vulnerabilities to US critical infrastructure."CISA will soon release the methodology it used in its assessment in support of the EO. The methodology includes a deconstruction of the ICT supply chain into 61 elements - the hardware, software, and services "building blocks" - that collectively make up the ICT ecosystem. CISA hopes that this elemental deconstruction will have lasting value for supply chain risk management activity beyond this EO."Among the elements that CISA designated as critical for focusing supply chain risk reduction efforts were Home Subscriber Services, Mobile Switching Centers, and Sensitive Systems Software (to include software defined networking). Untrustworthy equipment in those supply chains could create an unacceptable amount of risk to the national security of the United States. There would likely be significant regional or national impacts, including affecting operations and the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data or the system, and the ability to effectively mitigate these risks is uncertain or unsatisfactory.5G"With that finding in mind, DHS - and our interagency partners - recognize 5G deployment as a significant area for national and economic security intention. The Fifth Generation Communications Network (5G) is the next generation of wireless technology that represents a complete transformation of telecommunication networks. Combining new and legacy technology and infrastructure, 5G will build upon previous generations in an evolution that will occur over many years, utilizing existing infrastructure and technology."From my perspective, 5G is the single biggest critical infrastructure build that the globe has seen in the last 25 years and, coupled with the growth of cloud computing, automation, and future of artificial intelligence, demands focused attention today to secure tomorrow."5G builds upon existing telecommunication infrastructure by improving the bandwidth, capacity, and reliability of wireless broadband services. The evolution will take years, but the goal is to meet increasing data and communication requirements, including capacity for tens of billions of connected devices that will make up the Internet of Things (IoT), ultra-low latency required for critical near-real time data transmission, and faster speeds to support emerging technologies. As of June 2019, 5G networks and technologies are in development with a limited rollout in select cities around the world, including 20 in the United States."DHS, working with its interagency and industry partners, has an opportunity to help shape the rollout of this emerging critical infrastructure, increasing its security and resilience at the design phase and reducing national security risk from an untrustworthy 5G network. Our intent in doing so is to promote the development and deployment of a secure and resilient 5G infrastructure that enables enhanced national security, technological innovation, and economic opportunity for the United States and its allied partners."Our work in this area will be focused on six lines of effort, to include:* Support the design and deployment of 5G networks with security and resilience in mind, to include investing in Research &#38; Development* Promote 5G use cases that are secure and trustworthy* Identify and communicate risks - including supply chain risks - to 5G infrastructure* Promote development and deployment of trusted 5G components* Advance the United States' global effort to influence direction of allied nations in 5G deployments* Provide leadership role within USG to coordinate operational 5G security and resilience efforts"The analogy of the space race is not entirely incorrect for 5G deployment, but I view it more as a competition between differing views of the world - one in which technology is deployed that protects the values of privacy, enables greater confidence amongst citizenry in essential services, and creates greater connectivity and economic opportunity while not undermining the ability of countries and communities to protect themselves; and, one that views technology as an enabler of illegitimate behavior."The United States' goal needs to be to do whatever we can to lead the world to the former vision. Industry will be a partner in all of this effort - so, too, will like-minded countries. One particular focus needs to be on ensuring that state-influenced entities do not dominate a market through unfair business practices and to potentially do the work of adversary action. As such, a particular concern that the Department of Homeland Security is focusing on regards the growing presence of Chinese telecom equipment in the Radio Access Network (RAN) portion of the network where there are a limited number of RAN equipment suppliers. There are five main purveyors of 5G RAN technology globally, the largest of which is Chinese-based. If Chinese manufacturers continue to gain market share, there will be growing concern about the long-term viability of the existing supply chain for 5G and successor technologies. As such, it is important for the U.S. and its allies to continue to promote market dynamism and support existing trusted-vendors in the space while investing in innovation and research and development that will help the trusted community win the quality battle in the RAN, innovate to a future 5G, and compete on a level playing field in the market. This is particularly necessary to help support deployment across the United States, including in rural communities.DHS Advisory Councils"CISA is working through the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) structure to engage with private sector stakeholders, especially the Communications and Information Technology Sector Coordinating Councils and the Enduring Security Framework Operations Working Group to collaborate on the risk posed by 5G technologies."CISA operates the Communications Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), a partnership of 11 federal agencies and over 60 private sector communications and information technology companies. Some of these companies maintain a permanent presence in CISA's operations center. Through the Communications ISAC, government and industry exchange vulnerability, threat, intrusion, and anomaly information. CISA also uses this mechanism to maintain situational awareness regarding the evolution of 5G standards and carrier 5G plans."The President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), created in 1982, provides industry-based analyses and recommendations to the President and the Executive Branch regarding policy and enhancements to national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications. It is composed of up to 30 presidentially appointed senior executives who represent various elements of the telecommunications industry. NSTAC is supported by the Secretary of Homeland Security, who is the Executive Agent."NSTAC has reviewed 5G security issues, including when it finalized its NSTAC Report to the President on Emerging Technologies Strategic Vision on July 14, 2017. The report included recommendations on how the government can adapt to "unprecedented growth and transformation in the technology ecosystem over the next decade," including 5G technology, which the NSTAC identified as a near-term transformative technology."The NSTAC is currently examining technology capabilities that are critical to NS/EP functions in the evolving ICT ecosystem. On April 2, 2019, the NSTAC submitted a letter to the President outlining the first phase of its study to identify the technologies within the ICT ecosystem that are most critical to the Government's NS/EP functions, which include 5G, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence."During the second phase of this study, the NSTAC plans to examine how certain dependencies, market limitations, and supply chain risks began, using the deployment of 5G technologies as a case study. The NSTAC will formulate recommendations for the recommended national innovation NS/EP ICT strategy. This strategy will ensure that the United States is more resilient, has access to trusted technology to support its NS/EP mission, and leads in the development and use of ICT technology.Research and Development"The next age of digital transformation depends on the success of the United States' national and global 5G build out. Significant research remains to be done in this area as well as hardening of the 5G network protocols, which are currently in early development. On April 22, 2019, DHS's Science and Technology Directorate and CISA announced an effort related to the development of new standards to improve the security and resilience of critical mobile communications networks. This solicitation established a research and development project for innovative approaches and technologies to protect legacy, current, and 5G mobile network communications services and equipment against all threats and vulnerabilities."The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union (ITU) lead the global 5G standards development initiatives. CISA currently works with industry, including nationwide US wireless carriers, in preparing technical standards for the standards development organizations to ensure Public Safety and NS/EP personnel will have priority communications services on 5G networks.Conclusion"In the face of increasingly sophisticated threats, CISA employees stand on the front lines of the Federal Government's efforts to defend our Nation's federal networks and critical infrastructure. The threat environment is complex and dynamic with interdependencies that add to the challenge. As new risks emerge, we must better integrate cyber and physical risk in order to effectively secure the Nation. CISA contributes unique expertise and capabilities around cyber-physical risk and cross-sector critical infrastructure interdependencies."A holistic understanding of critical infrastructure risk must take into account the supply chain risk stemming from an interconnected society that relies heavily on ICT technology as the supporting backbone of many National Critical Functions. As CISA continues to mature its engagement on supply chain risk management and 5G security and resilience lines of effort, the agency is also working on developing a lasting technological architecture and framework to allow for better structured supply chain risk analysis. We believe investing in this capability will be critical to fully achieving CISA's critical infrastructure mission in the years to come."I recognize and appreciate this Committee's strong support and diligence as it works to understand this emerging risk and identify additional authorities and resources needed to address it head on. We at CISA are committed to working with Congress to ensure our efforts cultivate a safer, more secure, and resilient Homeland through our efforts to defend today and secure tomorrow."Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee today, and I look forward to your questions."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6912053 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 1, 2019End of Document

FCC bans use of USF funds for Huawei, ZTE equipmentFierceWirelessNovember 22, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 1318 wordsByline: Bevin FletcherHighlight: The agency also adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would require carriers remove and replace existing equipment from Huawei and ZTE.BodyThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Friday voted unanimously to ban the use of Universal Service Fund (USF) dollars to purchase telecom equipment and services from vendors that pose risks to national security, specifically China's Huawei and ZTE.The annual $8.5 billion USF subsidizes U.S. broadband deployment through four separate programs, with many recipients providing coverage in rural or underserved areas of the country.The order initially designates Huawei and ZTE as “covered” companies that USF recipients can't use gear or services from, with the option to add additional entities in the future. Huawei and ZTE were previously flagged as national security threats because of their close ties to the Chinese government, which the U.S. has indicated could force the companies to act as apparatuses for state-sponsored activities like espionage, malware attacks and theft of U.S. data through their presence in the country's telecommunications networks.RELATED: Commissioner Starks: ‘Network security is national security'The U.S. has been actively campaigning for allies around the world to keep Huawei equipment from 5G networks over security concerns. Distributed processing in 5G networks makes the radio access network (RAN) even more vulnerable in the event of an attack, according Commissioner Geoffrey Starks' report.“While many talk of security issues surrounding ‘back doors,' I have said many times that the untrustworthy equipment from these companies could readily serve as a ‘front door' for Chinese intelligence gathering, at the expense of our privacy and national security,” Starks said in his prepared remarks. “I fully support the effort to ban future purchases of such equipment using USF funds.”Huawei, which has also found itself in the center of U.S.-China trade tensions, has denied allegations that it would spy or disrupt networks for the purposes of China.In an emailed statement, Huawei called the FCC's actions “unwarranted,” adding “Huawei believes this order is unlawful as the FCC has singled out Huawei based on national security, but it provides no evidence that Huawei poses a security risk. Instead, the FCC simply assumes, based on a mistaken view of Chinese law, that Huawei might come under Chinese government control.”Rip and replaceIn addition to the order, the FCC adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would require carriers using USF funds, and potentially even those that are not, to remove and replace existing equipment from Huawei and ZTE that's already present in U.S. networks and seeks comment on how to fund the process.Most carriers in the U.S. don't use equipment from Huawei, but the Chinese vendor has more of a presence in rural America, in part because of its lower-cost equipment and willingness to work with smaller operators.Still, the process to identify, remove and replace existing gear could prove to be a major and expensive undertaking. Starks has been spearheading efforts to address the issue and convened a workshop earlier this summer with various stakeholders. Some estimates peg the cost of a rip-and-replace approach as higher than $1 billion, with per-cell site costs ranging from $70,000 to $130,000, according to Starks' report (PDF) on findings from the workshop, released Thursday.RELATED: House bill asks for $1B to rip and replace Huawei equipmentThe U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee has introduced a bill to authorize $1 billion to aid smaller telecom providers rip and replace Huawei equipment.In terms of banning future purchases of Huawei and ZTE equipment using federal funds, all five FCC members were united in their support and voted in favor. At Friday's open meeting, both commissioners Brendan Carr and Jessica Rosenworcel used the example of the Malmstrom Air Force Base and the 341st Missile Wing where they said 150 intercontinental ballistic missiles are loaded in underground silos across northern Montana, but surrounded by clusters of cell towers operated by a small wireless provider. “You might not know it when you look at them, but these towers represent a bigger risk to our national security than the missiles they surround,” said Rosenworcel. “That's because the communications equipment that hangs on these towers is from Huawei and we have good reason to believe that it's susceptible to undue foreign influence and control.”She acknowledged that in rural areas Chinese equipment is less costly to deploy and therefore has sometimes been the only economical option for delivering wireless service to less populated rural areas, sometimes located in and around sensitive U.S. military bases.RELATED: Commerce Dept. bans Huawei, 70 affiliates from sourcing U.S. components“But it gets worse. This insecure equipment has been subsidized by the United States government and this very agency,” she said. “It was purchased with money from the Universal Service Fund at the FCC. If a foreign government ever chose to exploit the radio transmitters that have been placed alongside key military installations, it could suck up sensitive data, shut down service, or launch Denial of Service attacks.”Moving to 5G, insecure equipment could take cybersecurity risks to “entirely new levels” as they support a broader range of mission critical applications, according to Rosenworcel.Carr indicated a similar sentiment. “This is not just a concern for the military,” he said in prepared remarks. “Everything we do in modern society now runs on interconnected networks, from banking, to transportation, and even our power grids. This will become only more so as carriers continue to build out 5G networks.”Huawei in its statement urged the FCC to refrain from finalizing the designation, which it said would negatively impact “connectivity for Americans in rural and underserved areas” in the U.S., saying “Huawei is an international leader in developing and adopting mechanisms to improve cybersecurity to protect the reliability of its equipment and the privacy of consumers. And Huawei has remained open to engaging with the U.S. government to verify productive solutions to safeguard U.S. telecommunications systems.”Still, even as the FCC voted to prohibit the use of government funding for future purchases of Chinese telecom equipment and services, the situation with Huawei remains uncertain as the company is caught within both trade and security issues with the U.S.RELATED: Rural carriers get another 90-day extension to work with HuaweiEarlier this week, the U.S. government granted a third 90-day extension for U.S companies to continue working with Huawei, after the Chinese vendor was placed on the Commerce Department's Entity List earlier this year over national security concerns. That effectively blacklisted Huawei from buying technology components that pose a security risk from U.S. firms without approval, but also impacted rural carriers with existing Huawei network equipment.The extension allows carriers to continue maintenance activities with Huawei, such as running software updates and patches, Competitive Carriers Association SVP and general counsel Alexi Maltas previously told FierceWireless.The U.S. government also this week granted Microsoft's request for a license to export software to Huawei, which has been pressured the last six months since being blacklisted.According to Reuters, roughly one-quarter of 300 license requests from U.S. companies have been approved, while half have not been processed yet.Citing an unnamed source familiar with the process, Reuters said some licenses included sales of cell phone components and non-electronic components.Huawei is both a telecom equipment giant and leading smartphone maker, and the licensing issue means among other things, it hasn't had access to Google's proprietary Android operating services. So new Huawei handsets launched without the popular and familiar Google Play Store for apps.Load-Date: November 22, 2019End of Document

Chinese National Faces Indictment For Economic EspionageThe FrontrunnerNovember 22, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 145 wordsBodyReuters (11/21, Beech) reports, "A Chinese national who worked for Monsanto before it was purchased by Bayer AG was charged in St. Louis, Missouri, on Thursday with stealing trade secrets for China, the U.S. Justice Department said." Haitao Xiang, "an employee of Monsanto and its Climate Corp subsidiary from 2008 to 2017, was stopped by federal officials at a U.S. airport before he could board a flight to China carrying proprietary farming software, the department said in a statement." Assistant Attorney General John Demers said, "The indictment alleges another example of the Chinese government using Talent Plans to encourage employees to steal intellectual property from their U.S. employers." China announced its "Thousand Talents Plan" in 2008 "to recruit scientific researchers, which authorities in Washington have called a threat to U.S. national security."Load-Date: November 22, 2019End of Document

There isn't any real news to account for the current disposition, but that may just be the reason why there is a positive bias, as no news is good news for a market being pushed by sentiment.In Asia/Pacific, trading action was relatively subdued. Markets in Australia and Hong Kong remained closed for holiday. China's Shanghai Composite jumped 0.9%, helped by talk of increased infrastructure spending in early 2020 and positive sentiment regarding an easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

The agreement for the sale of the wastewater collection system, which serves 12,500 customer connections, is for $18 mln. The company expects to close the transaction in late 2020.10:43XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (125.04 +0.50)The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is today's second-best performing group, trailing only the energy sector (+0.7%). The sector is now up 0.5% for the week versus a 0.4% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500.Today's outperformance is being driven by relative strength in a handful of retailers after Mastercard SpendingPulse reported that holiday retail sales grew 3.4% yr/yr while online sales surged 18.8% yr/yr. These growth rates are likely a bit more optimistic than what will be shown by final results, considering that UPS (UPS 118.77, +0.44, +0.4%) expects to process a record 1.9 mln returns on January 2.

That would include the likes of Apple (AAPL 287.48, +3.21, +1.1%), Microsoft (MSFT 158.15, +0.77, +0.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1824.06, +34.85, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1349.56, +6.00, +0.5%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.58, +1.00, +0.7%), and Facebook (FB 207.08, +1.96, +1.0%) to name a few.Amazon is a stock in the news, as it reported having a record-breaking holiday season. On a related note, MasterCard Spending Pulse said retail sales, excluding autos, were up 3.4% year-over-year for November 1 through December 24.Overall, today's news has been limited, which isn't unusual for the day after Christmas when many market participants and non-participants alike remain on holiday.The stock market, therefore, is still riding on positive sentiment that has been sustained in the absence of any negative news shocks, a seeming promise from the Fed that it won't be raising rates anytime soon, and an easing of trade tension between the U.S and China.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.5%; the S&P 500 is up 0.3%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is up 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is flat.10:46AWK American Water Works subsidiary Illinois American Water acquires Granite City wastewater collection system for $18 mln (122.29 +0.67)Illinois American Water, a subsidiary of American Water, has entered into an agreement with Granite City to acquire the City's wastewater collection assets. The agreement for the sale of the wastewater collection system, which serves 12,500 customer connections, is for $18 mln. The company expects to close the transaction in late 2020.10:43XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (125.04 +0.50)The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is today's second-best performing group, trailing only the energy sector (+0.7%). The sector is now up 0.5% for the week versus a 0.4% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500.Today's outperformance is being driven by relative strength in a handful of retailers after Mastercard SpendingPulse reported that holiday retail sales grew 3.4% yr/yr while online sales surged 18.8% yr/yr. These growth rates are likely a bit more optimistic than what will be shown by final results, considering that UPS (UPS 118.77, +0.44, +0.4%) expects to process a record 1.9 mln returns on January 2. This would translate to yr/yr growth of 26.0%.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 45.79, +0.07, +0.2%) touched an eight-month high before narrowing its gain to 0.2%, which underscores the fact that only some retail stocks trade with big gains.Notable movers:Amazon (AMZN 1821.26, +32.05, +1.8%): leading sector component, returning to its 200-day moving average (1824.51) after record-breaking holiday sales. Ralph Lauren (RL 118.11, +0.46, +0.4%): set a fresh six-month high today. Under Armour (UA 19.45, +0.05, +0.2%): trading at its best level since the start of August. Marriot (MAR 152.28, +0.78, +0.5%): trading at a fresh record. CarMax (KMX 88.03, -0.83, -0.9%): weakest sector component, falling to its lowest level since early October after reporting mixed results last week.10:29OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CRWD Weekly Dec27 50 calls are seeing interest with 2720 contracts trading vs. open int of 120, pushing implied vol up around 20 points to ~67%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.It's been a modest advance on this day after Christmas, with investors waking up to positive holiday sales figures. For the period Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr while online sales rose 18.8%, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse.Amazon (AMZN 1846.30, +57.44, +3.2%) reportedly said it had another record-breaking holiday season, and the positive reaction to the news is contributing to the outperformance of the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+0.9%). UPS (UPS 118.96, +0.63, +0.5%), however, is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2.Mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL 288.21, +3.94, +1.4%), Facebook (FB 206.94, +1.81, +0.9%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.78, +1.20, +0.9%) provide further support for the broader market, while the S&P 500 health care (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and materials (unch) sectors struggle to keep pace.Positive sentiment is carrying stocks higher in a lighter-volume day, but some profit taking appeared to knock the broader market from session highs after the Nasdaq hit the 9000 level. In this context, "knock" translates to about four points in the S&P 500.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady, with the benchmark 10-yr yield unchanged at 1.91%. WTI crude ($61.67/bbl, +0.56, +0.9%) and gold futures ($1514.00/ozt, +9.40, +0.6%) are both up, while the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the weekly reports for jobless claims and mortgage applications.Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected. Continuing claims for the week ending December 14 decreased by 6,000 to 1.719 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have picked up some from the cyclical bottom, but remain at a level that is still indicative of a tight labor market.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications declined 5.3% following a 5.0% decline in the prior week.12:55SNAP Snap advances more than 3%, reaching its highest levels since early October (16.11 +0.50)Hearing that the stock was mentioned on CNBC earlier this afternoon.12:07SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Spectrum Pharma (SPPI) sinks following poziotinib data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersSILV (7.48 +12.96%): Spiked to new all-time highs on more than 2x average volume. Co today disclosed in a filing that its auditor has changed from Davidson & Company LLP to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP upon Davidson's resignation; there were no modified opinions expressed in the auditor's reports of Davidson on co's annual financial statements for the financial years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Silver and gold stocks generally gain. (Related: EQX, MUX...) SUPV (4.14 +10.4%): Posts an advance alongside various Argentine peers; the Global X Argentina ETF (ARGT), seeing continued strength, today records gains of close to +3%, now higher by circa +18% month-to-date.

The stock has now gained circa +114% over the course of about the last week, following its report of upside Q3 earnings.Small Cap LosersSPPI (3.8 -56.57%): Drops to three-year lows after reporting that the pre-specified primary endpoint in its Phase 2 trial evaluating poziotinib in previously treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations was not met in Cohort 1. The intent-to-treat analysis of the cohort, which enrolled 115 patients, showed that 17 patients had a response and 62 patients had stable disease, for a 68.7% disease control rate. The confirmed ORR was 14.8%, and median duration of response was 7.4 months. The futility analysis has been concluded for Cohorts 2 and 3, which met their minimum threshold of responses to continue; read outs for those cohorts are expected in 2020. Also announced that the FDA has accepted for review the BLA for ROLONTIS for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. HEXO (1.56 -20.66%): Touched down to two-year lows after announcing its entrance into a definitive agreement with institutional investors for the purchase and sale of 14,970,062 common shares at $1.67/share, for gross proceeds of $25.0 mln. Co has also agreed to issue to the investors common share purchase warrants to purchase 7,485,032 of co's common shares.

It has been a slow, but steady, grind higher since the opening bell with most sectors registering modest gains. The energy (+0.7%), information technology (+0.5%), and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors are leading the way.The real key, though, is that most of the market's most heavily-weighted stocks are trading higher. That would include the likes of Apple (AAPL 287.48, +3.21, +1.1%), Microsoft (MSFT 158.15, +0.77, +0.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1824.06, +34.85, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1349.56, +6.00, +0.5%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.58, +1.00, +0.7%), and Facebook (FB 207.08, +1.96, +1.0%) to name a few.Amazon is a stock in the news, as it reported having a record-breaking holiday season. On a related note, MasterCard Spending Pulse said retail sales, excluding autos, were up 3.4% year-over-year for November 1 through December 24.Overall, today's news has been limited, which isn't unusual for the day after Christmas when many market participants and non-participants alike remain on holiday.The stock market, therefore, is still riding on positive sentiment that has been sustained in the absence of any negative news shocks, a seeming promise from the Fed that it won't be raising rates anytime soon, and an easing of trade tension between the U.S and China.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.5%; the S&P 500 is up 0.3%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is up 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is flat.10:46AWK American Water Works subsidiary Illinois American Water acquires Granite City wastewater collection system for $18 mln (122.29 +0.67)Illinois American Water, a subsidiary of American Water, has entered into an agreement with Granite City to acquire the City's wastewater collection assets. The agreement for the sale of the wastewater collection system, which serves 12,500 customer connections, is for $18 mln. The company expects to close the transaction in late 2020.10:43XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (125.04 +0.50)The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is today's second-best performing group, trailing only the energy sector (+0.7%). The sector is now up 0.5% for the week versus a 0.4% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500.Today's outperformance is being driven by relative strength in a handful of retailers after Mastercard SpendingPulse reported that holiday retail sales grew 3.4% yr/yr while online sales surged 18.8% yr/yr. These growth rates are likely a bit more optimistic than what will be shown by final results, considering that UPS (UPS 118.77, +0.44, +0.4%) expects to process a record 1.9 mln returns on January 2. This would translate to yr/yr growth of 26.0%.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 45.79, +0.07, +0.2%) touched an eight-month high before narrowing its gain to 0.2%, which underscores the fact that only some retail stocks trade with big gains.Notable movers:Amazon (AMZN 1821.26, +32.05, +1.8%): leading sector component, returning to its 200-day moving average (1824.51) after record-breaking holiday sales. Ralph Lauren (RL 118.11, +0.46, +0.4%): set a fresh six-month high today. Under Armour (UA 19.45, +0.05, +0.2%): trading at its best level since the start of August. Marriot (MAR 152.28, +0.78, +0.5%): trading at a fresh record. CarMax (KMX 88.03, -0.83, -0.9%): weakest sector component, falling to its lowest level since early October after reporting mixed results last week.10:29OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CRWD Weekly Dec27 50 calls are seeing interest with 2720 contracts trading vs. open int of 120, pushing implied vol up around 20 points to ~67%.

The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy (+0.5%) and consumer discretionary (+0.5%) sectors leading the modest advance. Conversely, the health care (-0.1%) and utilities (unch) sectors are today's early laggards.U.S. Treasuries trade near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is down two basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.90%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.61.

Markets in Australia and Hong Kong remained closed for holiday.

Reports later indicated that certain suitors may still be interested in co. Resumed with an Underperform at BofA/Merrill. Drops to its lowest levels since early November.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.It's been a modest advance on this day after Christmas, with investors waking up to positive holiday sales figures. For the period Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr while online sales rose 18.8%, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse.Amazon (AMZN 1846.30, +57.44, +3.2%) reportedly said it had another record-breaking holiday season, and the positive reaction to the news is contributing to the outperformance of the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+0.9%).

The confirmed ORR was 14.8%, and median duration of response was 7.4 months.

It has been a slow, but steady, grind higher since the opening bell with most sectors registering modest gains. The energy (+0.7%), information technology (+0.5%), and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors are leading the way.The real key, though, is that most of the market's most heavily-weighted stocks are trading higher. That would include the likes of Apple (AAPL 287.48, +3.21, +1.1%), Microsoft (MSFT 158.15, +0.77, +0.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1824.06, +34.85, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1349.56, +6.00, +0.5%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.58, +1.00, +0.7%), and Facebook (FB 207.08, +1.96, +1.0%) to name a few.Amazon is a stock in the news, as it reported having a record-breaking holiday season. On a related note, MasterCard Spending Pulse said retail sales, excluding autos, were up 3.4% year-over-year for November 1 through December 24.Overall, today's news has been limited, which isn't unusual for the day after Christmas when many market participants and non-participants alike remain on holiday.The stock market, therefore, is still riding on positive sentiment that has been sustained in the absence of any negative news shocks, a seeming promise from the Fed that it won't be raising rates anytime soon, and an easing of trade tension between the U.S and China.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.5%; the S&P 500 is up 0.3%; the Dow Jones industrial Average is up 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is flat.10:46AWK American Water Works subsidiary Illinois American Water acquires Granite City wastewater collection system for $18 mln (122.29 +0.67)Illinois American Water, a subsidiary of American Water, has entered into an agreement with Granite City to acquire the City's wastewater collection assets. The agreement for the sale of the wastewater collection system, which serves 12,500 customer connections, is for $18 mln. The company expects to close the transaction in late 2020.10:43XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (125.04 +0.50)The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is today's second-best performing group, trailing only the energy sector (+0.7%). The sector is now up 0.5% for the week versus a 0.4% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500.Today's outperformance is being driven by relative strength in a handful of retailers after Mastercard SpendingPulse reported that holiday retail sales grew 3.4% yr/yr while online sales surged 18.8% yr/yr. These growth rates are likely a bit more optimistic than what will be shown by final results, considering that UPS (UPS 118.77, +0.44, +0.4%) expects to process a record 1.9 mln returns on January 2. This would translate to yr/yr growth of 26.0%.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 45.79, +0.07, +0.2%) touched an eight-month high before narrowing its gain to 0.2%, which underscores the fact that only some retail stocks trade with big gains.Notable movers:Amazon (AMZN 1821.26, +32.05, +1.8%): leading sector component, returning to its 200-day moving average (1824.51) after record-breaking holiday sales. Ralph Lauren (RL 118.11, +0.46, +0.4%): set a fresh six-month high today. Under Armour (UA 19.45, +0.05, +0.2%): trading at its best level since the start of August. Marriot (MAR 152.28, +0.78, +0.5%): trading at a fresh record. CarMax (KMX 88.03, -0.83, -0.9%): weakest sector component, falling to its lowest level since early October after reporting mixed results last week.10:29OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:CRWD Weekly Dec27 50 calls are seeing interest with 2720 contracts trading vs. open int of 120, pushing implied vol up around 20 points to ~67%.

Trump says China is not "giving the size" in negotiationsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 21, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 413 wordsBodyUS President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he is considering exempting Apple's products from tariffs on imports from China and showed himself pessimistic about trade negotiations with the Asian giant, considering Beijing he's not "giving the size" in the conversations.Trump pronounced himself this way during a visit with Apple President Tim Cook to a plant in Austin, Texas that has just begun manufacturing the new Mac Pro desktop computer, after the Californian company canceled its plan to move the assembly of that china."We're thinking about that," Trump responded, questioning the possibility of issuing an exception for Apple's products."We have to treat Apple in a way at least a little like how we treat Samsung," which is not affected by tariffs because it is based in South Korea, the president added.Trump gave several signs of tuning with Cook, who has been pushing for months for the White House to exempt Apple's iPhones and computers, whose production chain is closely related to the Asian giant for years, from its tariffs on China."He's told me we have the strongest economy in the world," Trump said of Cook, which he asked to repeat.The Trump administration has already released a dozen Apple components from 15% tariffs on $112 billion worth of Chinese imports that came into effect in September, nearly two years after the trade war with China began.However, the iPhones, AirPods and Apple wristwatches, which are among the most valued products by consumers, could be affected by the upcoming 10% to 15% tariff hike, which will take effect on December 15 if Trump doesn't stop it.Trump was skeptical today about negotiations with China, insisting that the Chinese government has "much more interest in reaching an agreement" than he is."I don't think they're doing the cut-off at the level I want," he replied as asked why he doesn't have such an interest in an agreement.Trump planned to sign a "first phase" of a "first phase" of a deal with China last weekend to contain the trade war with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but the cancellation of the APEC summit, to be held in Chile, left those negotiations in the air.The White House initially indicated that the agreement would be signed on the same deadline, but there is still no date or venue for the meeting between Trump and Xi.The Us representative has shown signs of pessimism this week, and on Tuesday warned that if he does not reach an agreement with China, "tariffs will rise even higher."Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

TikTok admits that it hid disabled users' videos appearing on the app's main feed, claiming the 'blunt' policy was used prevent bullyingBusiness Insider USDecember 3, 2019 Tuesday 01:33 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 761 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Rosie Perper)Highlight: TikTok admitted that it previously had a policy in place which limited the reach of videos posted by disabled users on the site.BodyXanderSt/Shutterstock• Viral video app TikTok admitted it previously had a policy in place which limited the reach of videos posted by disabled users on the site. • German tech blog Netzpolitik first reported on the moderation policy on Monday, saying the company on some occasions hid videos from users who are "susceptible to harassment or cyberbullying based on their physical or mental condition" from its main feed. • TikTok in a statement said the "blunt and temporary policy" was "never designed to be a long-term solution" and is no longer in place. • Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Viral video app TikTok admitted it previously had a policy in place which limited the reach of videos posted by disabled users on the site, claiming that the "blunt and temporary policy" was aimed at curbing bullying. German tech blog Netzpolitik first reported on the policy on Monday, citing leaked documents that it obtained from TikTok which outlined its former moderation guidelines, as well as interviews with a source at TikTok with knowledge of the policies. According to the Netzpolitik, TikTok's moderation guidelines laid out rules for "Imagery depicting a subject highly vulnerable to cyberbullying." It went on to describe users covered under the policy as people who are "susceptible to harassment or cyberbullying based on their physical or mental condition."It listed examples which included facial disfigurements, autism, and Down Syndrome, as revealed by screenshots of the policy. According to Netzpolitik, TikTok's moderation guidelines limited the visibility of content produced by those users, and people on the app who had disabilities were categorized as "Risk 4," meaning their videos were only visible in the country where it was uploaded. Some users who were deemed by moderators to be particularly vulnerable had their videos hidden from the app's main "For You" feed if they exceeded a certain number of views, which further limited the video's reach. The policy was in place until at least September 2019, according to the report. TikTok admitted to using the policy but said it was "never designed to be a long-term solution." "Early on, in response to an increase in bullying on the app, we implemented a blunt and temporary policy," a spokesperson for TikTok said in a statement."This was never designed to be a long-term solution, but rather a way to help manage a troubling trend. While the intention was good, the approach was wrong and we have since changed the earlier policy in favour of more nuanced anti-bullying policies and in-app protections. We continue to grow our teams and capacity and refine and improve our policies, in our ongoing commitment to providing a safe and positive environment for our users."TikTok has come under fire in recent weeks for its moderation policies after it suspended the account of US teenager Feroza Aziz, who posted a viral video on the app disguised as a makeup tutorial. The video criticized the Chinese government's treatment of Uighur Muslims in China's western autonomous region of Xinjiang.The company claimed that the suspension of Aziz's account was due to "human error", then issued a lengthy public apology before reinstating her account. In a statement to Business Insider in response to the controversy, TikTok said it "took a blunt approach to minimizing conflict" in its early moderation policies. "A previous version of our moderation guidelines allowed penalties to be given for things like content that promotes conflict between religious sects or ethnic groups, spanning a number of regions around the world. The old guidelines in question are outdated and no longer in use."A report compiled by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute last month also alleged that ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, is working closely with China's government to            facilitate human rights abuses against Uighurs through its Chinese apps, an allegation the company denies. NOW WATCH: 8 weird robots NASA wants to send to spaceSee Also:• How to delete your TikTok account permanently using the app• TikTok suspended a teen who posted a viral takedown of China disguised as a makeup tutorial, but it claims it's because she posted a video of Osama bin Laden• The wildly popular TikTok app is becoming an unlikely place for women to talk about infertility and reproductive health - and it's a clear sign the platform is for more than just teensSEE ALSO: Report claims TikTok parent company ByteDance is working with China's Communist Party to spread propaganda on XinjiangLoad-Date: December 3, 2019End of Document

ByteDance is now under investigation a well for its $1 billion acquisition of another popular app, Musical.ly.Last month, USA army cadets were instructed not to useTikTok, after Senator Chuck Schumer raised security concerns about the army usingTikTok in their recruiting.

The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.Some hesitation may be attributed to a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, Eunice Yoon, saying a government source told her that the trade mood in Beijing has turned pessimistic due to President Trump not backing any tariff rollbacks. The tweet has contended with Chinese state media indicating that Phase One talks were constructive over the weekend.From an equity-index level, the strong resistance to any sort of pullback remains indicative of an expectation for some sort of an agreement. Investors remain inclined toward stocks, but money is flowing into the more defensive-oriented sectors like the S&P 500 consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.The energy sector (-1.4%) is today's outright laggard amid a decline in oil prices ($56.78/bbl, -$0.94, -1.6%). The industrials sector (-0.5%) is under broad-based selling pressure, too.Separately, Apple (AAPL 266.47, +0.70, +0.3%) continues to grind out new all-time highs.In corporate news, Netflix (NFLX 304.18, +9.15, +3.1%) shares are seeing increased demand on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have taken a large stake in the company. HP Inc. (HPQ 19.92, -0.26, -1.3%) rejected the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 38.94, unch), although it remains open to a deal.U.S. Treasuries are benefiting from a conservative mindset today. The uptick in demand has the benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.75.Today's lone economic report was the NAHB Housing Market Index for November, which declined to 70 from 71 in October.12:33SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (92) outpacing new lows (56) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AGEN, AIZ, ALLE, AMAT, AMD, AMED, AMH, ANSS, APD, ARNC, ARVN, ATEC, ATRS, AUDC, AY, BIO, BIP, BRX, BURL, CATM, CDE, CDW, CG, CNMD, CNNE, CODI, CPRT, CZR, DAR, DEI, DGII, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, EPRT, EW, FISV, FIVN, FTNT, GLPI, GOOGL, GPN, GWRE, HIBB, INMD, INST, KEYS, KIM, KMX, KOD, KRG, KRYS, LDOS, LPT, LULU, LW, LXP, LZB, MDT, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NUVA, OC, ORLY, PCTY, PLMR, PLUG, PLXS, PODD, PPL, PSN, QGEN, RH, SEM, SGEN, SHOO, SKX, SRC, STX, TDG, TGI, TNK, TYL, UI, WD, WSM, XPEL, ZBH, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AMC, AR, BSM, BTU, CDEV, CHK, CNK, CPS, CTMX, CVEO, CYCN, DLPH, ECOL, ELVT, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXTN, EZPW, FET, FOSL, FPRX, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, HCC, I, IIVI, KLXE, KWR, MRKR, NBLX, NEWM, NVEE, PBT, PNNT, PSNL, QUAD, RARE, RBBN, RES, RVLV, SDRL, SIGA, SINA, SXC, SYRS, TH, TTI, TUP, UAN, UPWK, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CNXN, FWONA, KRTX, LACQ, NVMI, NWPX, PLOWThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CLXT, CMCT, NSCO, RDI, SRRK, TRCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: DIA, EIS, EWC, EWK, EWN, EWQ, IHI, IOO, IWF, IYH, IYK, NIB, OEF, PBD, SPY, VTI, XLK, XLP, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX12:07SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (DRNA) rises on collaboration agreement -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersDRNA (22.26 +15.34%): Co and Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced an agreement to develop therapies for liver-related cardio-metabolic diseases using co's proprietary GalXC RNAi platform technology, with plans to explore more than 30 liver cell targets.

Through the Lyft partnership, Gett's corporate customers traveling in the United States will be able to request rides through the Gett app and be matched with a driver on the Lyft network. This partnership will allow Gett to expand its reach across the United States, seamlessly serving its business clients on the Lyft network, all through Gett's SaaS platform for business travelers.Juno is shutting down in New York today as a result of both Gett's increased focus on the corporate transportation sector and the enactment of misguided regulations in New York City earlier this year. All Juno riders will be invited to join Lyft.11:16TALKX Market Briefing: Market checks up on tweet checkThus far, there hasn't been any follow-through on Friday's record-setting advance for the major indices, which are sporting modest losses.There is a bit of a hesitation/defensive trade mindset at work today after China-based CNBC anchor Eunice Yoon tweeted earlier this morning that a government source has told her that the mood in Beijing about a trade deal is pessimistic because President Trump hasn't endorsed any tariff rollbacks.This tweet conflicted with some of Friday's optimism, which was based on NEC Director Kudlow's indication that the two sides were getting close to an agreement and were down to the "short strokes."The fact that today's losses are far more modest that Friday's gains underscores an otherwise sticky belief that a deal of some kind will be reached; however, history on these matters dictates allowing some room for disappointment. Buyers, therefore, aren't rushing back into today's action, but knowing this market has refused to buckle on any negative-sounding news, is keeping the selling efforts in check as well.Currently, the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+1.0%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.7%) sectors are winning standouts, while the energy (-1.4%), industrials (-0.5%), and financial (-0.3%) sectors bring up the rear.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.5%.10:58XLP Sector Briefing: Bond Proxies (61.89 +0.56)The early portion of today's session has seen losses in most sectors, but there are some pockets of relative strength, as rate-sensitive consumer staples (+0.9%), utilities (+0.9%), and real estate (+0.7%) trade with solid gains.The three sectors account for just 14.0% of the entire S&P 500, so they have a limited impact on the overall performance of the market, but today's outperformance is largely due to one common factor: falling interest rates.Treasury yields backed down from three-month highs during the past week and they have already dipped beneath last week's lows today. Today's pressure on yields comes after a CNBC reporter in Beijing tweeted that the Chinese government has a pessimistic view of trade negotiations with the U.S., according to government sources.The continued pressure on Treasury yields means that high-yielding sectors like utilities, real estate, and consumer staples are becoming more attractive to investors.Notable movers:Consumer staples: Coty (COTY 12.18, +0.27, +2.3%), Kimberly-Clark (KMB 133.91, +2.28, +1.7%), Colgate-Palmolive (CL 67.50, +1.13, +1.7%), Walmart (WMT 120.52, +1.65, +1.4%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.00, +1.46, +1.2%). Utilities: Eversource Energy (ES 82.58, +1.31, +1.6%), NextEra Energy (NEE 234.20, +2.78, +1.2%), American Electric Power (AEP 90.79, +1.23, +1.4%), CMS Energy (CMS 61.63, +0.73, +1.2%), and Evergy (EVRG 65.53, +0.78, +1.2%). Real estate: Realty Income (O 78.68, +1.22, +1.6%), Equinix (EQIX 558.00, +7.59, +1.4%), Crown Castle International (CCI 136.38, +1.70, +1.3%), Welltower (WELL 85.13, +1.14, +1.4%), Healthpeak Properties (PEAK 34.97, +0.52, +1.5%).10:54ECONX President Trump tweets confirmation of 'cordial' meeting with Fed Chair Powell (311.75 -0.04)Tweet10:37ECONX Fed Chair Powell met with with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump this morning; he reiterated his monetary policy outlook, which will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economyAt the President's invitation, Chair Powell met with the President and the Treasury Secretary Monday morning at the White House to discuss the economy, growth, employment and inflation.Chair Powell's comments were consistent with his remarks at his congressional hearings last week. He did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economy.Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective and non-political analysis.10:31OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:LOW Weekly Nov22 120 calls are seeing interest with 1300 contracts trading vs. open int of 110, pushing implied vol up around 18 points to ~79%.

In ORION-9, twice-yearly dosing (following initial and three-month doses) with inclisiran sodium 300 mg met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, was well-tolerated and demonstrated an excellent safety profile. Full study results were presented during a late-breaking science session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions in Philadelphia.For the primary endpoints of ORION-9, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 50% (71 mg/dL, p<0.0001) at day 510 in HeFH patients and demonstrated time-averaged placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 45% (63 mg/dL, p<0.0001) from days 90 through 540. The overall adverse event profiles of the placebo- and inclisiran-treated groups in ORION-9 were similar. At least one serious treatment emergent adverse event was experienced by 13.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group and 7.5% of patients in the inclisiran-treated group. The incidences of deaths (0.4% vs. 0.4%) and malignancies (1.3% vs. 0.8%) were similar between the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively. Low incidences of clinically significant elevations in liver function tests (ALT 0.4% vs. 1.2%, AST 0.4% vs. 0.8%) and serum creatinine increases (0.4% vs. 0.4%) were observed in the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively, and none were considered related to study drug. Clinically relevant adverse events at the injection site, predominantly mild and always transient, were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients vs. 13.7% of inclisiran-treated patients.09:02SSTK Shutterstock appoints Jarrod Yahes as CFO, effective December 9 (42.19 )Since October 2016, Mr. Yahes has served as the Chief Financial Officer at Zeta Global, a marketing technology company.09:01CYTK Cytokinetics and Amgen (AMGN) present results from COSMIC-HF (8.18 )Amgen, Cytokinetics, and Servier announced that new results from COSMIC-HF (Chronic Oral Study of Myosin Activation to Increase Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 2 trial evaluating omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), will be presented today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2019. In patients with HFrEF treated with omecamtiv mecarbil, in addition to previously reported improvements in cardiac contractility measures (including systolic function, or pumping action of the heart), measures of diastolic function were not different from placebo and, for some measures, trended towards improvement. In COSMIC-HF, 448 patients with stable, symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% were randomly assigned to omecamtiv mecarbil or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 20 weeks. This post-hoc analysis assessed the effect of chronic therapy with omecamtiv mecarbil by treatment group on echocardiographic measures of diastolic function, including early (E-wave) and late (A-wave) peak mitral inflow velocities, early peak myocardial relaxation velocity (e'), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV), and diastolic filling time. In patients with HFrEF who received omecamtiv mecarbil, systolic ejection time increased as previously reported and expected, while diastolic filling time was not reduced, nor were diastolic parameters worsened. Specifically, in patients receiving omecamtiv mecarbil E-wave velocity, E/A-ratio, and E/e' or e' were not significantly changed compared to placebo. There was a small increase (<5 ms) in the duration of the IVRT, and in the PK group, TRV, an indicator of pulmonary pressure, improved significantly during treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil therapy.09:01OSTK Overstock.com declares regular annual cash dividend for 2019 of $0.16 per share on the company's Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock and of $0.16 per share on its Voting Series B Preferred Stock (8.33 )08:51LH Laboratory Corp commences senior notes offering (171.55 )LabCorp intends to use proceeds for general corporate purposes that may include (1) the purchase, redemption, or repayment at maturity of its outstanding 2.625% Senior Notes due Feb. 1, 2020, (2) the purchase of up to $300 mln aggregate purchase price of its 4.625% Senior Notes, due November 15, 2020 in a concurrent tender offer, and (3) the repayment of some or all of the amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facilities.08:50LOV Spark Networks appoints Eric Eichmann as CEO (5.59 )Eric will replace Jeronimo Folgueira who is stepping down from the role as chief executive officer.

In reaching this determination, the Board also considered the highly conditional and uncertain nature of the proposal, including the potential impact of outsized debt levels on the combined company's stock. We have great confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute to continue driving sustainable long-term value at HP. In addition, the Board and management team continue to take actions to enhance shareholder value including the deployment of our strong balance sheet for increased repurchases of our significantly undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A. We recognize the potential benefits of consolidation, and we are open to exploring whether there is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential combination with Xerox. However, as we have previously shared in connection with our prior requests for diligence, we have fundamental questions that need to be addressed in our diligence of Xerox. We note the decline of Xerox's revenue from $10.2 billion to $9.2 billion (on a trailing 12-month basis) since June 2018, which raises significant questions for us regarding the trajectory of your business and future prospects. In addition, we believe it is critical to engage in a rigorous analysis of the achievable synergies from a potential combination. With substantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox, we believe that we can quickly evaluate the merits of a potential transaction."06:03DRNA Dicerna Pharmaceuticals and Novo Nordisk (NVO) announce agreement to discover and develop novel therapies for the treatment of liver-related cardio-metabolic diseases using Dicerna's proprietary GalXC RNAi platform technology.

A statistically significant reduction in the secondary endpoints of PANSS-Positive and PANSS-Negative scores were also observed (p<0.001).KarXT was well tolerated in the Phase 2 trial, with similar discontinuation rates between KarXT (20%) and placebo (21%). The number of discontinuations due to treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) were equal in the KarXT and placebo arms (N=2 in each group)."With this information, and following our anticipated end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the second quarter of 2020, we will work to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of KarXT in patients with schizophrenia by the end of 2020. We also plan to further analyze these results to better understand the potential of KarXT in patients with schizophrenia experiencing negative and cognitive symptoms, and to explore other CNS disorders that could benefit from this approach, such as psychosis in Alzheimer's disease as well as the management of pain."06:00LN LINE Corp confirms agreement to form capital alliance with Z Holdings (48.13 )Line Statement06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets get a small boost from China's surprise rate cutThe global equity markets are mostly higher to begin the week. China had a lot to do with the strength after state media reports suggested Phase One talks have been constructive over the weekend. Also, the PBOC announced a key interest rate cut. This has supported markets and put US futures into all-time high territory. The S&P is just off the high of 3127.75, trading around 3124. This is well off the overnight low of 3113.75.In Asia, China took the spotlight with the news out of the region. The PBOC's rate cut of its seven-day repurchase rate, took it down to 2.50% from 2.55%. The move was unexpected. This helped the Shanghai gain 0.6% on Monday and essentially get all of Friday's losses back. Hong Kong managed to bounce over 1% after suffering heavy losses last week. Japan quietly rose 0.5%. European markets saw a small pop early but have settled back in since. Although most of the trading has been lackluster, mining stocks are among the weakest groups with Gold, Silver and Platinum down in the range of 0.7-1.3%. Copper has not followed metals lower, likely due to the rate cut in China.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +4.010 yr Note: 1.84%USD/JPY: 109.05 +0.30EUR/USD: 1.1064 +0.0015Europe: FTSE +0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng +1.4% Shanghai +0.6% Nikkei +0.5%Gold (1458.50 -10.00) Silver (16.75 -0.20) Crude (57.77 +0.05)17:05WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: CLVS (6.38 +77.96%), AMRN (24.02 +43.23%), COLL (18.12 +40.97%), SGRY (11.77 +35.6%), QGEN (40.56 +32.59%), DXCM (208.37 +32.47%), EPZM (15.36 +29.62%)Industrials: BE (6.53 +95.51%), TGI (28.49 +29.79%), MAXR (11.5 +28.49%)Information Technology: LASR (20.62 +46.24%), SYNA (60.37 +34.04%), COMM (14.95 +32.18%), DXC (37.23 +31.23%), CARB (22.95 +28.86%)Financials: TRUP (32.35 +36.21%), LTS (3.48 +32.82%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ANAB (11.1 -71.29%)Industrials: AFI (3.73 -41.26%), NSP (72.9 -32.29%)Consumer Discretionary: PRTY (1.89 -66.61%), MOD (7.54 -34.94%), EXPE (95.67 -30.57%)Information Technology: RBBN (2.75 -38.82%), PLT (26.22 -35.39%)Energy: EXTN (7.56 -41.89%), GLOG (9.64 -31.58%)17:01MGI Moneygram provides restructuring update (2.68 +0.06)On November 11, 2019, the co committed to an operational plan to reduce overall operating expenses - expects to complete the workforce reduction by the end of the first quarter of 2020.

The S&P 500 (+0.8%) closed above the 3100 level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%) closed above 28,000 -- both for the first time.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.7%) also closed at a record high, while the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) continued to trail its large-cap peers.The S&P 500 health care sector did the heavy lifting on Friday, climbing 2.2%, even as the Trump administration announced an initiative to increase price transparency from hospitals and insurers. Investors were evidently unconcerned about the proposal leading to an adverse effect on earnings.No other S&P 500 sector increased 1.0%, but the continued outperformance of Apple (AAPL 265.76, +3.12, +1.2%), Microsoft (MSFT 149.97, +1.91, +1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1334.87, +23.41, +1.8%) should not be understated. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.86, +0.44, +1.0%) and Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.9%) also showed relative strength.Retail stocks extended yesterday's advance after October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Semiconductor stocks benefited from the trade news and the solid results and guidance from Applied Materials (AMAT 62.06, +5.10, +9.0%). Conservative guidance from NVIDIA (NVDA 204.19, -5.60, -2.7%) did limit gains, though.Interestingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout on Friday.Separately, T-Mobile US (TMUS 78.07, +1.23, +1.6%) CEO John Legere is no longer considering the CEO role at WeWork, according to CNBC. Shares of RH (RH 188.47, +13.25, +7.6%) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY 38.95, +1.19, +3.2%) outperformed after Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B 219.74, +0.38, +0.2%) disclosed new positions in the companies.U.S. Treasuries didn't sell off despite the risk-on mentality in the stock market, but they did edge lower. The 2-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.99. WTI crude rose 0.9%, or $0.99, to $57.75/bbl.Reviewing Friday's batch of economic data:October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) following an unrevised 0.3% decline in September. Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) after declining an unrevised 0.1% decline in September.The key takeaway from the report, other than it shows continued growth in discretionary spending, is that it will be a positive input for Q4 GDP. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline, building materials, and food services and drinking places sales, and which factor into the goods component of the PCE calculation, were up 0.3%.Import prices for October were down 0.5%. Excluding fuel, they were down 0.2%. Export prices were down 0.1%. Excluding agricultural products, they were down 0.3%.The key takeaway from the report is that it points to an indolent inflation backdrop.Industrial production slumped 0.8% in October (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.3% decline (from -0.4%) in September. The capacity utilization rate fell to 76.7% (Briefing.com consensus 77.1%) from 77.5% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that, while the GM strike had a big impact on industrial production, things were still weak excluding that impact. To wit, the Federal Reserve reports industrial production declined 0.5% excluding motor vehicles and parts.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) after a downwardly revised 0.1% decline (from 0.0%) in August. Total business sales were down 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.1% increase (from 0.2%) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+3.7%) and sales growth (+0.5%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.Looking ahead, investors will receive Net Long-Term TIC Flows for September on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.7% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTD16:02PJC Piper Jaffray authorizes $150 mln common stock repurchase program (76.25 +0.61)Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 18, 2019End of Document

There's a nervous-sounding headline about the state of trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, the market dips on that headline, and then it bounces back.In turn, the gains are not material. They are modest, but nonetheless, they have kept the major indices on a record-setting course.Currently, the S&P 500 is up just 0.1%, which is just about its high for the session. The move there has seen a subsidence of the outperformance of defensive-oriented areas, like utilities (+0.4%) and consumer stales (+0.6%), and the ascendance of the growth-oriented sectors, like communication services (+0.5%) and information technology (+0.4%).There hasn't been a news catalyst for this performance shift; rather, it is indicative of a market that is playing with a bullish bias and riding a trading trend until it no longer proves to be a friend.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are up 0.1%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.14:00OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:PTON Jan20 35 calls (volume: 11300, open int: 760, implied vol: ~62%, prev day implied vol: 51%).

The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.Some hesitation may be attributed to a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, Eunice Yoon, saying a government source told her that the trade mood in Beijing has turned pessimistic due to President Trump not backing any tariff rollbacks. The tweet has contended with Chinese state media indicating that Phase One talks were constructive over the weekend.From an equity-index level, the strong resistance to any sort of pullback remains indicative of an expectation for some sort of an agreement. Investors remain inclined toward stocks, but money is flowing into the more defensive-oriented sectors like the S&P 500 consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.The energy sector (-1.4%) is today's outright laggard amid a decline in oil prices ($56.78/bbl, -$0.94, -1.6%). The industrials sector (-0.5%) is under broad-based selling pressure, too.Separately, Apple (AAPL 266.47, +0.70, +0.3%) continues to grind out new all-time highs.In corporate news, Netflix (NFLX 304.18, +9.15, +3.1%) shares are seeing increased demand on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have taken a large stake in the company.

Buyers, therefore, aren't rushing back into today's action, but knowing this market has refused to buckle on any negative-sounding news, is keeping the selling efforts in check as well.Currently, the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+1.0%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.7%) sectors are winning standouts, while the energy (-1.4%), industrials (-0.5%), and financial (-0.3%) sectors bring up the rear.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.5%.10:58XLP Sector Briefing: Bond Proxies (61.89 +0.56)The early portion of today's session has seen losses in most sectors, but there are some pockets of relative strength, as rate-sensitive consumer staples (+0.9%), utilities (+0.9%), and real estate (+0.7%) trade with solid gains.The three sectors account for just 14.0% of the entire S&P 500, so they have a limited impact on the overall performance of the market, but today's outperformance is largely due to one common factor: falling interest rates.Treasury yields backed down from three-month highs during the past week and they have already dipped beneath last week's lows today. Today's pressure on yields comes after a CNBC reporter in Beijing tweeted that the Chinese government has a pessimistic view of trade negotiations with the U.S., according to government sources.The continued pressure on Treasury yields means that high-yielding sectors like utilities, real estate, and consumer staples are becoming more attractive to investors.Notable movers:Consumer staples: Coty (COTY 12.18, +0.27, +2.3%), Kimberly-Clark (KMB 133.91, +2.28, +1.7%), Colgate-Palmolive (CL 67.50, +1.13, +1.7%), Walmart (WMT 120.52, +1.65, +1.4%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.00, +1.46, +1.2%)Utilities: Eversource Energy (ES 82.58, +1.31, +1.6%), NextEra Energy (NEE 234.20, +2.78, +1.2%), American Electric Power (AEP 90.79, +1.23, +1.4%), CMS Energy (CMS 61.63, +0.73, +1.2%), and Evergy (EVRG 65.53, +0.78, +1.2%)Real estate: Realty Income (O 78.68, +1.22, +1.6%), Equinix (EQIX 558.00, +7.59, +1.4%), Crown Castle International (CCI 136.38, +1.70, +1.3%), Welltower (WELL 85.13, +1.14, +1.4%), Healthpeak Properties (PEAK 34.97, +0.52, +1.5%)10:54ECONX President Trump tweets confirmation of 'cordial' meeting with Fed Chair Powell (311.75 -0.04)Tweet10:37ECONX Fed Chair Powell met with with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump this morning; he reiterated his monetary policy outlook, which will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economyAt the President's invitation, Chair Powell met with the President and the Treasury Secretary Monday morning at the White House to discuss the economy, growth, employment and inflation.Chair Powell's comments were consistent with his remarks at his congressional hearings last week. He did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economy.Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective and non-political analysis.10:31OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:LOW Weekly Nov22 120 calls are seeing interest with 1300 contracts trading vs. open int of 110, pushing implied vol up around 18 points to ~79%.

In ORION-9, twice-yearly dosing (following initial and three-month doses) with inclisiran sodium 300 mg met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, was well-tolerated and demonstrated an excellent safety profile. Full study results were presented during a late-breaking science session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions in Philadelphia.For the primary endpoints of ORION-9, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 50% (71 mg/dL, p<0.0001) at day 510 in HeFH patients and demonstrated time-averaged placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 45% (63 mg/dL, p<0.0001) from days 90 through 540. The overall adverse event profiles of the placebo- and inclisiran-treated groups in ORION-9 were similar. At least one serious treatment emergent adverse event was experienced by 13.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group and 7.5% of patients in the inclisiran-treated group. The incidences of deaths (0.4% vs. 0.4%) and malignancies (1.3% vs. 0.8%) were similar between the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively. Low incidences of clinically significant elevations in liver function tests (ALT 0.4% vs. 1.2%, AST 0.4% vs. 0.8%) and serum creatinine increases (0.4% vs. 0.4%) were observed in the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively, and none were considered related to study drug. Clinically relevant adverse events at the injection site, predominantly mild and always transient, were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients vs. 13.7% of inclisiran-treated patients.09:02SSTK Shutterstock appoints Jarrod Yahes as CFO, effective December 9 (42.19 )Since October 2016, Mr. Yahes has served as the Chief Financial Officer at Zeta Global, a marketing technology company.09:01CYTK Cytokinetics and Amgen (AMGN) present results from COSMIC-HF (8.18 )Amgen, Cytokinetics, and Servier announced that new results from COSMIC-HF (Chronic Oral Study of Myosin Activation to Increase Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 2 trial evaluating omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), will be presented today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2019. In patients with HFrEF treated with omecamtiv mecarbil, in addition to previously reported improvements in cardiac contractility measures (including systolic function, or pumping action of the heart), measures of diastolic function were not different from placebo and, for some measures, trended towards improvement. In COSMIC-HF, 448 patients with stable, symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% were randomly assigned to omecamtiv mecarbil or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 20 weeks. This post-hoc analysis assessed the effect of chronic therapy with omecamtiv mecarbil by treatment group on echocardiographic measures of diastolic function, including early (E-wave) and late (A-wave) peak mitral inflow velocities, early peak myocardial relaxation velocity (e'), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV), and diastolic filling time. In patients with HFrEF who received omecamtiv mecarbil, systolic ejection time increased as previously reported and expected, while diastolic filling time was not reduced, nor were diastolic parameters worsened. Specifically, in patients receiving omecamtiv mecarbil E-wave velocity, E/A-ratio, and E/e' or e' were not significantly changed compared to placebo. There was a small increase (<5 ms) in the duration of the IVRT, and in the PK group, TRV, an indicator of pulmonary pressure, improved significantly during treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil therapy.09:01OSTK Overstock.com declares regular annual cash dividend for 2019 of $0.16 per share on the company's Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock and of $0.16 per share on its Voting Series B Preferred Stock (8.33 )08:51LH Laboratory Corp commences senior notes offering (171.55 )LabCorp intends to use proceeds for general corporate purposes that may include (1) the purchase, redemption, or repayment at maturity of its outstanding 2.625% Senior Notes due Feb. 1, 2020, (2) the purchase of up to $300 mln aggregate purchase price of its 4.625% Senior Notes, due November 15, 2020 in a concurrent tender offer, and (3) the repayment of some or all of the amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facilities.08:50LOV Spark Networks appoints Eric Eichmann as CEO (5.59 )Eric will replace Jeronimo Folgueira who is stepping down from the role as chief executive officer.

This has supported markets and put US futures into all-time high territory. The S&P is just off the high of 3127.75, trading around 3124. This is well off the overnight low of 3113.75.In Asia, China took the spotlight with the news out of the region. The PBOC's rate cut of its seven-day repurchase rate, took it down to 2.50% from 2.55%. The move was unexpected. This helped the Shanghai gain 0.6% on Monday and essentially get all of Friday's losses back. Hong Kong managed to bounce over 1% after suffering heavy losses last week. Japan quietly rose 0.5%. European markets saw a small pop early but have settled back in since. Although most of the trading has been lackluster, mining stocks are among the weakest groups with Gold, Silver and Platinum down in the range of 0.7-1.3%. Copper has not followed metals lower, likely due to the rate cut in China.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +4.010 yr Note: 1.84%USD/JPY: 109.05 +0.30EUR/USD: 1.1064 +0.0015Europe: FTSE +0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng +1.4% Shanghai +0.6% Nikkei +0.5%Gold (1458.50 -10.00) Silver (16.75 -0.20) Crude (57.77 +0.05)17:05WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: CLVS (6.38 +77.96%), AMRN (24.02 +43.23%), COLL (18.12 +40.97%), SGRY (11.77 +35.6%), QGEN (40.56 +32.59%), DXCM (208.37 +32.47%), EPZM (15.36 +29.62%)Industrials: BE (6.53 +95.51%), TGI (28.49 +29.79%), MAXR (11.5 +28.49%)Information Technology: LASR (20.62 +46.24%), SYNA (60.37 +34.04%), COMM (14.95 +32.18%), DXC (37.23 +31.23%), CARB (22.95 +28.86%)Financials: TRUP (32.35 +36.21%), LTS (3.48 +32.82%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ANAB (11.1 -71.29%)Industrials: AFI (3.73 -41.26%), NSP (72.9 -32.29%)Consumer Discretionary: PRTY (1.89 -66.61%), MOD (7.54 -34.94%), EXPE (95.67 -30.57%)Information Technology: RBBN (2.75 -38.82%), PLT (26.22 -35.39%)Energy: EXTN (7.56 -41.89%), GLOG (9.64 -31.58%)17:01MGI Moneygram provides restructuring update (2.68 +0.06)On November 11, 2019, the co committed to an operational plan to reduce overall operating expenses - expects to complete the workforce reduction by the end of the first quarter of 2020.

The S&P 500 (+0.8%) closed above the 3100 level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%) closed above 28,000 -- both for the first time.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.7%) also closed at a record high, while the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) continued to trail its large-cap peers.The S&P 500 health care sector did the heavy lifting on Friday, climbing 2.2%, even as the Trump administration announced an initiative to increase price transparency from hospitals and insurers. Investors were evidently unconcerned about the proposal leading to an adverse effect on earnings.No other S&P 500 sector increased 1.0%, but the continued outperformance of Apple (AAPL 265.76, +3.12, +1.2%), Microsoft (MSFT 149.97, +1.91, +1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1334.87, +23.41, +1.8%) should not be understated. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.86, +0.44, +1.0%) and Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.9%) also showed relative strength.Retail stocks extended yesterday's advance after October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Semiconductor stocks benefited from the trade news and the solid results and guidance from Applied Materials (AMAT 62.06, +5.10, +9.0%). Conservative guidance from NVIDIA (NVDA 204.19, -5.60, -2.7%) did limit gains, though.Interestingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout on Friday.Separately, T-Mobile US (TMUS 78.07, +1.23, +1.6%) CEO John Legere is no longer considering the CEO role at WeWork, according to CNBC. Shares of RH (RH 188.47, +13.25, +7.6%) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY 38.95, +1.19, +3.2%) outperformed after Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B 219.74, +0.38, +0.2%) disclosed new positions in the companies.U.S. Treasuries didn't sell off despite the risk-on mentality in the stock market, but they did edge lower. The 2-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.99.

Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) after declining an unrevised 0.1% decline in September.The key takeaway from the report, other than it shows continued growth in discretionary spending, is that it will be a positive input for Q4 GDP. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline, building materials, and food services and drinking places sales, and which factor into the goods component of the PCE calculation, were up 0.3%.Import prices for October were down 0.5%. Excluding fuel, they were down 0.2%. Export prices were down 0.1%. Excluding agricultural products, they were down 0.3%.The key takeaway from the report is that it points to an indolent inflation backdrop.Industrial production slumped 0.8% in October (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.3% decline (from -0.4%) in September. The capacity utilization rate fell to 76.7% (Briefing.com consensus 77.1%) from 77.5% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that, while the GM strike had a big impact on industrial production, things were still weak excluding that impact. To wit, the Federal Reserve reports industrial production declined 0.5% excluding motor vehicles and parts.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) after a downwardly revised 0.1% decline (from 0.0%) in August. Total business sales were down 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.1% increase (from 0.2%) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+3.7%) and sales growth (+0.5%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.Looking ahead, investors will receive Net Long-Term TIC Flows for September on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.7% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTD16:02PJC Piper Jaffray authorizes $150 mln common stock repurchase program (76.25 +0.61)Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 18, 2019End of Document

Global stocks sink after Trump threatens more China tariffsAssociated Press InternationalNovember 13, 2019 Wednesday 12:48 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 479 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Global stocks sank Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened more tariff hikes on Chinese imports if talks aimed at ending a trade war fail to produce an interim agreement.Market benchmarks in London, Frankfurt, Shanghai and Tokyo declined. Wall Street looked set to slip.Trump said Tuesday that an agreement on the "Phase 1" deal announced last month "could happen soon." But he warned he was ready to raise tariffs "very substantially" if that fails.The two sides disagree publicly about whether the U.S. agreed to roll back some punitive tariffs imposed in the fight over Beijing's trade surplus and technology ambitions. The Chinese government said last week that was settled, but Trump denied that.Trump's comments "served as a reminder of the challenge that the two sides face," said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. However, she said, investors saw them as "positioning statements," reducing their impact.In midday trading, London's FTSE 100 declined 0.5% to 7,331 and Frankfurt's DAX lost 0.7% to 13,186. France's CAC 40 shed 0.4% to 5,894. On Wall Street, futures for the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were each down 0.4%.In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3% to 2,905.24 and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 sank 0.9% to 23,319.87. Hong Kong's Hang Seng tumbled 1.8% to 26,571.46.South Korea's Kospi retreated 0.9% to 2,122.45 and Australia's S&P-ASX 200 sank 0.8% at 6,698.40. India's Sensex lost 0.3% to 40,215.20.Hong Kong shares, already under pressure from the U.S.-China tariff war and slowing global demand, have been jolted by growing violence in anti-government protests.The protests began in June over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include demands for greater democracy and other grievances. Hong Kong tumbled into its first recession in a decade in the latest quarter.Momentum for the global stock market has been mostly upward for more than five weeks as worries about the U.S.-China trade war have eased.This week, the U.S. Labor Department is due to give updates on consumer and wholesale inflation. Economists expect a government report to show retail sales returned to growth in October.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to give testimony to Congress on Wednesday about the U.S. economy. Most investors expect the Fed to keep interest rates on hold for now after cutting them three times since the summer.ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 37 cents to $56.43 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 6 cents on Tuesday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 60 cents to $61.46 per barrel in London. It retreated 12 cents the previous session.CURRENCY: The dollar fell to 108.84 Japanese yen from 109.01 yen. The euro dipped to $1.1006 from $1.1010.___Matt Ott in Washington contributed to this report.Load-Date: November 14, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei: "Spain's 5G network is going to be the best in Europe"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 11, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1540 wordsBodyThere's little left of that mountain man who was doing more than 600 kilometers every day to go to school. From the grandson of a cook and the son of teachers he entered as a soldier in the People's Liberation Army of China and ended up building a chemical fiber factory. From the engineer who raised with his hands a modest communication equipment maintenance operator who transformed into a telecommunications giant.If you ask Ren Zhengfei (75 years old, Zhenning, China) what he does, he will answer that he is a creator. But the good ones. You have to be to start a company with $3,500 and, 32 years later, have more than 100 billion revenue.Having the HUAWEI CEO in front of it is a candy that for the first time a group of Spanish media have been able to taste. Even more so when we consider the current context: 5G implementation, trade war between China and the United States, fight for global technological supremacy, accusations of espionage... And the peasant-turned-emperor of Chinese nets does not tip without thread. Let's start with the papers on the table of a large room in the J-5 block of Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen city.The Spanish Ministry of Defence has advised its officials to enter its intranet with Huawei devices. I would like to clarify that we are not aware of the veto of the Ministry of Defence and have not received any official notification from the Spanish Government on this matter. Nothing has stopped our supply of services to Spain, which is a great country because it conquered the world. In colonial times he drew a line on the planet. History has left us to Spain as the first world power to ascend. And with our 5G technology base, Spanish culture can also reach everyone. Is Spain losing its trust in Huawei? I don't think I'm losing confidence. We have to study the facts. The 5G network in Spain is going to be the best in Europe, an example for the whole old continent. How to clear suspicions that the Chinese government is behind Huawei? Would the IPO be an option? Huawei is a company born on Chinese soil and has to comply with the law of this country. Also, as an international company, it has to respect the laws of the countries in which it operates. That is why I can say that Huawei is a company that complies with all the laws of the countries where it is present. The sample is our results, the stocks we take, not necessarily the public listing on the Stock Exchange. Can a Chinese company be completely independent of the Government and the Communist Party? Yes. In China we can be absolutely independent. Chinese law has given us this status. Isn't it contradictory that Huawei leads 5G in a country like China, famous for its control and censorship that slows down the internet and forces vpn to use? We just provide the equipment and that doesn't have much to do with internet control. It's a more car-and-highway relationship. We build the highways, which have nothing to do with cars. It's not contradictory at all. But before we build the highways we have to take into account the demand and the current situation. Is a kind of digital Berlin Wall being created between the US and China that will technologically divide the world? I don't think this wall will come true, because the Berlin Wall has to do with hard force. Today we are in a digital world without walls separating us. Moreover, if that were to come true, the two-block separation of the world would be inopportune for the United States. American technology companies are the best, the world leaders. If they are unable to market their products and services, they will result in large losses and their resultsfinancial institutions will be worse. In addition, there would be other companies in the other bloc that would replace those in the United States. Are you aware that Huawei is in the midst of a fight for global technological supremacy? Who will win in the end? I don't understand why the United States and China entered a trade war. I don't know if the person who uncovered this war is sorry now. And if you have the confidence that your country is going to win. We have sale 0 in the United States. I don't care. You have in mind the company to move to a closed system if we go towards a 100% Chinese Huawei ecosystem with no presence of applications coming from the Unidos.No states will be so. Because of the conflicts with the Americans we have an interim measure that is to use our own pieces, but it is a temporary action, because we are convinced that this is going to end and we are going to embrace globalization. The new operating system is not only for smartphones, but also for all digital devices of our company. What is your backup plan if relations with the United States deteriorate further? Huawei is a very poor company. And we don't have as large a reserve of funds as American companies. But without being not as rich as they have been able to develop our own processors. Not only the central processor, but also chips for artificial intelligence. We've been preparing for over 10 years. Without Google we can continue to offer our customers the best technological solutions. But we don't exclude American partners. We continue to buy the parts from American companies in large quantities. We are very committed to globalization.The globalization of countries like Spain too? Artificial intelligence is going to create so much wealth to spread it out to everyone. We will have fully autonomous farms in the future. Also autonomous ports without any human intervention. In the future, Spanish pork will be exported much more to China by improving the trade flow between the two countries. Spain is also one of the countries with the best quality of education worldwide. We Chinese have to learn from Spain to improve our educational quality. Spain, on the other hand, now suffers from a trade deficit with China, but with cooperation we can reverse this situation. An example is at the telecommunications summit in Barcelona (Mobile World Congress) which is held every year and that we always go to. I really like to walk around Barcelona and stop in front of Gaudí's buildings. The charm of Spain is felt in the streets. When I return to China I always tell my friends that our country is getting rich, but to reach countries like Spain in charm and culture we would need many more years. Does Huawei plan to continue collaborating with Telefónica in other countries where it operates, in addition to Spain, in Latin American countries? Telefónica has our full support for the deployment of our network throughout Latin America.What does NATO think has defined China as a threat? NATO really sees China as a constructive partner, not a rival. Between NATO and China, we have no conflicts of interest or political problems. And 5G is a part of development, not harm. In any case, I believe that these views will not affect our development in Europe. Is Huawei's technology helping the Government's control of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang? Should Huawei have a moral code to know what use is given to its technology in these places where several reports suggest that there are re-education camps for this minority? If Spain makes a car, the company cannot determine which hands it ends in. If the car crashes into a wall, it's the faultDriver. We can't sell a car and a qualified driver at the same time... The United States also sells its weapons to Middle Eastern governments... doesn't that give arguments to the United States in the accusations against Huawei saying it's not a company that has good practice? The United States is not in a position to criticize others. As a parent, how do you feel a year after your daughter's arrest, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada and how do you deal with the legal process? Have you been to visit her? I haven't visited her yet, her mother's accompanying her in Canada. It hasn't affected me that much. Are you afraid to be stopped like her if you visit other countries? I'm not afraid I'll be stopped. There is much controversy in China over the case of his former employee Li Hongyuan, the man who was detained for 251 days after the company accused him of extortion after seeking compensation when he was fired. He has now been acquitttttttted by the courts. On social media and state newspapers, they have spoken of Huawei's loss of that "patriotic love" it received from the people after the US veto. Is Li Hongyuan's case damaging Huawei's image in China after the patriotic wave? I'd like to say it's not a labor litigation. If you've been in jail for many days, it's because you've committed a crime. If he thinks he's innocent, he can turn to legal channels to denounce the company. But I don't think some critics hurt us that much either. A few months ago, with America's veto, we were the star on social media. Critics help cool the atmosphere a little. In fact, when Chinese citizens think we are perfect, they have to know that we have a lot of difficulties. What motivates you to continue to lead your company despite the war with the United States? I already wanted to retire, but the president of the United States hit me so hard that that has made me continue to work for the company, especially for the PR part.       Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

Beijing denounces New York Times' decision to publish leaked Xinjiang documentsCNN.comNovember 18, 2019 Monday 2:34 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 596 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyThe Chinese government has reacted furiously to the publication of more than 400 pages of sensitive Communist Party documents by the New York Times, which linked President Xi Jinping to the country's mass detention centers in the far western region of Xinjiang.The documents, which were published by the New York Times on Saturday, represent one of the largest ever data leaks from inside the Chinese government. Their disclosure provides a rare window into the secretive policy decisions around the continued mass incarceration of religious and ethnic minorities.According to the US State Department up to 2 million mostly-Mulism Uyghurs as well as other minority groups have been detained without due process in detention camps, a system described by former detainees as designed to eradicate their language and cultural heritage.The Chinese government initially denied the camps' existence but now says they are voluntary vocational training centers, part of a region-wide program designed to curb Islamic extremism.But the internal party documents published by the Times showed there was clear discussion about the mass detention of Muslim minorities, with one top official ordering his staff to "round up everyone who should be rounded up."The documents also linked the campaign back to President Xi through previously unpublished speeches he made to local officials in 2014, calling for "absolutely no mercy" in a crackdown on "terrorism ... and separatism."Xi made the speech just days after a terrorist attack in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi in April 2014. The far western Chinese region has a long history of unrest and protests, including a 2009 police crackdown which spiraled into citywide violence in Urumqi.According to the Times, the documents were leaked by a "member of the Chinese political establishment" who wanted to make sure Xi and other senior party official didn't escape culpability for the policy.Speaking at his daily press conference Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang did not deny the documents were real but did accuse Times' reporters of willful misinterpretation."It (the Times) used clumsy patchwork and distortion to hype up the so-called 'internal documents' and smear China's counter-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts. What are they up to?" he said.Geng said that the country's de-radicalization efforts had been a major success."Xinjiang affairs are purely China's domestic affairs. The issue Xinjiang faces is not about ethnicity, religion or human rights ... Thanks to the preventive counter-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts, Xinjiang ... hasn't seen a single violent, terrorist incident over the past three years," he said.The Xinjiang regional government said the New York Times article was "entirely fabricated by domestic and foreign hostile forces" and "full of lies.""The western anti-China forces ... don't want to see the stability and harmonious development of Xinjiang, and have constantly fabricated fake news to attack and smear Xinjiang," the statement said.The leaked documents said that a number of party officials were purged for disagreeing with the campaign or attempting to release Uyghur detainees.Beijing's vast network of detention centers in Xinjiang have been widely criticized across the Western world, with 23 countries including the United States and Australia issuing a statement condemning them in late October.But there has been even broader support for the Chinese government in other parts of the world, with 54 countries signing a counter statement praising the Xinjiang program.Load-Date: November 20, 2019End of Document

Key findings in secret documents on China's detention campsAssociated Press InternationalNovember 25, 2019 Monday 9:30 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 357 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyThe Chinese government has detained more than a million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities for what it calls voluntary job training. But a newly revealed classified blueprint shows that the camps Beijing runs in China's far west are instead forced ideological and behavioral re-education centers, run in secret.The documents were linked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by an anonymous source and independently verified. Here are some of their key revelations:- What Beijing calls voluntary job training centers are actually forced political re-education camps. "Vocational training" is conducted only after detainees are released from the centers, in separate facilities.- Officials are ordered to "prevent escapes" by installing guard towers, double-locked doors, alarms, blanket video surveillance and police stations at the front gates. Guards monitor detainees 24 hours a day, and even toilet breaks are strictly managed.- The camps are directly linked to mass surveillance apparatus in the far Western Xinjiang region. A centralized digital system identifies tens of thousands of targets for questioning and potential detention, pioneering a new form of social control using data and artificial intelligence.- Individuals are targeted for questioning and potential detention because of what is considered suspicious behavior, which includes going abroad, asking others to pray or using cell phone apps that cannot be monitored by the government.- Detainees are given scores on everything from how they speak Mandarin to whether they adhere to a strict set of rules governing everything down to bathing and going to the toilet. The scores are fed into an elaborate point system that helps determine if they are eventually permitted to leave or punished.- Detainees are to be kept for a minimum of one year in the centers. Independent Chinese legal experts say this is a violation of China's own laws because it exceeds legal maximum detention times for people who are not formally charged and sentenced for a crime.___See more on the China Cables here: https://apnews.com/4ab0b341a4ec4e648423f2ec47ea5c47Load-Date: November 26, 2019End of Document

This DSMB recommendation marks the seventh review with no safety signals that would justify modification or discontinuation of the study, including review of safety data from patients in the study who have received elafibranor for as long as three years. This most recent DSMB recommendation supports that elafibranor is generally safe and well tolerated in completed and ongoing clinical studies, which is critical for drug candidates that are aimed to treat chronic diseases such as NASH or PBC. Top-line interim results from the Phase 3, RESOLVE-IT trial, based on the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis, are expected to be announced in Q1 2020. If positive, GENFIT aims to file a new drug application with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency by the end of 2020. Elafibranor has received fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment of NASH. If approved, elafibranor could be the first approved therapy for resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis.06:09MOMO Momo beats by $0.08, beats on revs; guides Q4 revs above consensus (38.48 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.69 per share, $0.08 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.61; revenues rose 16.2% year/year to $622.8 mln vs the $604.37 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Nonetheless, the S&P is currently trading about a point lower around 3132. This is slightly off the overnight low of 3128.00.In Asia, the Nikkei made a 52-week high, while the Shanghai was flat.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

Zimeta is the first and only FDA-approved medication for the control of pyrexia in horses.16:05ACAD ACADIA Pharmaceuticals announced positive top-line results from its ADVANCE study, will initiate second pivotal study in the first half of 2020 (47.76 +0.68)The co announced positive top-line results from its ADVANCE study, a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 403 patients. ADVANCE evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjunctive pimavanserin treatment in patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia who have achieved adequate control of positive symptoms with their existing antipsychotic treatment. No drug is approved by the FDA for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.Pimavanserin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement on the study's primary endpoint, the change from baseline to week 26 on the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 (NSA-16) total score, compared to placebo (-10.4 vs. -8.5; p=0.043; effect size = 0.21). A greater improvement in the NSA-16 total score compared to placebo was observed in the 53.8% of patients (n=107) who received the highest pimavanserin dose of 34 mg (-11.6 vs. -8.5; unadjusted p=0.0065, effect size = 0.34). In this study, pimavanserin did not separate from placebo on the key secondary endpoint, the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale.ACADIA plans to commence a second pivotal study with the 34 mg dose of pimavanserin in the first half of 2020.

REMARKS BY SECRETARY ESPER AT NATIONAL SECURITY COMMISSION ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PUBLIC CONFERENCEStates News ServiceNovember 5, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 4538 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the United States Army:SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK T. ESPER: Well, everybody settled down. We've still got conversations going on, huh. Must be some good issues out there.Good afternoon, and thank you, Katharina, for that introduction.You know, the work this commission is doing in bringing together academia, defense and business is critically important.I'm going to scooch around here because I can't see over here.So thank you for inviting me to speak today. It's really great to be here. The world around us is changing at a pace faster than ever before. New technologies are emerging that are fundamentally altering how we think about, plan and prepare for war.Twenty-eight years ago I saw firsthand the transformative power of technology during Operation Desert Storm. As some of you know, I was a young infantry officer with the 101st Airborne Division. I took part in what became the deepest air assault into enemy territory at that point in history. And in only 96 hours, the 101st moved three brigades over 350 miles, cutting off the Republican Guard.The Gulf War was the proving ground for a new generation of military weapons and equipment, from laser-guided smart bombs to stealth aircraft, to the first widespread use of GPS.By liberating Kuwait and defeating the Iraqi military in a matter of days, American forces demonstrated our mastery of the digital revolution, and rendered what was then cutting-edge Soviet technology obsolete.Our adversaries took note. And since then they've been trying to catch up.Five years ago they surprised the world with how far they'd come. On July 11, 2014, Ukrainian forces assembled about five miles from the Russian border in southeastern Ukraine. Coming off recent successes against Russian-backed forces, the Ukrainian battalions were eagerly preparing a final push to the border. Suddenly they noticed the hum of Russian UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] overhead, followed by cyberattacks against their command and control and communication systems immediately, after a flurry of Russian artillery rained down on then. The whole episode lasted just a few minutes, but it inflicted tremendous damage. Dozens of soldiers were killed, hundreds more were wounded; most of their armored vehicles were destroyed. The Ukrainian offensive came to a devastating halt, all in a matter of minutes.The world was quickly awakened to a new era of warfare advanced by the Russians. It's clear the threats of tomorrow are no longer the ones we have faced and defeated in the past. That is why our National Defense Strategy hinges on the ability of our forces to adapt to a security environment characterized by new threats from our strategic adversaries.We are committed to making the investments necessary to accelerate our innovation in technologies that will help us stay ahead of the curve, especially artificial intelligence. Advances in AI have the potential to change the character of warfare for generations to come. Whichever nation harnesses AI first will have a decisive advantage on the battlefield for many, many years. We have to get there first.Future wars will be fought not just on the land and in the sea, as they have for thousands of years, or in the air, as they have for the past century, but also in outer space and cyberspace, in unprecedented ways. AI has the potential to transform warfare in all of these domains.The NDS remains the department's guidepost as we adapt the force to this new environment. The NDS prioritizes China first and Russia second as we transition into this era of great power competition. Beijing has made it abundantly clear that it intends to be the world leader in AI by 2030.President Xi has said that China must, quote, "ensure that our country marches in the front ranks when it comes to theoretical research and this important area of AI and occupies the high ground in critical and core AI technologies."For instance, improvements in AI enable more capable and cost-effective autonomous vehicles. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is moving aggressively to deploy them across many warfighting domains. While the U.S. faces a mighty task in transitioning the world's most advanced military to new AI-enabled systems, China believes it can leapfrog our current technology and go straight to the next generation.In addition to developing conventional systems, for example, Beijing is investing in low cost, long-range, autonomous and unmanned submarines, which it believes can be a cost-effective counter to American naval power.As we speak, the Chinese government is already exporting some of the most advanced military aerial drones to the Middle East, as it prepares to export its next generation stealth UAVs when those come online.In addition, Chinese weapons manufacturers are selling drones advertised as capable of full autonomy, including the ability to conduct lethal targeted strikes.There's also ample evidence that China's developing and deploying AI to strengthen its authoritarian grip over its people. All signs point to the construction of a 21st century surveillance state designed to censor speech and deny basic human rights on an unprecedented scale.Look no further than its use of surveillance to systematically repress more than a million Muslim Uyghurs. Beijing has all the power and tools it needs to coerce Chinese industry and academia into supporting its government led efforts.Equally troubling are the outside firms, or multinational corporations, that are inadvertently or tacitly providing the technology or research behind China's unethical use of AI.Cooperation with Beijing has consequences, not just for democracy and human rights but also for the strength of our partnerships abroad.If our allies and partners turn to Chinese 5G platforms, for example, it will inject serious risk into our communication and intelligence sharing capabilities. Our collective security must not be diminished by a short and narrow sighted focus on economic opportunity.Russia has made its intentions equally clear, calling AI the future of humanitari of humanity and describing the technology as the key to supremacy on the world stage. Moscow has already demonstrated its eagerness to use the latest technologies against democratic nations and the ideals of free and open societies. We shouldn't doubt their abilities on the battlefield, either.I mentioned the Ukraine example earlier and we expect Russia to continue to deploy increasingly high tech AI capabilities in current and future combat zones. The United States, on the other hand, will offer a vision of AI that upholds American values and protects our fundamental belief in liberty and human rights.We will harness the potential of AI to create a force fit for our time. We believe there's tremendous opportunity to enhance a wide range of the department's capabilities, from the back office to the front line, and we will do this while being recognized as the world leader in military ethics by developing principles for using AI in a lawful and ethical manner.In line with the NDS, we stood up the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, the JAIC. Its role is to integrate the power of AI across the many levels of the Department of Defense. Not only are we doing this in areas such as predictive maintenance and cyber defense, but also with more complex applications, like joint warfighting.We don't approach AI, or any technology for that matter, as a panacea. We also see it as a tool to free up valuable resources and manpower so our war fighters and our operators can focus on higher priority tasks in a more efficient and more effective manner.Our ultimate goal is to get the war fighter into the cloud. We must be able to pool our vast streams of data and deliver AI capability out to the tactical edge. This will require the wholesale commitment to modernizing our warfighting systems, cultivating a premiere workforce, and strengthening our partnership across the entire sector. We recognize these challenges, and we are committed to addressing them.Our success is also contingent upon predictable, adequate and timely funding from Congress. The ongoing continuing resolution harms military readiness and impacts our ability to accelerate AI development at the speed and scale necessary to stay ahead. Our adversaries are not slowing down, and the United States cannot afford to, either. Congress must understand that short-term budget uncertainty has long-term strategic implications for our nation's security.Now while technology is constantly changing, our commitment to the law, to ethics and to duty does not. The department's history clearly demonstrates our ability to invest in, develop and deploy systems that reduce risk to our war fighters while increasing our combat effectiveness for the ultimate purpose of protecting the security of the American people. We will ensure that we develop this technology in ways that uphold our values and advance security, peace and stability at the same time.Some in the private sector have raised concerns about working on AI with the United States military. Unlike some parts of the world, American corporations have a choice in who they work with. That is the virtue of our free enterprise system.But let me be be clear, the question is not where I AI will be used by militaries around the world; it will be. The real question is whether we let authoritarian governments dominate AI, and by extension the battlefield, or whether industry, the United States military and our partners can work together to lead the world in responsible AI research and application.When America unleashes its collective genius of industry and government and academia, there is no one that can compete with us. I saw this firsthand in the Gulf War and our history is rife with other examples. During World War II, the titans of industry and hard-working patriots answered the call and transformed Detroit into the arsenal of democracy. After the Sputnik launch, we rallied our best and brightest, we created DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] and NASA and we took control of the space race. Mastering AI will require similar vision, ambition and commitment.You and I are no stranger to these sorts of challenges. America has risen to the task before and we must do so again, but we need your help. We need the full force of American intellect and ingenuity, working in harmony across the public and private sectors. We need your leadership and your vision to ensure we maintain a strategic edge, and we need forums and commissions such as these to pioneer solutions that will deter aggression and provide for our collective security.Thank you for your time and I look forward to our discussion. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)KATHARINA MCFARLAND: Thank you, Secretary, for the thoughtful remarks. It's clear that you and the department have been thinking about AI and what it offers to our military. Also, how it could be enabling our adversaries who may not share our values for our new and different (inaudible).So I'd like to pull upon some of your comments, and thank you so much for sharing with us. I'd like to understand how the DOD might be communicating with industry and challenging them to solve our most pressing national security issues.SEC. ESPER: Well we we're reaching out in a number of different ways, everything from the traditional way of posting notices and RFPs [request for proposals] and things like that, to forums, to for a, to think tank sessions, to reaching out to academics directly, if you will.You and I were talking beforehand. When I was secretary of the Army, we stood up the AI Task Force at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and I I spent a whole day out there working with some of the researchers and many of our industry partners that showed up for the for the groundbreaking.So we're trying to reach out at a number of different levels. We need to reach out with regard to industry and not not just to the the big players on the block, but all the way down to the small innovators. That's where you tend to find your greatest innovation, your ingenuity, and we need to make sure we do it comprehensively.We we we've got to tap the best and brightest from across the country, again from all of those different sectors, and make sure we can we can get to the end state quicker than the Chinese and the Russians can.MS. MCFARLAND: God bless you. I think those things are (Laughter.) we have had a lot of conversation about speed; and I think this is an important conversation to expand on; and I understand you just mentioned the think tanks, that you've had the Defense Innovative (Innovation) Board just come in and provide some recommended principles for the ethics, because it's not just speed, it's conforming to our values as a society.What are your thoughts about the DIB report, and have you had a chance to think about where these principles might be implemented across the department?SEC. ESPER: Sure; well, as I said in my remarks, we have to, as we always have, conduct ourselves ethically and legally and morally. And I was very pleased by what I saw in the DIB report; it just came out last week and it listed a set of principles.But in terms of going about and applying them to AI, it went back and reaffirmed the the same principles we applied to other systems that we've we've been using for many, many years. So I'm very pleased with the outcome of the report.For those of you who had a chance to look at it, I think it it it's very comprehensive, it balances out a number of different things, it talks about the the need for continued exploration of these topics to make sure we get it right. This is one we cannot afford to get wrong.MS. MCFARLAND: Yes and and one of the things that I'm very concerned about, and the commission has had a lot of dialogue about, which is our human resources, and how are we going to attract that talent and institutionalize it into the department.Have you had a chance to think about those concerns, and what you might be able to do to attract the right type of talent to be able to do this business in the future?SEC. ESPER: Yeah, I would say that, you know, with most things, talent is the key, is making sure you're you're able to access the best and the brightest. You've got to be able to recruit them and retain them and keep them happy and busy and, you know, we've faced the same challenge over the past many years with cyber.And I I saw this not just from the government perspective, where the Army built the, you know, Army Cyber and and started recruiting and retaining there, but also from the private sector, where we seem to all be we all being industry and government and the academia all competing for the same handful of people. And because the these are very talented, exceptional folks, and they they they have great opportunities to work in the private sector at for large sums of money and do those types of things.So what we have to do is make sure that we find different ways to attract them because we cannot compete with the private sector when it comes to compensation, but we can offer you the chance to serve your country, to do things that are very, very interesting, maybe do things that aren't legal in the private sector (laughter) and but exciting nonetheless. But it's it is a tremendous part. We we tend to bring together a a great deal of folks. And what I'll I've always enjoyed with my time in service, whether it's in the military or in DOD, you you've you work around a great group of people who are focused on something bigger than themselves, bigger than the bottom line, and you get committed to that.And again, I think it it it seems cliche all the time, but this is the space race. I mean, whoever gets there first is going to is going to dominate and we we got to set aside Sputnik; we largely got to space first with with what you needed and we dominated the heavens for for and still do.And we need to get there first on AI, and then maintain that lead, so it's going to be continuing investment. And so what we're trying to do now is make sure we leverage authorities that were given to us by Congress to to make sure we can bring in people, we can recruit them, we can use different techniques to bring them in mid-career, we can bring them in with a different compensation packages and whatnot.So we're we're looking for ways to get outside of our own bureaucratic methods to make sure we can balance all of these things out.MS. MCFARLAND: Super. It's so good that you come from a service background and roll up into this position. I think one of the things that we are seeing as a commission is the change of warfighting. And what do you see, now that you're in this position coming from the Army with all of its challenges in the AI battle now that you're in the secretary's position, what do you see that DOD is going to face in the future that's different with the way AI will implement?SEC. ESPER: Well you I I think I mentioned this from my remarks. AI won't change the nature of war, but it'll change the character of war, which which is which is a a major leap forward, if it can happen, and AI AI will transcend everything we do. So it's not just warfighting, but it's going to be predictive maintenance, which is one of the areas in the Army, at least, that we're trying to get AI involved immediately.You can think about what it does if you can really use AI to optimize your maintenance, you you get higher reliability rates, you get fewer breakdowns, you get better efficiency on the system, et cetera. But then there's the other end, the warfighting end, and we talk about speed and decision making.You know, these days, if you're I I wasn't in the armor; I was in the infantry, but I know a little bit about it, but you know, if you're a tank platoon leader or a tank commander, if you will, you're you've got people actually looking out on the battlefield and calling out the enemy enemy targets, if you will, enemy tanks, and you have sensors, too.But imagine a world, though, where you have AI integrating into all of your sensors and everything, where the AI is constantly scanning a horizon and it's immediately, within milliseconds, it's it's sorting out what is what's a what's a civilian truck and what's an enemy combatant vehicle, what's a tank and what's a fighting vehicle, which one has its turret pointed to you and which one doesn't, which one is your immediate threat?And it can do that so much quicker, it could slew your gun, and it just allows you so much greater reaction to the enemy; and you can and and then that's where the man in the loop comes to decide whether you pull the trigger or not.And that's how we've got to think about AI; enabling quicker, faster decisions that allow us to be successful on the battlefield and and and bring our folks home, too. And that's just a warfighting application. We can go toward anything. I mean, whether it's heck, if it's even doing audits of the DOD.MS. MCFARLAND: Yeah.SEC. ESPER: Which has never been done before.(Laughter.)We're getting there. But but everything. I mean, AI runs through everything we do and we've got to be able to make sure we get it get it. That's why we're trying to move as quickly as we can to the cloud.MS. MCFARLAND: Excellent. You mentioned during your preliminary notes here about your interest and your energy behind AI. And when you actually went through your confirmation hearing, you mentioned it as one of your highest priorities.SEC. ESPER: Yeah.MS. MCFARLAND: And you referred to the Joint Artificial Intelligence Commission Committee. What are your thoughts for the future, and how do you think your leadership will be able to top down, as well as bottom up draw our department past that bureaucracy that you're discussing into that future?SEC. ESPER: Yeah, well the you know, the acquisition system is not is not as efficient as it should be. We're ...MS. MCFARLAND: Yes, sir.SEC. ESPER: We're we're trying to take advantage of laws given to us, and authorities by Congress, but it's slow. And the biggest problem with DOD in terms of acquisition is is the culture, right? It's very risk adverse.So we've got to change the culture. That'll take time. You know, you change the laws first, then you change the regulations and the practices. And I think the services are moving forward on that at different rates. But we've got to empower the JAIC to to be able to cut through these things to make sure we get there quicker.Again, we're we're in a race, we have to get to the end state quicker than the Chinese can, quicker than the Russians can. And there are a few key technologies out there. I put AI at number one. You know, two, three and four look like directed energy, and hypersonics, and a few other things like that. But at even with those systems, whether it's hypersonics, directed energy, AI is still going to enable them in in terms of how you employ them, how you maintain them, all that. So that's why AI to me pops up as number one.MS. MCFARLAND: You mentioned in your conversations here the issue of bringing the best and brightest. Have you seen some good collaboration between the government, academia and industry? I recall or at least I seem to recall when I was working with you in the Army, there was some activities.Have you got some examples that we can bring to the forefront to get people past that risk equation?SEC. ESPER: Yeah, it's a good question. I I you know, I wish I had some at hand. I I mentioned before the we were we kicked off a AI Task Force at Carnegie Mellon University, and we're doing some good initial work there and had a a number of different players involved.Obviously, the Army is deeply integrated in Austin, Texas, with the Army Futures Command. They're doing a lot of work trying to cut through bureaucracy, get straight using the cross-functional teams to do that. But again, I think all of the services are looking for different ways where we can we can really accelerate the progress, because we need to get there, we need to make sufficient investments; and right now DOD is in the final weeks, if you will, as as you recall, of building its budget for the next year.And and again, AI is one of those core, critical technologies we need to get to; but but it's not just it's not just the money, it's the people. I probably put people number one, and then all of the systems that you need to enable them to do their jobs and do them well.MS. MCFARLAND: Yeah. You mentioned the talent and trying to recruit it. There's a pipeline, as you know, that you went and experienced, not just in the Army, but now in the broader context of DOD, where science and technology, early research and that investment is so important.What are your thoughts about the future in that investment and where do you think it might be needed in the department?SEC. ESPER: With regard to the on the personnel side?MS. MCFARLAND: Yes.SEC. ESPER: Well you know, the the biggest thing one of the biggest things we were pushing in the Army and and I'm confident that Secretary McCarthy and and and Chief of Staff McConville still are, is talent management.It's you know, we had to overhaul the the personnel system ...MS. MCFARLAND: Yes.SEC. ESPER: ... because it was just holding us back in too many ways. And it's and that's just for the military side. You know, there's the the the civilian side, as well, that needs looked at, too. So, DOD does great work. We you know, we do a number of things really well, but when it comes to talent, we're still working in a industrial age system.MS. MCFARLAND: Yeah.SEC. ESPER: And it's you know, it's regulated by by by the Executive Branch; it's regulated by Congress; it has a number of constraints put on it. But we've got to get beyond that, and just be able to think outside the box, because again, at the end of the day, it's the talent.And it's not like we're we're in a non-competitive environment. We're competing against industry, we're competing against think tanks. All you know, these these folks are in high demand, and they're a a low density, at least, pool of talent at this point in time.MS. MCFARLAND: Yeah. And you have an opportunity here with this community, it's a mix of academic, it's a mix of civilian, et cetera. Is there anything that you would call for them to think about that would help you in your problem solving?SEC. ESPER: You know, I I I think the more that you can help us point out what are what are the obstacles we are putting in our own way, right? We have enough challenges out there external to us, exogenous. So how do we what do we need to do better, what are you seeing that I don't see?I I try every month to meet with with groups of CEOs or heads of associations and talk about what can we do better, how can we see ourselves better? Because typically, what I hear is everything is okay, everything is great, everything's green, no problem. But it when you reach out there, you go walk around and visit folks and talk to companies and talk to entrepreneurs, you get a different story.And we're trying to just beat those down one at a time as we as we realize, oh, we're not doing this well or we could if we make some adjustments to the system here, we could really up our talent. So we're looking at I'll I'll you know, we'll I'll take any problem and it allows us if it can allow us to do better or or, you know, ideas you have for us to perform, all those things help because this is too important ...MS. MCFARLAND: Thank you.SEC. ESPER: ... just to to treat as anything else.MS. MCFARLAND: Yeah. Sir, your remarks and your inputs have been excellent. Is there anything that you would like to share beyond what I've asked you? Is there any thoughts that you would like to have for our folks here?SEC. ESPER: No, I well, yes, I guess, I I I'll just keep foot stomping it, is DOD doesn't doesn't have the monopoly on great ideas here or or certainly all of the talent. So much of it is coming from the private sector.So we really need your help and and be cautious of of what's happening out there in the world. As as I like to tell our NATO allies and European friends and I was just in Brussels two weeks ago talking to the German Marshall Fund, on this topic, by the way. I tell them, 'don't don't write off what we're saying as United States scaremongering, or in this case DOD scaremongering about China. Don't think we're over overstating the problem.'There are serious issues out there, and we've been asleep at the switch now for quite some time/ And we're finally waking up here in the past couple of years. And the National Defense Strategy is what what has pointed DOD in the right direction, saying we're now now in an era of great power competition; China is our greatest strategic competitor number one; Russia number two. And we need to be prepared for high intensity conflict across five domains of warfare five domains, no longer three, and that's where we're headed, and and I we need to get your help to get there, so ...(CROSSTALK)MS. MCFARLAND: Thank you sir, so much, very much.SEC. ESPER: Thank you. Thank you.MS. MCFARLAND: Please, thank the secretary.(APPLAUSE)Load-Date: November 8, 2019End of Document

Both the U.S. and China continued to say over the weekend that a deal is near.The news is conflicting with a less-covered story from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal, whatever that may look like, may not be completed before the 2020 presidential election. The report may be receiving less attention because it was not based on comments from any top trade negotiators or high-ranking officials.10:25 ETDow +143.23 at 28018.76, Nasdaq +89.70 at 8609.58, S&P +18.87 at 3129.16[BRIEFING.COM] Both the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%) have set all-time highs today.In the health care space, The Medicines Co.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

Consumer Technology Association Issues Statement on Phase One Trade Deal With ChinaTargeted News ServiceDecember 13, 2019 Friday 9:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 383 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ARLINGTON, Virginia BodyThe Consumer Technology Association issued the following news release by President and CEO Gary Shapiro on the announcement of a phase one trade deal with China and Trump administration's decision to reduce existing tariffs and postpone List 4B tariffs on Chinese imports:"We applaud President Trump for making an initial deal with China that enforces fair trade practices and addresses critical tech priorities including intellectual property (IP) protections and forced technology transfer. It is a significant step toward ending this costly trade war. The partial tariff rollback is also welcome news."We look forward to learning more detail on the tariff removal and urge the White House to make those rollbacks quickly and permanently. Achieving IP and tech transfer concessions is important, and we also encourage the Chinese government to make needed their necessary changes transparently and swiftly."Tariffs are taxes on Americans - not the Chinese. The postponement of the next round of tariffs may temporarily protect American consumers from price increases on today's essential tech devices - including smartphones, laptops and tablets. But it doesn't resolve market uncertainty or return the billions of dollars our nation is already paying in tariffs. Businesses and markets crave certainty and a relief from the volatility caused by the ups and downs of our trade negotiations."Today's news is progress, and we urge Presidents Trump and Xi to continue these negotiations and reach full tariff removal as soon as possible--and that both sides will stop using tariffs as a weapon."According to new data from CTA, compiled and analyzed by The Trade Partnership, the U.S.-China trade war has cost consumer tech companies a total of $17.5 billion, including $1.6 billion in taxes for products critical to 5G deployment.* * *Consumer Technology Association:As North America's largest technology trade association, CTA(R) is the tech sector.

China tells gaming arcades to ban children outside school holidaysCNN WireNovember 22, 2019 Friday 9:34 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 478 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  China is taking steps to curb online gaming addiction by ordering arcades and computer cafes to deny access to minors outside public holidays.From January 2020, entertainment businesses should not allow minors to log on, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement posted on its website Wednesday."(This will) promote the healthy development of the industry and meet the growing needs of the people for a better life," the statement said.Enterprises that create gaming equipment are encouraged to tap into China's "traditional culture" and "actively promote the core socialist values," the statement added.Sun Lei, a senior consultant at Beijing's TA law firm, said a ban was already in place but it had rarely been enforced. He saw the announcement as a warning by Beijing that it is serious about addressing the problem."It is certainly a part of re-emphasis of the government on gaming addiction," he said. "But whether it will be effective is still unclear."In recent years, the Chinese government has sought to reverse what it sees as a growing trend of gaming addiction in people under 18. Earlier in November, it announced a curfew, banning gamers whose registered age is under 18 from playing online between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m..On weekdays, minors are only allowed to play up to 90 minutes, and up to three hours during weekends and holidays.Sun said it was not clear whether the law could be enforced, given the number of machines that would have to be monitored."Even claw machines could come into the 'banned machines' category. But how can the machine operators supervise their huge amounts of machines all over the country and make sure no kids will play them?" he said.World's largest gaming marketChina is the world's largest gaming market, worth tens of billions of dollars and accounting for a quarter of global revenue, according to market research firm Newzoo.Young people gather to play games -- either in groups or alone -- at hundreds of computer cafes across China's major cities. Last year, a survey by China's Ministry of Education found that about 18% of the country's young people were "at risk" of developing a video game addiction.However, there is no official data on the prevalence of gaming addiction among internet users in China, according to state-run media.The rules on minors in gaming centers is the latest in a series of government measures to address gaming addiction.In 2018, Beijing said it would limit the number of new online games to "reduce nearsightedness in children and adolescents."The government has already implemented a registration system which would require people who play computer games to do so under their real names, allowing companies to check up on them.CNN's Jared Peng contributed to this article.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Greater China Secure Content Management Market Report 2018 & 2019-2023: Regulatory Compliance Continues to Drive the MarketPR NewswireDecember 3, 2019 Tuesday 9:45 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 744 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Dec. 3, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Analysis of the Greater China Secure Content Management Market, Forecast to 2023"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.Greater China was the second-largest SCM market and the fastest-growing in 2018. While the Web security segment experienced stronger growth, driven by rising concerns among enterprises to monitor threats posed by employees' use of the Internet, the e-mail security segment still remains a highly targeted attack vector due to the increasing complexity of the threat landscape.Over the next 5 years, enforcement of regulations, as mandated by the government, and innovation across key verticals, will drive market growth. The Chinese Government's introduction of Regulation on the Internet Security Supervision and Inspection by Public Security Organs will drive future security investments.Similarly, the Taiwanese Government introduced the Cybersecurity Management Regulation in 2018 to boost threat resilience. Moreover, the rapid progress of digitalization among key industries has contributed to the stronger dependence on information systems and will continue to drive investments in security to secure network information systems against vulnerabilities.Research ScopeThe study period is from 2019 to 2023, and the base year is 2018. SCM solutions are the key area of focus and they cover e-mail security and Web security. Vertical segmentation is as follows: government, banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI), service provider, manufacturing, education, and other sectors (pharmaceuticals, retail, logistics, oil and gas, energy, mining, agriculture, IT/ITES, and BPO). Horizontal segmentation covers large businesses and small and medium businesses.Important companies in the Greater China SCM market include SANGFOR, Symantec, QiAnXin, H3C, Trend Micro, Forcepoint, Softnext, Cisco (IronPort), and Cellopoint. The countries included in this study are Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China.Research HighlightsThe study highlights important market growth drivers and restraints. Key drivers include the constantly evolving risks that drive the need for e-mail and Web security solutions, the stringent security and privacy requirements that push organizations to invest in on-premise security solutions, and the need for productivity management that drives enterprises to invest in these solutions.Key Issues AddressedIs the SCM market growing? How long will it continue to grow and at what rate? What were the key market trends in 2018? What trends will gain importance in the future? What are the key market drivers and restraints? Which regions and countries were 2018's best performers? What does the competitive landscape in the Greater China market look like?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ON EAST ASIAN AND PACIFIC AFFAIRSStates News ServiceNovember 15, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 5205 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:*MODERATOR:* So I want you to know this is [Senior State Department Official]. Hes back from travels in the Far East and is going to start off with some remarks and then go into QandA. This will be treated on background, attribution to a senior State Department official, the whole thing. Okay?*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:* Should we distribute now or do you want*STAFF:* Yeah, sure. Its up to you.*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:* While shes passing that out, I just want to note that Ive been doing this for five months now and this is my fourth trip to the region. The trips are sometimes planned based on activity, like in this case the East Asia Summit and the Fuji Dialogue in Japan and other things, and other times are just part of a larger plan to be out visible and working a key region in the U.S. national security plan.So again, its a great place to be. Were handing out both the Indo-Pacific Strategy Report, which looks at how we've been doing so far, and we plan to continue to update you as much as possible, both in terms of press availability but also in documented ways such as this.One of my actually, my top priority is messaging and is getting the word out as clearly as possible to you, to the region, to whoever needs to hear it, rather than stay silent and allow people to guess or suggest what we might be thinking or doing. So thank you for coming and for the opportunity to, again, get the un-muddied word out.I want to read to you, just because it was six stops in two weeks and it really became a blur after a while, so Im just going to quickly cover the high points of each stop, and then we can go back for QandA on specifics.So Ill start off with the Mt. Fuji Dialogue in Tokyo, where I participated with a number of important folks. Former National Security Advisor McMaster was there at the Fuji Dialogue good chance to talk to him and interact. We also had very good discussions with senior Japanese leaders on the margins of that event.In all these meetings, I emphasized that the U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace, security, prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, and that the President is committed to working with Japan to jointly strengthen our ever-important alliance. We also discussed celebrating the 60th anniversary of the alliance in 2020.In trade, I emphasized that our recently signed trade agreement would help create jobs, expand investment, reduce our trade deficit, and promote fairness. We also spoke about cooperating with Japan on 5G and data security, and I emphasized that the new agreement on digital trade will expand vital digital trade between our countries.As far as the greater region, I thanked Japan for being such an important partner in the Indo-Pacific in economic matters, security, governance, and human capital.As far as North Korea, I reassured Japan that our commitment to defense of our allies is ironclad. I said that the United States remains prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation. I thanked Japan for being a strong ally in the pressure campaign against the DPRK through the implementation of UN sanctions, particularly in deterring ship-to-ship transfers of illicit coal and petroleum. I also told my interlocutors that we appreciate Japans hosting U.S. and allied aircraft on Okinawa for the Security Council resolution enforcement efforts.As far as Japan-ROK relations, I stressed that recent DPRK missile launches have highlighted the critical value of the ROK-Japan security cooperation and information sharing. I told them that when tensions arise between Japan and ROK, the only winners are Pyongyang, Moscow, and Beijing.From there, we spent about three days in Myanmar, in Burma. I met with senior government leaders in Nay Pyi Taw, including State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi. I traveled to an internally displaced personnel camp in the Rakhine State and heard directly from the Rohingya there. I met civil society leaders in Rangoon, and we discussed Burmas ongoing progress to a more peaceful and democratic country.In all these meetings, I reaffirmed the U.S. decades-long support for Burmas democratic transition and economic transformation. One thing I will take away from these trips is the enduring connection and sense of goodwill that exists between the people of Burma and the United States.In the capital Nay Pyi Taw, we frankly discussed some of the challenges our bilateral relationship faces and ways to move forward. Myanmar must work with the international community to improve the situation for the Rohingya and other ethnic minority groups and create the conditions for safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable return of displaced persons from within Burma and Bangladesh.In addition, we discussed ongoing violence in many parts of the country, to include Rakhine State, Shan State, Kachin State, the need to re-energize the national peace process, and the negative effect on civilians of all of this from all communities. Particularly distressing is the continuing lack of humanitarian access to displaced people in these areas. I stressed again the need for accountability for those responsible for serious human rights abuses.In the economic realm, we discussed areas for deepened engagement, including responsible investment and economic development. This can promote inclusive economic growth and better business practices. It can also help limit the militarys economic interests.Burma is heading into their second national elections in decades. We are the leading donor, contributing 24 million for the November 2020 elections as we continue our support for Burmas transition away from decades of isolation and military rule.During my conversations, I heard about the geopolitical challenges in the region. I told the partners that the U.S. will work with them to address complex national and regional challenges for the betterment of the people of Burma.In sum, my visit impressed upon me the significant challenges we face but also the opportunities for a better future if we can make progress together. As Burma leaves behind the dark days of military dictatorship, more and more people have a shot at a better future. And in that regard, this is not just a U.S. initiative. Weve got lots of support from partners in the region Japan, Korea, and others. Id be happy to discuss that.On to Kuala Lumpur, met with the foreign minister on the 31st of October where I reaffirmed our diverse partnership in trade, investment, security, educational, and cultural relations. On the same day, I made remarks at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia and was pleased to announce the recovery and anticipated return of approximately $1 billion in assets associated with the 1MDB corruption scheme, highlighting our ongoing successful law enforcement cooperation with Malaysia to combat corruption and help protect its national prosperity and sovereignty.On the 31st of October, I also met with Deputy Defense Minister Liew Chin Tong, noting the strength of our military-to-military relationship, evidenced by nine military exercises we held together hold together each year, the most Malaysia has with any country.We discussed the shared goal to improve Malaysias maritime capacity given that Malaysia is the largest recipient of funding from our Maritime Security Initiative. We also examined ways to expand exchange opportunities for Malaysian armed forces officers as we will be providing $1.5 million in IMET, International Military Education and Training, funding for Malaysia in FY20.As far as the Indo-Pacific strategy, on the 31st of October I met with Malaysian Investment and Development Authority Chairman Abdul Majid. I highlighted our focus on catalyzing investments in infrastructure, energy, and the digital economy through the Indo-Pacific. I urged high standards of transparency and financial sustainability as Malaysia reviews its infrastructure projects with China to ensure that Malaysia can attract high quality private-sector-led development while still preserving Malaysias sovereignty.On November 1st, I had a breakfast meeting with America Chamber of Commerce members, encouraged U.S. companies to continue embodying U.S. values as they invest in Malaysia noting that the U.S. is now the largest source of foreign investment in Malaysia with $2.8 billion U.S. of approved investments in the first half of 2019 alone.In my meetings with the foreign minister and the deputy defense minister, I noted Chinas Nine-Dash Line posed a direct threat to the freedom of seas and rules as well as the rules-based order. I reiterated that we were not seeking confrontation, but we have to challenge Chinas unlawful maritime claims.In my meetings with the foreign minister and the deputy defense minister, I held productive discussions on ways to effectively respond to human rights challenges in the Rakhine State and urged Malaysia to respect the principle of non-refoulement.From there, we moved to Bangkok for East Asia Summit and bilateral activities. This trip also provided important opportunity to provide or to further strengthen the U.S. relationship with Thailand, a key partner and a long-time ally in Asia. This is the third visit to Thailand this year in five months, demonstrating U.S. commitment to maintaining our enduring friendship with the Thai with Thailand and the Thai people. Bilateral meetings reinforced U.S. support for Thailands continued progress to uphold democratic institutions and human rights. Continued progress excuse me to uphold democratic institutions of human rights and fundamental freedoms is essential to our partnership with Thailand.I got to meet with members of the parliament again, showing that this democratic process is working their standing committee on legal affairs, justice, and human rights, and they welcome the diversity of opinions and voices in Thailands parliament. I appreciated the opportunity to meet these members, many of whom are holding elected office for the first time, as we discussed the important issues of law, justice, and human rights in Thailand.We also met with civil society there, as well as nongovernmental organizations, highlighting the opportunities and the challenges of their efforts. We discussed ideas for U.S. engagement with civil society throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and in our meetings with Thailands government, opposition parties, and civil society, we consistently message that democratic institutions must be strengthened, human rights and fundamental freedoms must be respected.I met with Permanent Secretary Busaya for the third time while I was there, congratulating Thailand on its successful chairmanship of ASEAN this year, which took on enormous amount of work, and also thanked Thailand for working so well with the U.S. Government and our business community to co-host the Indo-Pacific Business Forum on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit.As far as the East Asia Summit, Thailand was very successful in National Security Advisor OBrien, in acting as a special envoy to the President, he announced that the President is inviting ASEAN leaders to a special summit in the United States in 2020. In Bangkok, the National Security Advisor OBrien met with the leaders of Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, among others.Support for a strong united ASEAN remains at the heart of our Indo-Pacific strategy. We see great convergence with ASEANs outlook on the Indo-Pacific and our vision for the region and the visions of our allies and partners in championing transparency, inclusiveness, good governance, and respect for international law. Well spend some time on this stop because this was a we got a lot of work done in Bangkok.U.S. FDI in ASEAN is $271 billion, greater than our FDI in China and Japan combined. In Bangkok, we announced the start of negotiations to link the ASEAN Single Window with U.S. electronic customs systems, which will further facilitate $334 billion in annual two-way trade between the United States and ASEAN. So 271 billion in investment and 334 in two-way trade.On the security front, we discussed how Beijings coercive behavior in the South China Sea prevents ASEAN claimants from accessing oil, gas, and fisheries resources. U.S. security assistance to the Indo-Pacific was $1.3 billion over three years, much of that in Southeast Asia. Our inaugural ASEAN-U.S. maritime exercise and U.S.-ASEAN Cyber Policy Dialogue advanced our strategic partnership.In the world of human capital, our Young Southeast Asia Leadership Initiative, YSEALI, and the U.S.-ASEAN internship program continue to bring our people close together. We also launched ASEAN Innovation Circle to promote development through grassroots collaboration on the digital economy and entrepreneurship.So during on the sidelines of EAS, the Indo-Pacific Business Forum, cohosted by the Thais and we really appreciate their help on that it was a great success. We had some about a thousand business and government leaders attend from the U.S. and then from across the Indo-Pacific.On the U.S. side, we had Commerce Secretary Ross, Under Secretary of State Keith Krach, and leaders from USAID, OPIC, and Ex-Im banks, USTDA, Treasury, and other agencies. We also had 17 U.S. ambassadors and chiefs of mission come to Bangkok with delegations from their host countries. They advanced billions of dollars in new U.S. commercial deals.I encourage everyone to read the fact sheet that we provided on the Indo-Pacific Business Forum. Rather than read the data to you, you can get it from that. We also published a longer report on our Indo-Pacific strategy, which you also have, and things were doing with allies and partners in the region.Two stops to go Korea and then the PRC.In Korea, in Seoul, I enjoyed productive discussions with senior ROK leaders. In all of these meetings, I reaffirmed the alliance with the Republic of Korea. It continues to be the lynchpin of peace and security in the Indo-Pacific. As far as the ROK and Japan, in my meeting with senior ROK officials I stressed the importance of the GSOMIA to our collective security and urged ROK not to terminate this important information-sharing agreement. We discussed the importance of U.S.-ROK-Japan trilateral cooperation. While the U.S. will not mediate between our two key allies, I made clear that we will remain engaged and continue to urge the ROK and Japan to de-escalate tensions and find creative solutions to their differences. We will not mediate, but it does not mean that were not involved. I mean, I just had another meeting this morning the drumbeat has been steady to encourage both sides to find a path back to the productive relationship that they had.On economic relationship while I was in Seoul, I joined Under Secretary Keith Krach in meeting with Korean business leaders. Under Secretary Krach was in Seoul for the U.S.-ROK Senior Economic Dialogue, and I was pleased to see U.S.-ROK released a joint statement that reaffirmed the strength of our bilateral economic relationship and our commitment to continue expanding our robust economic cooperation and commercial ties.Besides these meetings in Seoul, I also enjoyed meeting my ROK counterpart on the margins of the East Asia Summit in Bangkok, where we released a joint factsheet highlighting U.S.-ROK cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. We discussed ways to enhance the U.S.-ROK bilateral relationship, including closer coordination between our Indo-Pacific strategy and Koreas New Southern Policy, which have many areas of overlap.Last stop was in Beijing. In Beijing I had a useful meeting with my counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang, and we discussed a wide range of issues. Underscored that we want to see a constructive, results-oriented relationship with the PRC, but that we need to see tangible progress on important issues. As Vice President Pence and Secretary Pompeo have done in recent speeches, I was very candid about the differences we have with the PRC Government, but were very open to cooperation where it is in our shared interests, in both sides interests.Regarding Hong Kong and Xinjiang, I also raised with them our concerns with Hong Kong and Xinjiang with Vice Minister Zheng Zeguang. Beijing must continue to exercise restraint in Hong Kong and act in accordance with its commitments in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Continuing to undermine Hong Kong autonomy would only inflame tensions.Likewise, regarding Xinjiang, I urged Beijing to respond to the growing concerns of the international community the repression of Muslim minorities.The topic of reciprocity, I discussed how it just reciprocity is essential to constructive relationships in any diplomatic relationship. President Trump has been very clear about this. He has said that reciprocity is his favorite word. So whether its the freedom of U.S. diplomats to do their jobs in China, or Beijing living up to its obligations to take back Chinese nationals that have been ordered for removal from the U.S., the U.S.-China relationship must operate on principles of reciprocity and fairness. I was happy to have the opportunity to underscore this with the vice foreign minister.On North Korea, I urged Beijing to maintain pressure on the regime, noting the space for a diplomatic solution is quickly closing and that Beijing must take action to prevent sanctions evasion that occurs in its jurisdiction, such as a failure to stop ship-to-ship transfers of coal and oil that takes place in Chinese waters.I have also urged Beijing to ensure that they meet the December 22nd UN-mandated deadline to repatriate the thousands of North Korean guest workers in China. These guest workers provide a valuable source of revenue for Pyongyang. This is not has not been reported widely in public, but these workers whether in China, Russia, the Middle East, or Africa are subject to terrible depravations that fall far short of international standards to protect workers.I raised the issue of fentanyl and the fentanyl crisis in the U.S., and encouraged greater PRC counter-narcotics enforcement, noting recent convictions by the Chinese Government. I pressed for full enforcement of the PRCs class scheduling of fentanyl. I gave Vice Foreign Minister Zheng a copy of a powerful recent article in The New York Times Magazine about the PRCs role in the U.S. fentanyl crisis, and I commend that article to you all to review. The article shows why this issue is an intense concern for the administration, the Congress, as well as U.S. public.Thank you for your patience.*QUESTION:* You need to take shorter trips. (Laughter.)*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:* Yeah, sorry. But again, I thought wed get it all out there upfront.*QUESTION:* Thats okay. That fentanyl story, that was the failing, fake news New York Times that you were*MODERATOR:* All right, Matt. Whats the question?*QUESTION:* talking to the Chinese about?I want to ask you about Korea and not is it correct that what the North Koreans have said today, that you guys want to resume talks next month? I mean, I know that you have been wanting to do it as soon as possible, but is it is that a target from your point of view? And then just on the U.S.-South Korea military alliance and the story that came out I guess last night about you wanting a 500 percent increase in what they pay, how is that the I mean, how is that the behavior of a good, close, and loyal ally?*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: *So on North Korea, I will happily defer to Special Representative Biegun on that one. My getting in the middle of that is unhelpful, and its not productive given the level of visibility on this subject. So I if yeah, please pass those questions to Steve Biegun.As far as the negotiations on the Special Measures Agreement, SMA, the point the administrations been making all along is that and my point has been that the relationship changes as the security dynamic in the region changes. Its linked to North Korea and others security risks and threats. We review these agreements over time and we update them in order to ensure that both sides are being treated this workload, this balance is being treated and addressed fairly. So as far as the details on the negotiation, it would be exceptionally, exceptionally stupid of me to weigh in on actual numbers and process, but I think you would all would understand that sharing the load is in both countries interest, to make sure the relationship stays balanced and*QUESTION: *Well*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: * self-respect or respectful.*QUESTION:* Yeah, but well*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:* Okay. Good.*QUESTION: *You mentioned Hong Kong, and you said you had stressed the importance to Beijing of exercising restraint. What have you told them would be the consequences of not exercising restraint if they were to send in PLA units or Peoples Armed Police units? How would the U.S. respond? What have you said to the Chinese?*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: *Well, I think what youre getting it at is did we draw a red line and say cross this line and X will happen, and you understand that that would not be a wise approach. In diplomacy Ive learned that ambiguity is a useful tool, but there is no doubt in Beijings mind of our interest. Weve stated it at all levels that they abide by the 97 the joint declaration, the need to ensure that Hong Kong maintains its autonomy and the there would there are consequences. Those consequences are written in law in the Hong Kong Policy Act and other places. So theyre aware of those consequences as well, and so I dont think theres any need to go any further detail on that. The again, if you read the Hong Kong Policy Act and what happens when we determine that Hong Kong does not retain sufficient autonomy, thered be significant economic hits and other things.*MODERATOR: *Carol.*QUESTION: *In Burma, did you walk away with anything concrete, any kind of commitment from the government to treat the Rohingya better? Or did you hear anything give you any confidence that theyre going to not only treat the people better but allow more access that you had sought for humanitarian and other reasons?*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: *Well, I like to think Im pretty good at diplomacy, but this has been a problem thats working on weve been working on this for a very long time. Its not going to go away soon. And in our meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi, she was very gracious. We had a very productive and wide-ranging conversation. The subject of course of the Rakhine State and the Rohingya internally displaced population came up. She acknowledged our concern. She the Burma side is working toward a solution. I think that we all agree that they could be doing more on this, one, to address the issues of identity cards, citizenship, and then the plight of the people who have been in these camps for seven-plus years. These things all need to be addressed.So its not going to theres going to be no overnight resolution, but I do think that, as part of this diplomatic effort, the continuing raising of this issue is important. And so we did that, she took my points, and well move on, continue to work it.*MODERATOR: *Shaun.*QUESTION: *Can I just follow up on that? The International Criminal Court, as of yesterday, is taking up the case of Myanmar. Theres also been legal action in Argentina. How does the United States feel about this? Does it think that this could be a productive way to, as you say, to ensure accountability?*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: *I might say that this just broke last night, Gambia then the the basin OIC pushing on this. Anything we can do to highlight this issue and to move forward on it, I think, would be useful. I think that process Im not going to comment on whether ICC is the right way to go or not. I just think that highlighting it and getting the government in Nay Pyi Taw to take action is important. I would hope that similar attention would be paid to another crisis of its type in Xinjiang, where theres a Muslim population thats being is suffering greatly for the simple fact that theyre Muslim. And so these things all need attention.*MODERATOR: *Conor.*QUESTION: *Just to follow up on that as well, government has really been the impediment to progress on these issues in terms of accountability or the safe and voluntary, dignified return of Rohingya from Bangladesh. Why move forward on the economic relationship? What kind of do you think that sends the wrong message when the U.S. should be instead putting more pressure on the government, perhaps using that as leverage?*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: *Well, one of the things we heard in the IDP camps is they dont have any jobs. They have nowhere to go. They just sit there waiting for food and help to come to them, and thats a terrible way to live. So I mean, theres a lot of ways you can approach it. It seems to me that if you could create some sort of economic growth that comes from industry bringing in either developing Burmese industry or bringing in outside industry and developing the economic foundations, eventually we create at least something like a job that would help people support themselves. Where theres economic stress there tends to be political stress, and the more we can do to help with prosperity, the better. But as I said in my statement, that includes kind of extricating the military out of the economy and moving it and, of course, the political system and making it more something akin to what were used to out here.*QUESTION:* Did you get any assurances from them that they would allow economic development in the in northern Rakhine State? Its something the government has blocked, or that they would try to extricate the military. How do you condition aid or development on those kinds of things?*QUESTION:* What confidence do you have that this money is going to be used for what its intended?*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:* The beautiful thing about investment is it doesnt go into pockets of government; it goes into buildings and machines and things like that that you then fill with people to do jobs. So rather than sending money direct to government, it seems like investment in business and industrial activity in Myanmar seems a decent way to go. I mean, resource-wise, they are flush. There is a lot they could do there. Obviously, you need a secure background to do that in, so thats a concern. But again, theres lots of opportunity there. We look forward to working with them on this. Again, patience is advised, as it has been all along.*MODERATOR:* Whats your name?*QUESTION:* Sarah Ampolsk, Kyodo News. I want to ask you about GSOMIA. You mentioned the meeting you had earlier, I believe, with the new Korean ambassador. The Koreans are still saying that theyre planning to pull out by the deadline, and I know you talked about this a lot when you were in both Tokyo and Seoul. Was there is there any movement on that that youre seeing on the part of the Koreans, even and especially in this mornings meeting? Are they being swayed at all, or are they really just telling you that theyre planning to pull out by the 22nd?*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:* I would definitely push that question to the Korean side and the Japanese side. As I have said before, this is a bilateral issue that started with the decision on forced labor in Korea and then a number of responses to that, the most recent and the one that involves the U.S. being GSOMIA.What were doing is encouraging them to work together. Being in the middle and brokering this thing, as you know and weve said all along thats not in our interest. Its not in their interest. They need to get together and talk more. They need to resolve these things themselves. We are doing all we can to foster that those conversations. And*QUESTION:* But do you see those conversations insofar as you are working to foster those bilateral conversations between the ROK and Japan, do you see movement in that area based on your conversations?*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:* I do. I mean, Ive seen the relationship to use a naval metaphor, for a long time the bow was going down. The bow is beginning to rise. I mean, its starts with the prime ministers trip to Tokyo for the enthronement; and then most recently, at the East Asia summit, we had a bilateral with the prime minister and the president. The photos I saw from that were positive and smiling, so these are all things and really all it needs is a kickstart, right? They just need to get something that allows them to move forward again on the relationship. And so were doing all we can in that regard. Im hopeful, but like I said, Im probably too close to the subject, so I would ask them.*MODERATOR:* Nike.*QUESTION:* Yes, a follow-up on Hong Kong. With the confrontation between the police and protestors took a violent turn recently, in your estimation, do you see the chance to get to a humane solution getting appear to be dimmer? And in your discussion with Zheng Zeguang, what is your takeaway with what China is going to do next? Thank you.*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:* The U.S. has been clear all along on the first thing is the violence has to stop. And waiting around to point blame as to who started what violence there are so many options there. It could be any number of things. So the point is a blanket statement that violence has to stop, period. It doesnt matter what side its on, and I think theres instigators on both sides. And who says theres only both sides? I mean, there I think theres three or four sides in this. So that once you get past the violence, the protests then can be addressed, and the protest, as you recall, began with a law that would allow them to extradite folks from Hong Kong into the mainland for trial there.There have been incidents in the past go back to the Hong Kong booksellers issues where, with or without a extradition law, people have been forcibly removed from Hong Kong and other places, brought to the PRC for punishment and trial. I think they just announced that a professor from Taiwan had just been announced that hes been held for a while. And so I think generally speaking, we would like to see a more transparent legal regime, and I think thats what the Hong Kong people are looking for as well.But lets go back to the root causes. This extradition law was perceived by the people in Hong Kong as significantly infringing on their sovereignty, which contradicts the joint statement and other things. So first off, lets get knock down the violence, address the protests, have a conversation with the people. These are things weve been suggesting all along for the Hong Kong government and for Beijing to get to resolution of some kind here.*MODERATOR:* I think you have time for one more. Ben.*QUESTION:* Is the U.S. coming to the aid of the protesters at some point?*SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:* The that question was just asked, but at this point, the best thing we can do is lay the groundwork for a peaceful conversation vice a violent protest. The violence is understandable.Load-Date: November 16, 2019End of Document

The 17-year-old who got suspended by TikTok after posting viral videos about oppressed Muslims accuses the company of lazy, racist assumptions about Islam and terrorismBusiness Insider USNovember 28, 2019 Thursday 06:47 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1365 wordsByline: ama@businessinsider.com,  (Alexandra Ma)Highlight: Feroza Aziz told Business Insider that TikTok misunderstood the "dark humor" behind her videos, which satirize Islamophobia faced by Muslim Americans.BodyFeroza Aziz/TikTok• TikTok has publicly apologized to a 17-year-old girl whose account was suspended after she posted a series of viral videos about China's mass oppression of Uighur Muslims.• The app repeatedly said it suspended Feroza Aziz's account for violating its anti-terrorism policy by posting a video of Osama bin Laden.• Aziz told Business Insider that she used bin Laden's image to make fun of Islamophobic comments she received as a Muslim American. Business Insider obtained the video, which clearly features bin Laden satirically and for less than one second.• She believes she was instead suspended for her videos raising awareness of China's oppression of Uighur Muslims. TikTok is owned by a Chinese company.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The teenager suspended by the app TikTok after posting viral videos about oppressed Uighur Muslims in China has accused the company of punishing her for what she said were lazy assumptions about Islam and terrorism.Feroza Aziz, a 17-year-old from New Jersey, was suspended from her account on Monday, hours after she posted a three-part series condemning            China's mass crackdown on the Uighurs. The videos, which she disguised as makeup tutorials, went viral.Instagram Embed: //instagram.com/p/B5Tho5TAXZd/embed Width: 540pxTikTok has repeatedly denied suspending Aziz over the videos condemning China. Instead, it says she was suspended because she posted video featuring the terrorist Osama bin Laden on a previous account on November 14.TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance, which routinely purges anti-China political content from the Chinese version of its app. Numerous activists and news outlets have accused it of doing the same on TikTok.It has since issued a public apology to Aziz and reinstated her account, but it            continues to say the suspension was due to the bin Laden video.TikTok has not provided any further details on the video related to bin Laden, despite multiple requests from Business Insider.Aziz has since provided Business Insider with the video. It follows a popular TikTok format of listing men the poster was attracted to when they were younger, compared with the men they liked now.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1199805145644707848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw This is the "video of Osama bin Laden" TikTok says got Feroza Aziz suspended from the platform. https://t.co/yRpiH9jIaN           pic.twitter.com/yzL2FjUjLvBin Laden's image comes up for less than a second at the end the video, satirically tacked onto a list of more conventional crushes, like the singer Zayn Malik and the Bollywood actors Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra.Bin Laden was there for "dark humor purposes" - as a way to make fun of the Islamophobic comments she received while growing up as Muslim American, Aziz told Business Insider."I'm sure that a lot of Muslims have been told that they should go marry a terrorist, that they would look good with a terrorist," she said. "It sounds disgusting, but it's true. This happened to me, and I'm sure it's happened to other people."She added: "But I thought, why don't I just make a lighthearted joke out of this? It would be comments that I've faced every single day ... as a coping mechanism for any other Muslims out there that receive the same harsh oppression that I received."Feroza Aziz/TikTokAziz said that by removing that video, TikTok showed it had failed to understand her and misunderstood it as terrorist-related content instead."TikTok didn't appreciate it, and TikTok didn't understand what my message was," she said. "I wasn't saluting Osama bin Laden. I wasn't preaching his views. I despise him. I despise everything that he believed in.""I don't agree with any of what his beliefs are and what his followers' beliefs are, and I don't have any association with that. So TikTok did not understand my videos' satire content."Aziz was not born when the September 11, 2001, attacks took place. She would have been about 9 years old when bin Laden was killed by US forces in May 2011."While we recognize that this video may have been intended as satire, our policies on this front are currently strict," TikTok said in its Wednesday statement. "Any such content, when identified, is deemed a violation of our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service, resulting in a permanent ban of the account and associated devices."Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesDespite TikTok's public apology on Wednesday, Aziz isn't convinced that the company suspended her over the bin Laden video. Instead she continues to believe it is because she stood up to China for the Uighurs.TikTok in recent months has come under heightened scrutiny of how it handles politically sensitive content."Do I believe they took it away because of a unrelated satirical video that was deleted on a previous deleted account of mine?" Aziz tweeted hours after TikTok's statement. "Right after I finished posting a 3 part video about the Uyghurs? No." (Uyghurs is an alternative spelling.)On October 26, TikTok had removed from her old account another video in which she sought more media coverage of the Uighurs. The platform removed the video, saying it had violated its guidelines, but did not give further explanation.TikTok has not responded to Business Insider's request for comment on this video."I really doubt that TikTok is ultimately saying the truth about what's happening here," Aziz told Business Insider in a conversation that took place before TikTok's apology."I think that something is going on and TikTok doesn't want people to find out what's going in China."Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1199987182406119430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw This is another video Feroza posted on her old TikTok account - also discussing Uighurs in China - on October 26, which she says also got taken down without sufficient explanation. pic.twitter.com/PcafuyR0MNMultiple news outlets have in recent months reported that TikTok employees remove or restrict content deemed "problematic" by the Chinese government - a charge the company has vehemently denied.Chinese tech companies often comply with government orders to censor content and can hand over personal data and private conversations without having to notify users.ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, is trying to separate the US app from its Chinese operations.A leaked excerpt from TikTok's new moderation guidelines, published by the German news site Netzpolitik last Saturday, included instructions not to promote videos related to political protest.TikTok has not responded to Business Insider's requests for comment on the document's contents but did not deny its authenticity.DouyinAziz's videos are part of a growing trend of TikTok users using the platform's short-form videos for political protest.This summer, dozens of Uighurs living in Xinjiang posted videos on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, appearing to show old family photos with footage edited to show themselves crying or gesturing.It was most likely the first time Uighurs in the region were able to communicate with the outside world amid the crackdown.• Read more:• Watch the video featuring Osama bin Laden that TikTok says it suspended a teen over after her other video criticizing China went viral• TikTok issues public apology for suspending the account of the teen behind the viral Chinese takedown video disguised as makeup tutorial• China's ByteDance is moving to separate its TikTok app from its Chinese operations amid a US government probe• TikTok is becoming an unlikely place for women to talk about infertility and reproductive health - and it's a clear sign the platform is for more than just teensNOW WATCH: Watch Elon Musk unveil his latest plan for conquering MarsSee Also:• Watch the video featuring Osama bin Laden that TikTok says it suspended a teen over after her other video criticizing China went viral• TikTok suspended a teen who posted a viral takedown of China disguised as a makeup tutorial, but it claims it's because she posted a video of Osama bin Laden• China used a file-sharing app to round up 40,000 Uighur Muslims for prison camps, a startling insight into how it oppresses people via technologyLoad-Date: November 28, 2019End of Document

SECRETARY MICHAEL R. POMPEO REMARKS TO THE PRESSStates News ServiceNovember 26, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 3370 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:RemarksMichael R. Pompeo, Secretary of StateSECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, everyone. I want to comment this morning on a few terrorism-related matters, a terrorist regime, and a couple other items as well.Before I begin, though, I want to confirm with a heavy heart that a United States citizen, Anil Raj of California, was killed in a terrorist attack on a UN vehicle in Kabul on November 24th. There were five other civilians who were injured, including staff.We extend our condolences to the family and friends of the victim following this tragic incident and send our best wishes for a speedy recovery for those who were injured.Attacks targeting UN personnel working to help the Afghan people are unconscionable, and we condemn this act in the strongest possible terms.Today also marks the 11th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attack.We remember the 166 innocent victims, including six Americans. The brutality of the attack shocked the entire world. It is an effort it is excuse me it is an affront it's an affront to the victims and their families that those who planned the Mumbai attack still have not been convicted.Moving on to the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran. President Trump and I have been following closely the protests that have recently broken out across that country.The Iranian people are, once again, on the streets because of the regime's poor economic management. And instead of addressing their grievances, Tehran has responded with violence and by blaming those outside of the country.Last week, the regime shut down the internet to prevent the truth about the protests from getting out. I asked Iranians I asked Iranians to share their messages with the United States so we could expose and sanction abuses of the Iranian regime.We have received to date nearly 20,000 messages, videos, pictures, notes of the regime's abuses through Telegram messaging services. I hope they will continue to be sent to us.We will continue to sanction Iranian officials who are responsible for these human rights abuses, just like we did last week to Iran's Minister of Communications.The Iranian regime also continues to export cruelty outside its own borders. Last week, an Iranian dissident, Massoud Malvi, was assassinated in Istanbul after he defected to Turkey from Iran.The killing of Mr. Malvi is yet another tragic example in a long string of suspected Iran-backed assassination attempts outside of Iranian soil. The regime's brutality and amorality know no international boundaries.To the courageous people of Iran who refuse to stay silent about 40 years of abuse by the ruling regime, I say simply this: The United States hears you. We support you and we will continue to stand with you in your struggle for a brighter future for your people and for your great nation.As part of our long-standing strategic partnership with Egypt, we continue to raise the fundamental importance of respect for human rights, universal freedoms, and the need for a robust civil society.We call on the Egyptian Government to respect freedom of the press and to release journalists detained in a raid last weekend.Turning to the Chinese Communist Party. We've all seen the "Xinjiang Papers" released in recent days. They detail the Chinese party's brutal detention and systematic repression of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.These reports are consistent with an overwhelming and growing body of evidence that the Chinese Communist Party is committing human rights violations and abuses against individuals in mass detention.We call on the Chinese Government to immediately release all those who are arbitrarily detained and to end its draconian policies that have terrorized its own citizens in Xinjiang.It's not just Muslims that are the largest that are the target of the CCP's hostility. Christians, Tibetans, and other minority groups have also felt the CCP's heavy hand of repression.On a different note regarding China, we congratulate the people of Hong Kong on free, fair, and peaceful district council elections on the 24th of November.The United State continues to support democratic values, fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong as guaranteed by the "one country, two systems" framework, and aspirations of the Hong Kong people.I also have a short announcement on Cuba.Today, the United States is taking action to prevent Cubametales from circumventing U.S. sanctions.Cubametales is a Cuban state-run company and the primary facilitator of illegal oil imports from Venezuela. To further contain their action, we are putting sanctions on another Cuban company, Corporacion Panamericana S.A., pursuant to Executive Order 13850.Cubametales was sanctioned back on July of 2019. It has since had trouble finding companies willing to conduct business with it.It has relied on this company to evade sanctions as it carries out the oil for repression scheme between Cuba and Venezuela, a scheme declared illegal by the legitimate government of Venezuela.The Venezuelan and Cuban people continue to suffer at the hands of despotic actors who put their own interests above the interests of their people.Today's action will further squeeze the illegal, profitmaking scheme Cuba carries out to help the illegitimate dictator Nicolas Maduro and his unraveling network of corrupt advisors.And finally, after the holidays, I'll be hitting the road for some important diplomatic activities.First, I'll head to beautiful Louisville, Kentucky. The University of Louisville will host me for remarks at the McConnell Distinguished Speaker Series. And I'll share some thoughts on what the Trump Administration is continuing to do here in the Western Hemisphere to protect the American people.Then I'll travel to London with the President for a NATO Leaders Meeting, where the President and other allied leaders will talk about a whole host of ways to strengthen the Alliance which is celebrating its 70th anniversary.And then I'll travel on to Morocco. It's one of our strongest partners in the region. And I'm looking forward to reviewing our countries' strong economic, security partnership and discussing future areas of cooperation.And then finally, onto Portugal, to Lisbon. As is the case with so many of our European friends, our robust ties are built on shared values of freedom and democracy. And I look forward to that visit as well.And with that, I'm happy to take a few questions.MS ORTAGUS: Matt.QUESTION: Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Secretary.SECRETARY POMPEO: Happy Thanksgiving, Matt.QUESTION: And thank you for coming down. This is twice in two weeks. It's a good tradition to get into.I just want to ask you very briefly about the Hong Kong and the Xinjiang papers. The President is kind of I don't want to say waffling, but he hasn't made up his mind about this legislation that came out of Congress on this. Is this it would involve sanctions. And I'm just wondering, is this something that you are personally supportive of, those sanctions? And are you willing to take action, sanctions or otherwise, in relation to the Uighurs?And then if I could and I'll accept that you will not like this question or think that it's irrelevant or unimportant, sort of stipulate your annoyance, I expect last Friday, this department released call telephone call logs and some correspondence that show that you had two brief conversations with Rudy Giuliani in late March. This has led to speculation in reports that you were actually involved in the campaign to get to recall Ambassador Yovanovitch from Ukraine. Wondering, did you discuss Ambassador Yovanovitch in those calls with Mayor Giuliani? And did the State Department then mislead or misinform Congress as to the circumstances of her departure in the two letters that were sent to Steny Hoyer and Eliot Engel? Thank you.SECRETARY POMPEO: As for Hong Kong, I think the administration has been pretty clear about our expectations about how Beijing will treat people throughout their country. We have human rights standards that we apply all across the world, and Hong Kong is no different. In addition, in Hong Kong we have the commitments that the Chinese Government made as part of their obligations to maintain one country and two systems. That's what we're continuing to work towards.Congress has now taken action. Since it's before the President, I won't get out in front of what he will do before too long. But suffice to say, I think the administration's policies have been pretty unambiguous, and our support for the Chinese Communist Party's continued commitment to the promises that they made remains unwavering. And I think you saw that from the people of Hong Kong this past week. That's what they're asking for, too, the continued maintenance of the understandings that were committed to under international law.I don't have much to say with respect to the Ukraine investigation, other than this. We've continued to comply with all the legal requirements. You saw we released documents I guess it was last week now. We'll continue to do that as required by law and as appropriate, so that appropriate oversight can be conducted.But with respect to the larger set of issues, we had a very clear policy with respect to Ukraine, and we executed it successfully. There are still many challenges. Still have Russians in the Donbas. We still have a president in Ukraine working to make sure that we move through the challenges that the country's had with its corruption for an awfully long time now. The State Department's been working on that for my now year and a half plus here, and we'll continue to work on it. And every action that I took and have taken will continue to be driven towards that objective.QUESTION: Thank you.MS ORTAGUS: Voice of America.QUESTION: Mr. SecretaryMS ORTAGUS: Go ahead. No, Voice of America. Thank you.QUESTION: Hi. I'm with the Voice of America. So Reporters Without Border strongly condemned today the Iranian intelligence threats against journalists working for the international media like Voice of America, BBC, Radio Free Europe, Manoto. With intimidation on social media and relatives in Iran summoned for interrogation, what's your take on it?SECRETARY POMPEO: So I've seen those reports, and I've certainly seen the Iranians engage in activity that is fundamentally at odds with the central understandings we have here in America about how the press ought to be treated.So I don't know that I have much more to add other than the entirety of how the President has thought about the Middle East and the malevolent activity of the Islamic Republic of Iran drives towards working to eradicate what you've just described. What we've advocated for inside of the Islamic Republic of Iran is a change in the behavior of the regime: Behave like a normal nation which permits its people to engage in commerce, to take care of their families, that would have normal press freedoms. Those are the very, very objectives that are policy has been aimed at for the entire time of the Trump administration. We'll keep working on it. When I see those reports, it reminds me that our work is certainly not yet complete.MS ORTAGUS: Nick.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, two questions.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir.QUESTION: One on Turkey. Now that Turkey is testing the S-400, it looks to be on F16s, is that cause for concern? And will the U.S. take any action in response, possibly levying sanctions?And the other just going back to Ukraine do you believe that the U.S. and Ukraine should investigate the theory that it was Ukraine and not Russia that hacked the DNC emails in 2016?SECRETARY POMPEO: So I'll take your second question first. Any time there is information that indicates that any country has messed with American elections, we not only have a right but a duty to make sure we chase that down. And I served as the CIA director for the first year and a half of this administration. I can assure you there were many countries that were actively engaged in trying to undermine American democracy, our rule of law, the fundamental understandings we have here in the United States. And you should know we were diligently, diligently working to make sure that we addressed each of them with every tool of American power that we had.And so whomever it is by the way, it's not just I said nations, I think. It's not just state actors. There are non-state actors too who are out there acting in ways that are deeply inconsistent with what we're trying to do to protect our elections. America should leave no stone unturned. So whatever nation it is that we have information that so much as suggests that there might have been interference or an effort to interfere in our elections, we have an obligation to make sure that the American people get to go to the ballot box, cast their ballots in a way that is unimpacted by these malevolent actors trying to undermine our Western democratic values.Your first question about Turkey and the S-400 yeah, it's concerning. We are hopeful. We're still talking to the Turks. We're still trying to figure our way through this thing. I don't want to get out in front of what the President may or may not do, but we have made very clear to the Turkish Government our desire to see them move away from the putting into full operationalization the S-400 weapon system.MS ORTAGUS: Nike.QUESTION: Thank you, Morgan.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma'am.QUESTION: Happy Thanksgiving to you, Mr. Secretary.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving to you as well.QUESTION: On Hong Kong, a quick follow-up. Would you recommend President Trump to endorse the bipartisan legislation on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act? The reason I ask is because if it's enacted, it will require secretary of state to certify if Hong Kong retains enough autonomy for favorable trading terms.And separately, if I may, on Xinjiang, as you just mentioned, the new leak of documents published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ revealed the strategy behind a campaign of re-education of Muslim minority groups. Would you say the U.S. pressures have had any effect on China's actions in Xinjiang, and does the new document allow more concrete actions to take against China? Thank you.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. So your first question is I can't really answer it because you point out quite correctly in the second part of that question that that issue will come to me if this were to become law, if the President signs it or it becomes law. That will come to me; I'll have to make this determination. I don't want to prejudge that. I want to make sure that the process here can be run in a fair, neutral way and no one thinks that the secretary of state got out in front of the analysis that will be tasked annually to do under that statute to evaluate whether the requirements there can be certified too.So we're aware of it. Our teams already have a lot of the foundational activity in place that we can perform, I think, a pretty thorough analysis pretty quickly to see if that certification could be made if, in fact, this becomes law. And when we do, we'll make that that will be a published certification. We'll send it to Capitol Hill as required by statute.Your second question is about really about what's the effects of these this newly released information. I think there are really a couple. First, I think it confirms what we've been saying here at the State Department and the United States Government for some time now about what's taking place there the very significant human rights abuses. I think it confirms it, shows that it's not random and it is intentional and that it is ongoing. And so I think those papers simply confirm that. I think the world can see that, which leads me to the second point.I think it's the case now that you'll see many more countries around the world acknowledging what's taking place there and working alongside of the United States to create space and improve human rights conditions for the people of Xinjiang. I'm hopeful that those papers the release of those papers will encourage others to join in what we view as a very important outcome that we're trying to achieve.MS ORTAGUS: Go ahead, Gillian.QUESTION: Mr. SecretarySECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma'am.QUESTION: do you have a comment for the department on the new numbers reports coming out of Xinjiang? There's new information out there that the Communist Party has detained over time up to a million Uighurs. Does State Department have anything on that number?SECRETARY POMPEO: So our best analysis that the number of a million is a reasonable number to think about the number of persons that have been over the extended period of time held or detained or wrongfully denied their fundamental human rights. I think we think that number is about right.QUESTION: So it's and just a quick follow-up, sir. The President tweeted just a short while ago that he'd encourage you, essentially, to testify in the impeachment investigation. Is that something you're considering?SECRETARY POMPEO: When the time is right, all good things happen. (Laughter.)QUESTION: Is that a good thing?MS ORTAGUS: Let's end with Michel.QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Iraq is cracking down on protestors with the live ammunitions, and the Lebanon clashes between Hizballah, Amal, and the demonstrators. What steps are you considering to help peaceful demonstrations in both countries? And on Lebanon, any updates on the military aids to the Lebanese Army? One more on Iran. Will the U.S. be able to provide internet access to the Iranian people soon?SECRETARY POMPEO: So let's see. As for internet access, it's come back on just a bit. We've encouraged the leadership of the Islamic Republic regime to turn it back on so people can communicate. It's worth noting that while that was done to tamp down the protests that took place and, frankly, deny the world access to see some of it, it's not working. Indeed, it's working at cross-purposes. I talked about the 20,000 messages we've received, which we believe all came from inside the Islamic Republic of Iran. We expect we'll get thousands and thousands more over the coming days as well. So there is the capacity for Iranians to communicate outside of the country.The second piece is it shouldn't surprise anyone that when you turn your internet off, the little bit of commercial activity that is already taking place inside of Iran is diminished. Lots of commerce all around the world takes place through electronic communications, and the inability to speak there will further decrease the Iranian economy, which will further deny them to have the resources to conduct terror campaigns around the world.The second question the first question was about Iraq.QUESTION: Iraq and Lebanon demonstrations.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. I don't have anything to say on the Lebanon funding issue today. But as for Iraq, we've been in contact with all the various elements inside of Iraq that we have deal with. Our mission there is largely a counterterrorism mission and that's what our troops are on the ground for. That's who the Vice President went to visit this week. He went to the Kurdistan region as well all in an effort to try and help the Iraqi people stand up a free and independent and sovereign Iraq. That's our goal for the Iraqi people, and we're prepared to work with the Iraqi leadership Prime Minister al-Mahdi, President Barham Salih, Speaker Halbousi all of the Iraqi leadership to try and deliver that on behalf of the Iraqis.We've made no we have no qualms in talking about the fact that we think the Iranian presence there is harmful to that, decreases the risk that the Iraqi people can have the sovereignty that they so richly deserve, and we're confident that the Iraqi leadership wants the same thing that we're helping them work towards.MS ORTAGUS: Okay.QUESTION: Thank you.SECRETARY POMPEO: Great. Thanks, everybody. Have aQUESTION: No questions about Louisville with Senator McConnell. Any significance to that?SECRETARY POMPEO: Have a wonderful Thanksgiving, everyone.

OPINION: Blubaugh: Hard to know whether app is harmless fun for the young or the next online threatCarroll County Times (Westminster, Maryland)December 8, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Carroll County TimesDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: COMMENTARYLength: 751 wordsByline: Bob Blubaugh, Carroll County Times, Westminster, Md.BodyDec. 08--     Dec. 8--As a parent, two decades into the 21st century, you're well-conditioned to be aware of online threats to you kids.So we try to monitor which websites our kids go to, paying particular attention to what's hot on YouTube, we keep track of what apps are being downloaded and, of course, attempt to vigilantly be on the lookout for cyberbullying in the wild west that is social media, with a laser focus on Snapchat, which might as well have been designed by teens intent on keeping things away from the prying eyes of parents.But what if an insidious, potentially dangerous online threat comes from a seemingly harmless, fun app that millions of high school- and middle school-aged kids use multiple times every single day?TikTok is a videosharing social networking service launched in 2017. About a year ago, it became the most downloaded app in the United States, the first time an app by a Chinese-based company had held that distinction. The "About Us" portion of TikTok's homepage says, "TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy."It is hugely popular here and in many parts of the world, closing in on 100 million American downloads and a billion worldwide. Interestingly, it not allowed to "inspire creativity and bring joy" in China, however.My middle school kids love this app. They're constantly making short lip-sync and dance videos. At home, in the car, at school, at sports practices, everywhere. I've even been roped into a couple of them, more than likely not for my talents so much as to be made fun of by my kids.They do these videos mostly just for themselves or to be shared with a tight circle of friends. The app can be set to "private," so no one else can see what you're doing on TikTok.Except, of course, for TikTok, which sees all.Recently, TikTok came under fire when a 17-year-old New Jersey user named Feroza Aziz was suspended from the platform for mixing a little politics into a video she created that began as a makeup tutorial. Amidst the beauty tips, she urged her viewers to look into China's repression and the cultural genocide of its Uighur Muslim minority.TikTok, whose parent company, ByteDance, is based out of Beijing, claims to operate completely independently of the Chinese government. According to the Washington Post, TikTok says "its content moderation policies in the United States are sensitive to this country's different norms around free expression" and that the suspension of Aziz's account "had nothing to do with her stand against the atrocities in Xinjiang. Instead, she had violated TikTok's rules against 'terrorist content' by referencing Osama bin Laden in a separate satirical post."Sure it was. And sure TikTok operates completely independently of the Chinese government.Aziz's account is no longer suspended and TikTok blamed human moderation error, but Aziz doesn't buy that. Nor should anyone. A leaked excerpt of the platform's terms revealed that its reviewers are instructed to reduce the visibility of political and protest content -- such as depictions of public assemblies that "include violence." One can only assume that demonstrations critical of China are among the content being suppressed.Remember when we believed the internet could democratize and bring freedom to all corners of the world? It can't happen when certain world powers are intent on not allowing it to happen. And considering how much influence the Chinese government has over American companies from airlines to the NBA, who would question how much it has over a company based out of that nation's capital?A good friend of ours told us he won't let his daughter use TikTok. He is convinced that everything its young users post is being stored and analyzed and will be used years from now by the Chinese government to blackmail them.That seems a little far-fetched even for a capricious superpower -- I'm guessing the only blackmailing being done regarding my kids' videos will be them threatening to expose my embarrassing performances.Of course, five years ago I wouldn't have believed a capricious superpower would meddle in a United States election, either.Bob Blubaugh is the editor of the Carroll County Times.

Through the Lyft partnership, Gett's corporate customers traveling in the United States will be able to request rides through the Gett app and be matched with a driver on the Lyft network. This partnership will allow Gett to expand its reach across the United States, seamlessly serving its business clients on the Lyft network, all through Gett's SaaS platform for business travelers.Juno is shutting down in New York today as a result of both Gett's increased focus on the corporate transportation sector and the enactment of misguided regulations in New York City earlier this year. All Juno riders will be invited to join Lyft.11:16TALKX Market Briefing: Market checks up on tweet checkThus far, there hasn't been any follow-through on Friday's record-setting advance for the major indices, which are sporting modest losses.There is a bit of a hesitation/defensive trade mindset at work today after China-based CNBC anchor Eunice Yoon tweeted earlier this morning that a government source has told her that the mood in Beijing about a trade deal is pessimistic because President Trump hasn't endorsed any tariff rollbacks.This tweet conflicted with some of Friday's optimism, which was based on NEC Director Kudlow's indication that the two sides were getting close to an agreement and were down to the "short strokes."The fact that today's losses are far more modest that Friday's gains underscores an otherwise sticky belief that a deal of some kind will be reached; however, history on these matters dictates allowing some room for disappointment. Buyers, therefore, aren't rushing back into today's action, but knowing this market has refused to buckle on any negative-sounding news, is keeping the selling efforts in check as well.Currently, the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+1.0%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.7%) sectors are winning standouts, while the energy (-1.4%), industrials (-0.5%), and financial (-0.3%) sectors bring up the rear.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.5%.10:58XLP Sector Briefing: Bond Proxies (61.89 +0.56)The early portion of today's session has seen losses in most sectors, but there are some pockets of relative strength, as rate-sensitive consumer staples (+0.9%), utilities (+0.9%), and real estate (+0.7%) trade with solid gains.The three sectors account for just 14.0% of the entire S&P 500, so they have a limited impact on the overall performance of the market, but today's outperformance is largely due to one common factor: falling interest rates.Treasury yields backed down from three-month highs during the past week and they have already dipped beneath last week's lows today. Today's pressure on yields comes after a CNBC reporter in Beijing tweeted that the Chinese government has a pessimistic view of trade negotiations with the U.S., according to government sources.The continued pressure on Treasury yields means that high-yielding sectors like utilities, real estate, and consumer staples are becoming more attractive to investors.Notable movers:Consumer staples: Coty (COTY 12.18, +0.27, +2.3%), Kimberly-Clark (KMB 133.91, +2.28, +1.7%), Colgate-Palmolive (CL 67.50, +1.13, +1.7%), Walmart (WMT 120.52, +1.65, +1.4%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.00, +1.46, +1.2%). Utilities: Eversource Energy (ES 82.58, +1.31, +1.6%), NextEra Energy (NEE 234.20, +2.78, +1.2%), American Electric Power (AEP 90.79, +1.23, +1.4%), CMS Energy (CMS 61.63, +0.73, +1.2%), and Evergy (EVRG 65.53, +0.78, +1.2%). Real estate: Realty Income (O 78.68, +1.22, +1.6%), Equinix (EQIX 558.00, +7.59, +1.4%), Crown Castle International (CCI 136.38, +1.70, +1.3%), Welltower (WELL 85.13, +1.14, +1.4%), Healthpeak Properties (PEAK 34.97, +0.52, +1.5%).10:54ECONX President Trump tweets confirmation of 'cordial' meeting with Fed Chair Powell (311.75 -0.04)Tweet10:37ECONX Fed Chair Powell met with with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump this morning; he reiterated his monetary policy outlook, which will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economyAt the President's invitation, Chair Powell met with the President and the Treasury Secretary Monday morning at the White House to discuss the economy, growth, employment and inflation.Chair Powell's comments were consistent with his remarks at his congressional hearings last week. He did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economy.Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective and non-political analysis.10:31OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:LOW Weekly Nov22 120 calls are seeing interest with 1300 contracts trading vs. open int of 110, pushing implied vol up around 18 points to ~79%.

In ORION-9, twice-yearly dosing (following initial and three-month doses) with inclisiran sodium 300 mg met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, was well-tolerated and demonstrated an excellent safety profile. Full study results were presented during a late-breaking science session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions in Philadelphia.For the primary endpoints of ORION-9, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 50% (71 mg/dL, p<0.0001) at day 510 in HeFH patients and demonstrated time-averaged placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 45% (63 mg/dL, p<0.0001) from days 90 through 540. The overall adverse event profiles of the placebo- and inclisiran-treated groups in ORION-9 were similar. At least one serious treatment emergent adverse event was experienced by 13.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group and 7.5% of patients in the inclisiran-treated group. The incidences of deaths (0.4% vs. 0.4%) and malignancies (1.3% vs. 0.8%) were similar between the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively. Low incidences of clinically significant elevations in liver function tests (ALT 0.4% vs. 1.2%, AST 0.4% vs. 0.8%) and serum creatinine increases (0.4% vs. 0.4%) were observed in the placebo and inclisiran groups, respectively, and none were considered related to study drug. Clinically relevant adverse events at the injection site, predominantly mild and always transient, were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients vs. 13.7% of inclisiran-treated patients.09:02SSTK Shutterstock appoints Jarrod Yahes as CFO, effective December 9 (42.19 )Since October 2016, Mr. Yahes has served as the Chief Financial Officer at Zeta Global, a marketing technology company.09:01CYTK Cytokinetics and Amgen (AMGN) present results from COSMIC-HF (8.18 )Amgen, Cytokinetics, and Servier announced that new results from COSMIC-HF (Chronic Oral Study of Myosin Activation to Increase Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 2 trial evaluating omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), will be presented today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2019. In patients with HFrEF treated with omecamtiv mecarbil, in addition to previously reported improvements in cardiac contractility measures (including systolic function, or pumping action of the heart), measures of diastolic function were not different from placebo and, for some measures, trended towards improvement. In COSMIC-HF, 448 patients with stable, symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% were randomly assigned to omecamtiv mecarbil or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 20 weeks. This post-hoc analysis assessed the effect of chronic therapy with omecamtiv mecarbil by treatment group on echocardiographic measures of diastolic function, including early (E-wave) and late (A-wave) peak mitral inflow velocities, early peak myocardial relaxation velocity (e'), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV), and diastolic filling time. In patients with HFrEF who received omecamtiv mecarbil, systolic ejection time increased as previously reported and expected, while diastolic filling time was not reduced, nor were diastolic parameters worsened. Specifically, in patients receiving omecamtiv mecarbil E-wave velocity, E/A-ratio, and E/e' or e' were not significantly changed compared to placebo. There was a small increase (<5 ms) in the duration of the IVRT, and in the PK group, TRV, an indicator of pulmonary pressure, improved significantly during treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil therapy.09:01OSTK Overstock.com declares regular annual cash dividend for 2019 of $0.16 per share on the company's Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock and of $0.16 per share on its Voting Series B Preferred Stock (8.33 )08:51LH Laboratory Corp commences senior notes offering (171.55 )LabCorp intends to use proceeds for general corporate purposes that may include (1) the purchase, redemption, or repayment at maturity of its outstanding 2.625% Senior Notes due Feb. 1, 2020, (2) the purchase of up to $300 mln aggregate purchase price of its 4.625% Senior Notes, due November 15, 2020 in a concurrent tender offer, and (3) the repayment of some or all of the amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facilities.08:50LOV Spark Networks appoints Eric Eichmann as CEO (5.59 )Eric will replace Jeronimo Folgueira who is stepping down from the role as chief executive officer.

China had a lot to do with the strength after state media reports suggested Phase One talks have been constructive over the weekend. Also, the PBOC announced a key interest rate cut. This has supported markets and put US futures into all-time high territory. The S&P is just off the high of 3127.75, trading around 3124. This is well off the overnight low of 3113.75.In Asia, China took the spotlight with the news out of the region. The PBOC's rate cut of its seven-day repurchase rate, took it down to 2.50% from 2.55%. The move was unexpected. This helped the Shanghai gain 0.6% on Monday and essentially get all of Friday's losses back. Hong Kong managed to bounce over 1% after suffering heavy losses last week. Japan quietly rose 0.5%. European markets saw a small pop early but have settled back in since. Although most of the trading has been lackluster, mining stocks are among the weakest groups with Gold, Silver and Platinum down in the range of 0.7-1.3%.

The S&P 500 (+0.8%) closed above the 3100 level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%) closed above 28,000 -- both for the first time.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.7%) also closed at a record high, while the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) continued to trail its large-cap peers.The S&P 500 health care sector did the heavy lifting on Friday, climbing 2.2%, even as the Trump administration announced an initiative to increase price transparency from hospitals and insurers. Investors were evidently unconcerned about the proposal leading to an adverse effect on earnings.No other S&P 500 sector increased 1.0%, but the continued outperformance of Apple (AAPL 265.76, +3.12, +1.2%), Microsoft (MSFT 149.97, +1.91, +1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1334.87, +23.41, +1.8%) should not be understated. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.86, +0.44, +1.0%) and Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.9%) also showed relative strength.Retail stocks extended yesterday's advance after October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Semiconductor stocks benefited from the trade news and the solid results and guidance from Applied Materials (AMAT 62.06, +5.10, +9.0%). Conservative guidance from NVIDIA (NVDA 204.19, -5.60, -2.7%) did limit gains, though.Interestingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout on Friday.Separately, T-Mobile US (TMUS 78.07, +1.23, +1.6%) CEO John Legere is no longer considering the CEO role at WeWork, according to CNBC. Shares of RH (RH 188.47, +13.25, +7.6%) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY 38.95, +1.19, +3.2%) outperformed after Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B 219.74, +0.38, +0.2%) disclosed new positions in the companies.U.S. Treasuries didn't sell off despite the risk-on mentality in the stock market, but they did edge lower. The 2-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.99. WTI crude rose 0.9%, or $0.99, to $57.75/bbl.Reviewing Friday's batch of economic data:October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) following an unrevised 0.3% decline in September. Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) after declining an unrevised 0.1% decline in September.The key takeaway from the report, other than it shows continued growth in discretionary spending, is that it will be a positive input for Q4 GDP. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline, building materials, and food services and drinking places sales, and which factor into the goods component of the PCE calculation, were up 0.3%.Import prices for October were down 0.5%. Excluding fuel, they were down 0.2%. Export prices were down 0.1%. Excluding agricultural products, they were down 0.3%.The key takeaway from the report is that it points to an indolent inflation backdrop.Industrial production slumped 0.8% in October (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.3% decline (from -0.4%) in September. The capacity utilization rate fell to 76.7% (Briefing.com consensus 77.1%) from 77.5% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that, while the GM strike had a big impact on industrial production, things were still weak excluding that impact. To wit, the Federal Reserve reports industrial production declined 0.5% excluding motor vehicles and parts.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) after a downwardly revised 0.1% decline (from 0.0%) in August. Total business sales were down 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.1% increase (from 0.2%) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+3.7%) and sales growth (+0.5%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.Looking ahead, investors will receive Net Long-Term TIC Flows for September on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.7% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTD16:02PJC Piper Jaffray authorizes $150 mln common stock repurchase program (76.25 +0.61)Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 18, 2019End of Document

CHINA TIGHTENS GRIP FURTHER ON INTERNET USERS, MULLS LIVESTREAMING BANStates News ServiceDecember 11, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 570 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The ruling Chinese Communist Party has taken further steps to tighten control over the country's internet with a proposed ban on livestreaming and orders to state-run organizations to replace foreign-branded computer equipment with domestic equivalents.The ministry of culture and tourism issued a draft set of regulations stating that webcasts must be delayed by at least three minutes before being broadcast, with effect from Dec. 22, with specially hired censors to screen the content before it goes live."Online broadcasters should formulate live broadcast management procedures and emergency contingency plans, recruit special personnel to conduct a real-time review of live broadcast content and interactive content like user comments," the directive, which has been released for comments, said."[Reviewers must] promptly deal with any problems, and retain all video footage for at least 60 days for future reference," it said.It said the ministry has a duty to "prevent the occurrence of content that violates the constitution, laws, regulations and other provisions."Sichuan-based internet user He Kun said the ruling Chinese Communist Party has long regarded the general population as a hostile force to the reckoned with."Nowadays people, especially dissidents, daren't criticize [the government] online ... if you make a mistake and do something forbidden, they can detain you in a matter of minutes," He said."It is getting harder and harder to exist in such a space."The proposed controls on livestreaming came after the government required all departments and state-run entities to phase out any foreign-manufactured computer equipment in the next three years and replace it with domestically produced hardware.Ye Yaoyuan, a professor at St. Thomas University in the United States, said the move will achieve two things."The first is that it sends a signal to the Western world that they don't need to rely on its technology any more," Ye said. "The second is that, as part of the trade war, Chinese President Xi Jinping will need to take some measures if he does not want to been seen as kowtowing to the U.S.""The replacement of foreign technology products sends a message to the Chinese people that we don't have to worry about the trade war, because ... we don't need to buy this stuff from others; we have our own," he said.Xie Jiaye, head of the New York-based Chinese Association of Science and Technology, said China is still pretty dependent on foreign technology imports, however."A high proportion of computers used by Chinese companies and government departments computers, especially software, are imported," Xie said.The move comes after Washington moved to limit the use of Chinese technology, including the use of telecommunications equipment made by Huawei and artificial intelligence by SenseTime. It is likely to hit U.S. tech companies like HP, Dell, and Microsoft.The Financial Times estimated that 20 million to 30 million pieces of foreign-made hardware will need to be replaced. It said the process will begin next year.Ye said Chinese companies are entirely capable of developing a homegrown computer industry, but that a lack of competition could lead to quality issues in the long term.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese, and by Han Jie for the Mandarin Service.

The markets got a pop after reports surfaced that Liu He, Steve Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer conducted a phone call yesterday evening in which the two sides agreed to keep communicating over the remaining details of the Phase One deal. The call itself gave the S&P a spike up to 3145, but that was reversed when further details emerged that the call did not amount to anything of substance. Nonetheless, the S&P is currently trading about a point lower around 3132. This is slightly off the overnight low of 3128.00.In Asia, the Nikkei made a 52-week high, while the Shanghai was flat. Japanese stocks were led higher by technology names such as Tokyo Electron and TDK, which rose over 3%.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group.

China and the Markets, Trading Target, Eye on Cornerstone OnDemand: Market ReconRealMoneyNovember 21, 2019 Thursday 8:16 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1511 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: Clearly, Wednesday was a day of broad portfolio distribution. Not, however, the end of the world.BodyIt was the kind of action that could easily be missed. At first. If traders took their eyes off off their screens just a few minutes before 1 pm ET on Wednesday, and then looked back...surely they did something of a double take. The major indices did the swan dive on simply wild trading volume. Ever see the king of monsters, Godzilla rise from the sea just before trashing most of Tokyo? Exactly. Just like that.News had broken. Reuters had published a piece suggesting that any completion of a "Phase One" trade deal between the U.S. and China could slide into next year. The article really brought up no new issues, China pressing for an extensive rollback in tariffs, the U.S. demanding more of China, but financial markets were in a fragile position, having priced in perhaps more optimism that was indeed warranted.The FandangoSo, it would be that the entire market would end up doing the Fandango. Traders bought up the bond proxies such as Utilities, REITs and Staples, not to mention bonds themselves. Thursday evening, the U.S. 10 year topped out at a yield of little more than 1.71%. For the most part, traders tossed out sectors reliant upon global growth such as Industrials, and Materials, as well as the semiconductor/hardware side of the Tech sector. Energy, however, did its own thing. WTI Crude rebounded on a lighter than expected inventory build despite a U.S. dollar bill, y'all that strengthened versus its peers as the day dragged on.The bottom line (or is it?) would be that equity markets in general, sold off on high volume. Volume at the exchanges exploded. Volume attributable to the broader indices landed well above moving averages. Breadth (not breath, though that may be awful as well) was bad. Losers beat winners 4-3 at the New York Stock Exchange and by almost 2-1 at the Nasdaq Market Site. Clearly, this was a day of broad portfolio distribution. Not, however, the end of the world.Liu He To The RescueWhile it did seem that "the big one" might be underway, support showed up. "They" bought the dip, again. A potentially awful day did not develop. What the? One day after the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a pro-human rights bill limiting munitions sales to Hong Kong in support of pro-democracy protesters, the U.S. House of Representatives passed by a 417-1 score a bill merging the Senate bill with one that they had already passed. This puts the football in the president's lap.Traders might think (I might think) that this puts the administration in a delicate position at a difficult moment. Enter Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who overnight, reportedly said publicly that he was "cautiously optimistic" in regards to reaching that "Phase One" trade deal with the U.S. Equity index futures trading in the U.S. that had been considerably lower, in response weaker equity performance across both Asia and Europe headed for daylight. As I bang out this morning note, I have watched our implied opening turn from very red, to kind of red, to green.What is obvious here is that we just have too much information, and algorithms lead on every headline. Does it mean a lot that Lie He remains sort of optimistic? I'm optimistic every year at Spring Training. My team still hasn't won the trophy since 1986. Can President Trump "slow walk" making a decision on the Hong Kong bill headed for his desk? The bill surely angers the Chinese government. Does this make the bill a point of leverage? If so, where does that leave us as a people, ethically? Not easy questions to answer. For anyone.Daily UpdateLadies and gentlemen, the spread between the yields of the three month T-bill and the 10 year note. New kids, I want you to get in the habit of checking this spread every day, in fact check it every time you see markets move. This is the spread that has been running things for almost four months now.Awful couple of weeks, isn't it? Even with an impotent "golden cross" staring traders in the face.Risk ManagementThis is a lesson for novice traders. For they are my people. Seasoned pros, I love you, but hopefully you are able to defend yourself at this point. Remember my Target  short position from my Real Money piece on Wednesday? Well, the position did not play out as planned, which is excellent. Excellent? Sarge, you're losing money. No worries, gang, I always stay within myself, and I have always (in my opinion) been an above average risk manager. Okay, I'm confident. Fight me, bro. So what does a trader do, when a trader is left carrying a bad short position? Hmm. Let's go there.For background, I wrote to you yesterday and told you that I had shorted Target in the pre-opening session, even though I liked the stock, because I saw the rally as excessive. I was wrong. The rally kept going. There were several moments in the morning where I could have turned a quick profit. Alas, I did not. Instead, I shorted my first lot at $121.22, and shorted the darned thing all the way up to $126.67. By the time that I had shut it down, I was left with an average price of $125.05, and a position twice the size that I had in mind when I started. TGT closed at $126.43. There was much weight lifted after the bell. Old guys rule. Just sayin'.What can a trader, at that point do? Door number one is the ugly choice. That's the one where the trader simply bites the bullet and buys back the shares out of fear that losses gets out of hand. Door number two opens new traders, unaware of just how helpful the flexibility created through understanding the proper use of options can be in the prosecution of risk management. Patience is however... required. As are shirts and shoes.Trade Idea (minimal lots)Assumed: Short position of 100 Target with a net basis of $125.05, last sale $126.43. The plan is to cap the loss at a level deemed acceptable to the trader, while mitigating that expense by setting up a profitable trade where desired. Got me? (This is where you say "gotcha") Good. Let's move. (By the way, 99% of pundits out there will not be this honest with you, nor will they teach you how to defend yourself. You only get this stuff at Real Money. So, rock on.)- Purchase one December 20th TGT $130 call (last sale: $1.87)- Sell (write) one December 20th TGT $123 put (last sale: $1.87)Optional add-on- Sell (write) one December 20th TGT $120 put (last sale: $1.12)Notes:A) What the purchase does is cap this loss at under $5, which is actually my limit on this one.B) In this example, the trader pays for that purchase (its free!) by committing to a potential $123 equity purchase (remember, we're short these) upon expiration in one month's time should the shares sell off. Now, we have created a defined range for our repurchase. Risk managed.C) About the add-on... Should the same trader know where they are willing to get long the shares, not buy back the short, but get long, the trader can commit to that exposure as well. What this does, is reduce the loss by $1.12 should the trader end up exercising the $130 call, or reduce net basis to $118.88 should the trader end up paying $120, after already realizing a profit on the short. Sarge, we love you. Thank you, thank you very much.Eye On Cornerstone OnDemand Just who the heck are these guys? Ahh, just a cloud-based human resources software developer with a focus on workforce e-training that has been creating programs that themselves focus on workplace rules and appropriate behavior.There are a few things you should know. Cornerstone OnDemand  has been targeting a younger crowd for training, Gen Z. Earlier this month, the firm announced a partnership with Facebook's  Oculus subsidiary to offer virtual reality type workplace training. While revenue has been growing at an 8% clip as of Q3, subscription revenue growth is twice as fast. Oh, and the firm has also authorized a $150 million shares buyback program as of this past summer.The chart is what caught my attention to be honest, more so than the deal with Facebook. This stock seems to be in the middle of a potential breakout of a cup with handle formation, while continuing to display health Relative Strength as well as a bullish looking daily MACD. The pivot here is $60.25. Should that spot hold, there is no technical reason why these shares can not see $72 (20%), or $75 (25%). If I do go there, and I might, the $55 level lines up as a potential panic point (8% discount).Economics (All Times Eastern)08:30 - Initial Jobless Claims (Weekly):Expecting 216K, Last 225K.08:30 - Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index (Nov):Expecting 7.2, Last 5.6.10:00 - Existing Home Sales (Oct): Expecting 5.49M, Last 5.38M.10:00 - Leading Indicators (Oct):Expecting -0.1% m/m, Last -0.1% m/m.10:30 - Natural Gas Inventories (Weekly):Last +3B cf.The Fed (All Times Eastern)08:30 - Speaker:ClevelandFed Pres.

AMERICA NEEDS TO CREATE ALTERNATIVES TO CHINA AND HUAWEI'S 5G MARKET DOMINANCEStates News ServiceDecember 22, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1029 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):At the recent NATO Leaders Summit in London, President Trump was clear about how he and the United States government view Chinese Communist Party (CCP) linked telecommunications equipment manufacturers like Huawei and ZTE, when he said, "I do think it's a security risk, a security danger." But here is the challenge for the President and his Administration: even our closest allies, few of whom question the threat, are understandably focused on the next question--if not CCP-linked telecommunications equipment, whose?Since taking office, the Trump Administration has changed the rules of the game when it comes to confronting the CCP and its state- and privately-owned enterprises (which are also at the beck-and-call of the Party thanks to the 2017 National Security Law of the People's Republic of China).First, he issued a sweeping Executive Order on Securing Information and Communications Technology and Services, which prohibits the federal government from using telecommunications equipment from other than trusted vendors--Huawei and ZTE, while not mentioned, would, of course, not qualify. This executive order complemented section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2019, which prohibited outright Huawei and ZTE, but also CCP-linked video surveillance equipment, which is involved in such atrocities as the ongoing suppression of the Chinese Uighur minority.Second, this past May, the President ordered Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to place Huawei on the department's "entity list", which prohibits U.S. firms from selling almost anything to that company. As that broad action has been implemented, it's been clear the Trump Administration is targeting most harshly those technologies Huawei most needs to roll-out its own 5G capability.And the independent Federal Communications Commission, under the leadership of Chairman Pai (who was appointed by President Trump), has been modernizing the regulatory framework to promote the 5G implementation in the United States.Despite all of these actions and an unprecedented level of focus at the highest level of our government (the President himself in many cases), there are grave risks in the months ahead.While several allies, for example, Australia and Japan, have taken steps to effectively bar Huawei from their 5G systems, several other of our closest allies may soon make a decision that will set back global security, regional security, and, perhaps most alarming, bilateral security arrangements with the United States.Take, for example, America's closest ally: the United Kingdom. If there is a positive side effect from the recent general election in that country, it's this: when a general election has been called, by law, the incumbent government cannot make a major policy decision.There is likely no more "major policy decision" than whether or not to allow Huawei into the U.K.'s 5G infrastructure effectively, into the heart of the world's most successful intelligence sharing alliances, "the five eyes." And, with any luck, the Shakespearean tragedy that is Brexit may allow several more months of margin to put off further what could be the largest rupture in the "Special Relationship" since Dolley Madison was forced to rip George Washington's picture from the walls of the White House.Why would a country like the U.K. risk such a schism with its closest ally, especially at a moment of its closest need (i.e., during Brexit)? Simply put, a very rational fear that if it doesn't, it will fall behind in the race to deploy 5G and the promised economic gains it will generate.But why is that the choice? Simply put, it is not enough for the United States to explain the risks of using CCP-linked technology, like Huawei's or ZTE's. Those risks are largely beyond dispute. Even the European Union, whose requirements for consensus typical preclude bold positions, went so far as to warn member states of the risks posed by companies who are subject to the kind of national security law that China adopted in 2017.What's needed is for the United States to offer allies and partners a clear alternative to Huawei (and ZTE) on 5G. Because of artificial subsidies in the Chinese market, and export incentives for the international market, Huawei offers a complete 5G capability to countries and their telecommunications providers at prices no actual private company can meet. Thanks to the Chinese Communist Party, in other words, there is no longer a free market when it comes to the most-advanced telecommunications equipment.But the Administration has been fighting back (as noted above). Altogether, the actions taken by the Trump Administration have created what amounts to a sanctuary but only a temporary one into which the U.S. government can incentivize private companies, like Samsung, Cisco, Ericson and Nokia, to compete on a more level playing field. Even now, the CCP is directing its companies to find ways to change their supply chains to reduce their reliance on the United States and other markets.The United States government has long been comfortable setting industrial policy when it comes to national defense. Indeed, we have the Internet today because of the Defense Department's directed innovation. What's needed now is a similar approach for both the domestic market and those of its allies.Imagine the combined market and technological potential of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Japan, Australia, South Korea and Taiwan. Even the People's Republic of China would find it challenging to distort the market and defeat trusted vendor 5G solutions put forward by such a combination of allies.If the Trump Administration builds on its progress to date, we can give allies like the United Kingdom a genuine alternative that doesn't cost them their competitive edge. I'll be the first to buy Prime Minister Johnson a new phoneI'll throw in a new hairbrush.Tim Morrison was most recently Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security and the National Security Council's Senior Director for European Affairs.Load-Date: December 29, 2019End of Document

For the next 26 days, retailers will be after your walletCNN WireNovember 29, 2019 Friday 12:10 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 714 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  Happy Friday. A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.Black Friday is here, and you know what that means: the holiday shopping season is in full swing. Retailers are under even more pressure than usual. With six fewer shopping days this year between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the clock is ticking for stores to get customers through the door.The stakes: To understand why December matters so much to retailers, just look at the numbers. Last year, Target brought in 30% of its annual revenue during the fourth quarter, according to data compiled by Cowen. Macy's and Kohl's both collected 34% of their revenue during the quarter.Of course, for retailers, these are no ordinary times. Consumer spending remains strong, but there are other forces at play.Just look at this piece from my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica, who writes that mall owners are finding creative ways to fill vacancies:"The giant spaces that once housed a single anchor tenant are being reconfigured to attract multiple smaller shops. Empty stores are being filled with new kinds of tenants --- hospital offices, pop-up shops for digital brands and even sports centers."Some choice tidbits: A Sears in Ohio is being demolished and replaced by an indoor golf center, while a Barney's in Arizona now houses co-working space and an Apple Store.A personal favorite: Mall owner Macerich has launched a program called BrandBox that works with e-commerce companies to set up physical pop-up stores.It's a creative strategy, but doesn't change that fact that people are increasingly comfortable shopping online --- particularly on their phones. Per Cowen, 50% or more of digital traffic during the holidays is expected to come from mobile, which is forecast to drive 30% to 35% of online revenue. Happy scrolling.US law complicates trade talksPresident Donald Trump's decision to sign legislation in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters this week isn't likely to derail US-China trade talks --- but it will complicate negotiations said to be at a crucial juncture.Trump, eager to reach a deal, tried to couch the move, which had overwhelming support from US lawmakers. He said he had signed the bill "out of respect for President Xi [Jinping], China, and the people of Hong Kong."China responded by summoning the US ambassador. Beijing said Thursday that the signing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act was "plainly bullying behavior" and was "opposed by the Chinese government and Chinese people."Investor insight: UBS said in a note to clients Friday that it doesn't think the legislation will "significantly" alter the state of play.The bank's strategists noted Trump's "conciliatory tone toward China when signing the legislation, signaling an intent to continue cordial trade negotiations."But it's still a complicating factor in an already complex process. From analysts at Commerzbank: "Obviously, the Hong Kong bill could create another obstacle for the already struggling negotiation process."The grocery delivery wars are heating up in AsiaThe fight to get out front on grocery delivery looks increasingly global. See here: Japanese retail giant Aeon is teaming up with UK grocery delivery company Ocado in a move that signals it wants to take on both Amazon and Walmart.Shares of Ocado jumped nearly 13% in early trading in London. They've skyrocketed more than 70% this year. Other notable Ocado partners include Kroger, which signed an exclusive deal to use Ocado's technology in the United States last year, and UK high street mainstay Marks & Spencer.Aeon will utilize Ocado's system of robotic warehouses and its software to compete in an increasingly cutthroat sector.

FORMER CIA OFFICER SENTENCED FOR CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT ESPIONAGEUS Fed NewsNovember 22, 2019 Friday 3:00 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1313 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Nov. 22 -- The U.S. Department of Justice issued the following press release:A former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case officer was sentenced today to 19 years in prison for conspiring to communicate, deliver and transmit national defense information to the People's Republic of China (PRC)."In just over a year, we have convicted three Americans for committing espionage offenses on behalf of the Chinese government. Each has now received a sentence of at least a decade," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. "Sadly, all three of them are former members of the U.S. Intelligence Community. These convictions and sentences should send a strong message to current and former security clearance holders: be aware that the Chinese government targets you -- and if you betray us, be aware that the Department of Justice will hold you accountable.""As I stated at the time of the defendant's admission of guilt, those Americans entrusted with our government's most closely held secrets have a tremendous responsibility to safeguard that information," said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. "Instead of embracing that responsibility and honoring his commitment to not disclose national defense information, Lee sold out his country, conspired to become a spy for a foreign government, and then repeatedly lied to investigators about his conduct. This prosecution and sentence should serve as a clear warning to others who are contemplating selling out to the highest bidder and capitalizing on their position of trust. My thanks to the prosecutors, agents and our intelligence community partners for their terrific work on this important case."According to court documents, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 55, left the CIA in 2007 and began residing in Hong Kong. In April 2010, two Chinese intelligence officers (IOs) approached Lee and offered to pay him for national defense information he had acquired as a CIA case officer. The IOs also told Lee they had prepared for him a gift of $100,000 cash, and they offered to take care of him "for life" in exchange for his cooperation.Beginning sometime in May 2010 and continuing into at least 2011, Lee received requests for information, or taskings, from the Chinese IOs. The majority of the taskings asked Lee to reveal sensitive information about the CIA, including national defense information. On May 14, 2010, Lee made or caused to be made a cash deposit of $138,000 HKD (approximately $17,468 in USD) into his personal bank account in Hong Kong. This would be the first of hundreds of thousands of dollars (USD equivalent) in cash deposits Lee made or caused to be made into his personal HSBC account from May 2010 through December 2013.On May 26, 2010, Lee created on his laptop computer a document that described, among other things, certain locations to which the CIA would assign officers with certain identified experience, as well as the particular location and timeframe of a sensitive CIA operation. After Lee created this document, he transferred it from his laptop to a thumb drive. The document included national defense information of the United States that was classified at the Secret level.In August 2012, the FBI conducted a court-authorized search of a hotel room in Honolulu, Hawaii, registered in Lee's name. The search revealed that Lee possessed the thumb drive within his personal luggage. The FBI forensically imaged the thumb drive and later located the document in the unallocated space of the thumb drive, meaning that it had been deleted. The search also revealed that Lee possessed a day planner and an address book that contained handwritten notes made by Lee that mostly related to his work as a CIA case officer prior to 2004. These notes included, among other things, intelligence provided by CIA assets, true names of assets, operational meeting locations and phone numbers, and information about covert facilities."Mr. Lee served as a CIA officer and was entrusted with extremely sensitive national security information, and he broke that trust with no regard for the consequences," said John Brown, Assistant Director of Counterintelligence for the FBI. "His actions aided a foreign government, hurt our national security, and jeopardized the safety of his former intelligence colleagues. The FBI takes such acts of betrayal very seriously and will be relentless in pursuing these cases. I want to thank the agents, analysts, and prosecutors who worked tirelessly to bring Mr. Lee to justice.""Lee betrayed his own country for greed and put his former colleagues at risk. The seriousness of his betrayal and crime is demonstrated by today's sentencing," said Timothy R. Slater, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office. "The FBI and our partners will continue to aggressively pursue those who put our nation's security in danger to benefit our adversaries. The U.S. government will not stand by while the Chinese intelligence service targets our government employees for their gain and to the detriment of U.S. national security."During 2012, Lee had a series of interviews with the CIA. Throughout these interviews, in response to questions about what the IOs had wanted from him, Lee intentionally failed to disclose that he had received taskings from them. In May 2013, the FBI conducted multiple interviews with Lee. During one of those interviews, Lee admitted that he had received taskings but stated that he had not kept the written requests because they would tend to incriminate him.The FBI interviewers also confronted Lee with the sensitive document discovered on the thumb drive. Lee falsely denied that he possessed it, claimed not to know who created it, and denied knowing why it would have been on his computer. He also denied deleting the document. Approximately one week later, in another FBI interview, Lee admitted that he created the document in response to two taskings from the IOs and transferred it to a thumb drive. He also said he thought about giving it to the IOs but never did.In a January 2018 interview with the FBI, Lee falsely denied that he ever kept any work-related notes at home. When shown a photocopy of the front covers of the day planner and address book described above, as well as a copy of his handwriting therein, Lee falsely denied that he possessed the notebooks while transiting through Hawaii in August 2012. Lee also falsely denied that either of the books contained notes from asset meetings but conceded that any such notes would be classified. Further, Lee falsely denied that he ever put the sensitive document on a thumb drive, notwithstanding the fact that he had admitted having done so when interviewed by FBI agents in May 2013. Finally, Lee also falsely told the interviewing agents that in drafting this document he was writing down things "more [like] a diary thing," notwithstanding the fact that in May 2013 he had told FBI agents that he had created the document in response to two taskings from the Chinese IOs.Lee pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deliver national defense information to aid a foreign government on May 1.John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Timothy R. Slater, Assistant Director of the FBI's Washington Field Office, made the announcement of the sentencing by Senior U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III. Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil Hammerstrom and Trial Attorneys Patrick T. Murphy and Adam L. Small of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section prosecuted the case with assistance from Assistant U.S. Attorney Inayat Delawala.

Huawei to sue over FCC restrictions on USF spending - reportFierceWirelessDecember 2, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 720 wordsByline: Bevin FletcherHighlight: Huawei is preparing to launch a legal battle against a recent FCC ruling that bars U.S. carriers from using government subsidies to purchase the Chinese vendor's telecom equipment or services, according to a Wall Street Journal report. BodyHuawei is preparing to launch a legal battle against a recent Federal Communications Commission ruling that bars U.S. carriers from using government subsidies to purchase the Chinese vendor's telecom equipment or services, according to a Wall Street Journal report.Huawei intends to file a lawsuit challenging that decision this week in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, announcing the move at a press conference at its Shenzhen headquarters, sources familiar with the matter told the WSJ.Huawei did not immediately respond to FierceWireless request for comment.RELATED: FCC bans use of USF funds for Huawei, ZTE equipmentThe FCC voted unanimously on Nov. 22 ban Universal Service Fund (USF) dollars for telecom gear from vendors that posenational security risks, specifically calling out Huawei and fellow Chinese vendor ZTE as companies subject to the rule.In its response to the FCC ruling, Huawei previously released a statement that in part said: “Huawei believes this order is unlawful as the FCC has singled out Huawei based on national security, but it provides no evidence that Huawei poses a security risk. Instead, the FCC simply assumes, based on a mistaken view of Chinese law, that Huawei might come under Chinese government control."The government's USF provides about $8.5 billion in annual subsidies for broadband deployment primarily in underserved areas, and carriers impacted by the ruling are mainly smaller rural providers.The U.S. previously flagged Huawei as a national security risk, asserting the vendor could be used to spy for the Chinese government. The U.S. has also actively campaigned for allies around the world to keep Huawei out of 5G networks. Huawei has continuously denied all allegations, and in its earlier statement criticized the FCC's method of designating it a security threat. “The FCC's process for labeling Huawei a security threat violates bedrock principles of due process, and is based on nothing more than irrational speculation and innuendo,” Huawei's statement said.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in his prepared remarks during the commission vote said the actions were taken “based on evidence in the record, as well as longstanding concerns from the executive and legislative branches about the national security threats posed by certain foreign communications equipment manufacturers, most particularly Huawei and ZTE.”RELATED: Rural carriers get another 90-day extension to work with Huawei“These concerns are by no means hypothetical,” continued Pai. “This summer, for example, an independent cybersecurity firm found that over half of the Huawei firmware images they analyzed had at least one potential backdoor, and that each Huawei device they tested had an average of 102 known vulnerabilities."Huawei for its part called the actions “unwarranted,” saying it “will have profound negative effects on connectivity for Americans in rural and underserved areas across the United States.”At its November meeting, the FCC also adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposes a process for removal and replacement of Huawei gear that already exists within U.S. networks.If Huawei's reported lawsuit happens, it would not be the first time Huawei took legal action against the United States for imposing restrictions on its telecom gear. In March, Huawei filed a lawsuit in Texas against the U.S. government, challenging a section of the recent National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that banned federal agencies from Huawei products.In that case, Huawei sought a declaratory judgment, asserting the law's restrictions targeting Huawei are unconstitutional, and requested a permanent injunction.As in the FCC ruling, ZTE was also singled out by the NDAA, which was signed into law in August 2018.ZTE has not released a statement in response to the recent FCC decision or responded to questions about whether it intends to fight the ban. Huawei is also at the center of U.S.-China trade tensions, and in May was essentially blacklisted by the U.S. Department of Commerce from sourcing certain U.S.-made technology without government approval. One day ahead of the FCC decision, Reuters reported that the U.S. had            started granting licenses to some companies, including Microsoft, to export certain software and components to Huawei. Load-Date: December 2, 2019End of Document

RADIO INTERVIEW WITH NEIL MITCHELL, 3AWStates News ServiceNovember 1, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 3958 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: CANBERRA, Australia BodyThe following information was released by the office of the Prime Minister of Australia:NEIL MITCHELL: Scott Morrison, good morning.PRIME MINISTER: Good morning, Neil, good to be back.MITCHELL: Well, thank you for your time. I've read the speech you're delivering today and we've had massive disruption in this town by protesters over a couple of weeks. You've promising to take them on. You accuse them of economic sabotage and said you want to outlaw, quote, 'Indulgent and selfish practices'. How? What can you do?PRIME MINISTER: Well, we've already taken action against their cousins who wanted to invade farms and we put legislation through to protect our farmers from that type of economic vandalism. And there's, of course, a right to protest in this country. But I think they're really starting to push the envelope with where we've got reports of people getting spat at just because they're wearing a business shirt on their way to work in Melbourne. This is, I think, getting well beyond the pale. And so, look, you know, we're looking at the options that we have there. There's also the broader issue of what I'm seeing in secondary boycotts have been effectively put in place through this type of activism, just targeting decent small businesses who are providing services to the mining industry. And they're being black banned and they're being harassed. And this is not something that any Australian should have to put up with. So by all means, people have a right to protest. But, you know, we live in a country where we should respect each other and try and disagree a little better than what we're seeing on display there.MITCHELL: Would you like to make secondary boycotts or bans like that illegal?PRIME MINISTER: Well, these are things we're looking very carefully at. I'm flagging that today. I mean, we need to progress, I think, cautiously. But if it's not okay to have secondary boycotts being run by unions and we get rid of those a long time ago, it's not okay for environmental... well they're not environmental, they're activist groups. That's what they are. And to be able to disrupt people's jobs, their livelihoods and to harass in the way that we've seen down in Melbourne, it's just... it's ugly. And I don't think it's good for our country.MITCHELL: Would you look at permits to protest?PRIME MINISTER: Look, those are things that the state governments, I think... I mean, they control those sorts of issues. What I'm talking about is the injury that is being done to people's businesses and deliberately and wilfully, which is the same thing we saw from those who were organising the protests on people's farms. And we've put laws in place to deal with that. And so I'm simply signalling that I think Australians respect and understand the right to protest, it's part of our democracy. But we also expect each other to behave in a way that also isn't seeking to injure fellow Australians, particularly their jobs.MITCHELL: But how do you draw the line? How do you define it? You won't march on the road and block intersections? You won't fight with police? I mean, how do you define it?PRIME MINISTER: I'm not talking about those issues, they're matters for state governments. What I'm talking about is the injury that is done to people's businesses by secondary boycotts being run by these anarchist groups. And the victims, they're basically targeting people's businesses and trying to drive them out of business simply because they're contracting to legitimate lawful resources companies who create a lot of jobs, particularly in regional Australia. I mean, the first people to turn up when I went up to north Queensland and the floods were on out in west Queensland were the mining companies with their equipment to help them remove the carcasses. So, I mean, they're a very important industry. I respect the right to protest, but people have got to respect other Australians too when they do it.MITCHELL: So just finally, what's your timeframe when you would look to introduce legislation on this?PRIME MINISTER: Well, I don't have one at the moment. The Industrial Relations Minister and the Attorney-General and I are working on these issues. I'm careful about how I go forward on these things, Neil. The vegan farmers laws, as you know, went through the Parliament and that's happened in the last few months. And so we'll continue to move on this one. I'm just making it pretty clear that this type of behaviour, secondary boycotting companies just going about their business, is not on.MITCHELL: Prime Minister, something else. You're fond of saying - and I usually agree with you - how good is Australia? But in two days you've had two reports. One shows we're desperately failing the mentally ill, a million people untreated, no room for suicide people in care. Today, aged care and the Royal Commission calls it 'cruel and harmful; diminishing Australia; needs urgent action'. How can you say 'how good is Australia' when you have those sort of reports?PRIME MINISTER: Well, look, Australia is always a great country. And the reason that we can initiate, as I did one of my first acts as Prime Minister - a Royal Commission into this, is one of the reasons we are a good country. Because we're prepared to acknowledge where we get things wrong, not buck pass. My initiative here was to get this Royal Commission so we could get this rather shocking and very difficult to read information. I mean, we all have connections, personal, into those who need this care. And it doesn't matter whether they're your family or not your family, they should all have the same type of standard of care right across the country. And so we do need to acknowledge what's coming forth in the Royal Commission...MITCHELL: But it doesn't fix it. I understand you initiated and you said it would be difficult and you're right. But exposing it doesn't fix it. We need to fix it. Specifically.PRIME MINISTER: That's the start of the process, we need the Royal Commission and now they haven't come forward with recommendations yet.MITCHELL: Well, yes, they have, they said they want immediate funding in home care.PRIME MINISTER: They did, they haven't made recommendations but they've highlighted those three things in particular. One is the need for more in-home aged care.MITCHELL: They said immediate funding, will they get it?PRIME MINISTER: What I was about to tell you is that we will be making a response on those issues before the end of the year. One of the reasons I've been waiting for this report is because I wanted that to inform the final decisions we were going to make around in-home aged care funding before we finalise the mid-year update. I spoke again to the Treasurer, the Finance Minister, last night and the Minister, Richard Colbeck. We have been looking for that input from the Royal Commission to inform this next set of decisions. It's one of the reasons, Neil, I'm so careful about our spending in the Budget, because I've been saying for some time now that we knew we would need to address issues coming out of this Royal Commission on aged care. That's why I initiated it in the first place so we could know what we needed to do and confront that. The other two things that I've seen come out of this, there's also the issues around the overmedication...MITCHELL: The chemical restraint, yep.PRIME MINISTER: The chemical restraint. And there have already been some things that's been done in all these areas. But there's so much more to do, which is what the Royal Commission is highlighting. And there's a seventh pharmacy agreement which is underway now. I saw the pharmacists last night, actually, and we talked very briefly about that issue. There's a process with states and territories. And then there's the issue of younger people.MITCHELL: Yeah, 6000 young disabled people in nursing homes.PRIME MINISTER: Well, it's fallen from 6,200 to 5,600 over the last two years. But there's so much more to go. One of the other things I did when I first became Prime Minister, I came up here to Brisbane, where there's an amazing organisation called Youngcare, and they actually build homes for young people with serious disabilities so they don't have to go into aged care facilities. And we need more of that model to support how they do their work. So all of these three things, I couldn't agree with more. We've got to acknowledge the problem. We know there's a lot more work to do and we've got to create a new culture of respect for older Australians, which is what I said when we first announced this. I think that's at the heart of what the report says.MITCHELL: I agree. But there's an urgent problem here. You say you'll have decisions by the end of the year. Will money be spent? Will money being available by the end of the year?PRIME MINISTER: Yes.MITCHELL: How much?PRIME MINISTER: Well, I'll announce it once we've gone through that process.MITCHELL: So it is that urgent? You'll have money out there by Christmas?PRIME MINISTER: Yes.MITCHELL: Is profit motive part of the problem here?PRIME MINISTER: Look, whether it's... I mean, let's go back to where this all started with the aged care facility in South Australia. It was a publicly run one. I mean, it doesn't matter whether it's public, private or not for profit. We have seen abuses and we're seeing substandard care across all fields. So, I mean, you've got to address the issues in each of those sectors.MITCHELL: Mental health, will there be money for that as well? A million Australians not getting treatment are needed.PRIME MINISTER: Well, we've already acted in the last Budget. We put over $750 million into that. As you know, we put additional resources into headspaces around the country and with our towards zero suicides adviser who's working right across government. She's bringing forward to me at the moment a whole series of proposals based on the work that she's doing. The mental health of our nation is critical. And the Health Minister has been talking with the states just in today and in recent days about a new agreement that can go around mental health. On mental health I think we've been sort of getting more on the front foot on this. It's certainly been a priority that I've placed. And it's everything from supporting, you know, great organisations like Batyr, which is an organisation that goes into schools and helps young people understand how to deal with anxiety and the help available to them. But it also extends to putting support in for people in our rural communities who are dealing with the drought where we've upped the funding there too, but more resource needed there. That's why we need a strong Budget.MITCHELL: Well, can I raise a couple of other quick issues? The economy, the economy. And you talk about money and the need to spend money. Isn't it time to put the surplus as less of a priority? And look, did you see Shayne Elliott from the ANZ yesterday said we're not in recession, technically, but people feel like they're in a recession. They are hurting so much.PRIME MINISTER: That's why we want the banks to lend.MITCHELL: Well, yeah, but what about the surplus? Are you irrevocably linked to a surplus?PRIME MINISTER: We're linked to responsible fiscal management.MITCHELL: Well, that doesn't necessarily mean a surplus.PRIME MINISTER: Well, what it means is having clear priorities about where you're going to put your funds. And that's aged care, that's mental health, that's supporting the drought and these are the priorities, and it's supporting our veterans.MITCHELL: I agree. Does that mean that you will forgo a surplus if necessary?PRIME MINISTER: It means we will honour all of those priorities. And I believe the two of them can be achieved together.MITCHELL: You can still get a surplus? What about stimulating the economy? What about those people who are hurting so much?PRIME MINISTER: Well, this stimulus idea last time involved sending cheques to dead people. And it was an absolute waste of taxpayers funds.MITCHELL: Well, you can do it better than that. Do you accept what Shayne Elliot is saying that people are hurting? People feel we're in a recession.PRIME MINISTER: I've always accepted that. That's why we've had budgets that have delivered record levels of tax relief to Australians. That's why we're bringing forward infrastructure projects, including in Victoria. I mean, a lot of the work since the election, in particular. I've just been sitting down with Dan Andrews. We've met on numerous occasions now, just getting projects brought forward, ones that we can move quicker or providing additional support. The last time we spoke we were talking about the Monash Freeway, getting these projects moving more quickly. And I genuinely appreciate the support I've had from the Victorian Government to achieve that. So tax relief and infrastructure spending are things that are already happening. It's not like there's not investment going into these things. There is record investment.MITCHELL: No, fair enough. But just to be clear, the surplus remains a priority? The surplus will continue?PRIME MINISTER: Yeah, of course it does, because that's important for our resilience to the future. You can go and blow the Budget now on ineffective measures and that just reduces your ability to support mental health and veterans and aged care. Because the aged care, there'll be an immediate response, which is what I was referring to when you asked me a second ago. But there's also a medium and long term response which will have to prepare for as we go into next year's Budget and the Budget after that.MITCHELL: Prime Minister, we broadcast to regional Victoria. Parts of Victoria are hit by drought as badly as some other parts of the country. I just want to play you something, Judy Collingburn runs a small drought aid operation in northern Victoria. I asked her what the message was for you.[EXCERPT]JUDY COLLINGBURN: Do something about it. The farmers are really suffering. Like, the Darling River, you know, is bone dry and the farmers up there have got no water. And, you know, the new bit of water they've got they can't use it because it's so rank. He's got to do something. Small towns along the Darling River started dying and farmers are just going to walk off their land. And it's just... it's devastating and it's upsetting. We go up and see the farmers and just see... you can see it in their faces. It's just astronomical. And Mr Morrison needs to do something.MITCHELL: Can you offer them any hope, Prime Minister?PRIME MINISTER: Well, we can offer the support that we've been delivering and we're increasing it. I mean, not including the Future Drought Fund, there is around $2.5 billion of support. Now, if you're on the Farm Household Allowance, which we've eased up and eased up on all the restrictions and assessments as to how people can access it, that will over a four year period give you $125,000 per farming family. And just last, just a couple of weeks ago, we included another $13,000 additional payment, supplement payment, on those issues. The response has three parts. There's the direct financial assistance through things like Farm Household Allowance. We've given over $60 million to groups like the Salvos and Vinnies to provide $3,000 emergency payments for people in these towns to support them with bills and put food on the table. Then there's the programme of putting a million dollars into all of these Shires so they can keep the local economies moving and ensure we're getting those people on jobs. On the farms, we've provided rebate assistance for work they're doing on the farms so the farmhands can continue to get work on those farms, on doing stuff like piping or doing dog fences up in Queensland or doing work on turkey nests and things like that. And then, of course, there's the longer-term water infrastructure projects, which is part of our National Water Grid. But there's serious money going into those new dam works, 21 projects all around the country right now.MITCHELL: Ok, just quickly on something else. Can you just explain to me in very simple terms...PRIME MINISTER: Can I just stress on that, Neil, there'll be more to come too. It's not set and forget, there'll be more assistance and we'll have more to say about that soon.MITCHELL: By Christmas as well?PRIME MINISTER: Yes.MITCHELL: Ok. Where do we stand on the continuing Uyghur concentration camps in China? I'm confused. I mean, Australia has been very strongly criticised out of China today. Where do... what is the Australian Government attitude on these concentration camps?PRIME MINISTER: Well, we've been very consistent and both the Foreign Minister and I and the Trade Minister and others, we've just consistently raised our concerns about these issues directly with the Chinese government and that has been included in working together with other countries...MITCHELL: Do we believe they're immoral?PRIME MINISTER: Well, you've seen the pictures. I mean, it's fairly straightforward. I mean, we've raised these issues as great human rights abuses and concerns. We've done it directly. We haven't just done it in public. We've always raised these issues consistently and the Foreign Minister has done this on every occasion she's had. And, you know, the thing about our relationship with China is it has to be an honest one. It has to be a transparent one. And we just have to act consistently with our values, which is what we're doing. The Chinese government will make their comments about what they believe is occurring there. And we'll continue with other countries around the world to raise the concerns that we have.MITCHELL: The Chinese say, they've lodged 'stern representations with Australia about this'. Have they?PRIME MINISTER: They've made various statements and when I've raised matters myself and the Foreign Minister has raised they have their view about what's occurring there and they are obviously a part of that relationship entitled to raise those matters directly with us. But it's not something that I seek to have define our relationship. I mean, the relationship is defined on the things you agree on, not the things you disagree on. But it's important that, you know, Australians understand that we'll always act consistently with our values. And we'll do it in a very consistent way.MITCHELL: Have you told the Victorian Premier that signing up to the Belt and Road agreement - he took the second step recently in China - is not a good idea?PRIME MINISTER: We said that at the time.MITCHELL: What's he compromising here? What's he doing?PRIME MINISTER: Look, you'd have to ask him.MITCHELL: No, no, no. But, you know, he signed it. You know, you've had advice not to sign it. What is he risking?PRIME MINISTER: Well, we haven't been part of that project. And for a start, foreign affairs is actually run by the Commonwealth Government. I'm not about to come and run the Victorian police force.MITCHELL: But haven't you got advice not to be part of it?PRIME MINISTER: We have chosen not to be part of that initiative.MITCHELL: Why?PRIME MINISTER: ...individual companies have. Well, these are sensitive matters and all of that. And they're not ones that I tend to go into public commentary about.MITCHELL: So you've got advice not to be part of it for reasons you won't explain? Which I can understand.PRIME MINISTER: I'll just give the same answer I gave you, Neil.MITCHELL: Fair enough. All right, just finally, China embraces censorship. And we've got this campaign for the 'right to know' here. And it's a simple one, a silly one, perhaps highlights it. Can you explain to me - and I can understand threats to national security and everything - how being told what taxpayers are paying Scott Cam to promote apprenticeships is a threat to national security? Why does that have to be secret?PRIME MINISTER: It's not about national security, it's about a commercial-in-confidence relationship in the same way you have commercial-in-confidence relationships with any number of different suppliers. You have it over infrastructure projects. You have it over any number of commercial arrangements. It's just that's a protection that's provided to individual Australians that their own commercial arrangements aren't exposed.MITCHELL: So you don't think the public deserves to know where their money's going?PRIME MINISTER: Well, we're bound by a commercial-in-confidence arrangement, which is contractual.MITCHELL: You didn't have to sign it.PRIME MINISTER: Your companies you work for and others do a similar thing...MITCHELL: But I'm not paid by the taxpayer.PRIME MINISTER: Well, there are a lot of companies that do business with the government who seek those commercial-in-confidence arrangements. It's not a new practice. It's quite a longstanding one.MITCHELL: Can you negotiate a way through this? You've got every media organisation in the country concerned about the right to know, about suppression of information, about raids on journalists.PRIME MINISTER: Well, I'd make a couple of points. The first one is we've got the inquiry, which has gone over to the Joint Standing Committee, which is looking at that. I'll wait for that to come back before taking any further action there. The second thing we've done is that the Home Affairs Minister has given a clear directive to the Federal Police, which both codifies what our expectations are about how they pursue these things, as well as providing, I think, some better processes about how they make decisions about what they do. And I stress, the Government doesn't tell the AFP where they go or what do.MITCHELL: But won't the Minister have the power of veto?PRIME MINISTER: That was the third I was going to come to. In many areas, the Attorney-General has those powers and they were extended in this actually to protect press freedoms. I mean, what happens under that is that the AFP would have initiated the investigation. The prosecutor would want to actually come and prosecute a journalist and under this arrangement, the Attorney-General would be able to prevent that from happening at the end of the process. But if the journalists would like him not to have that power and allow the prosecutors to just proceed, well, that could be done.MITCHELL: Don't you see the danger in that? I mean, Daniel Andrews would have me prosecuted tomorrow if he could. Somebody else might not. I mean, why do, when you have a politician making these sort of decisions? It's obviously dangerous.PRIME MINISTER: I think, with great respect, Neil, I think you're misrepresenting the process. The Attorney-General is not initiating anything. What is initiated is by the law enforcement agency...MITCHELL: But he's got the power of veto.PRIME MINISTER: Well, that's only to stop it proceeding.MITCHELL: Yeah, Ok.PRIME MINISTER: The power is to stop the prosecution, not to not to allow it, not to initiate it. I mean, the prosecutor comes to the Attorney-General and says, we would like to prosecute person X, and the Attorney-General has the ability under that arrangement to say no. If he says nothing, then they prosecute.MITCHELL: I thank you for your time. If we go much longer, your office will never speak to me again.PRIME MINISTER: Always happy to chat.MITCHELL: Hey, you're not coming to the Cup, are you? You working on Tuesday?PRIME MINISTER: I am. Yeah. And I won't be able to get down there, but I'm sure I'll catch it like everybody else somewhere around the country.MITCHELL: So it's not a Taylor Swift boycott, isn't it?[Laughter]PRIME MINISTER: No, I love Taylor Swift. I think she's fantastic.MITCHELL: Thank you very much. The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. Sadly, she doesn't love the Melbourne Cup.

3 Leveraged Emerging Markets Traders Should Consider in Q1Benzinga.comDecember 17, 2019 Tuesday 3:55 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 644 wordsByline: ETF ProfessorBodyInternational stocks will again lag their U.S. rivals in 2019, but that could change in 2020. That means the stage could be set for marquee ex-US benchmarks, such as the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, to rally in the first quarter.If an international equity market rally materializes in the first quarter, active traders may want to consider leveraged exchange-traded funds to capture added upside. International stocks are poised for a 2020 comeback to some degree, they ve been beaten up due to lack of economic growth, strong dollar, trade war and other factors,  said Direxion Managing Director Sylvia Jablonski.  However, world banks began strong stimulus, and we are seeing some of the manufacturing hits and slowdown, relent. If we see a trade resolution, this further boosts the argument. While the US has outperformed International and EM for the past decade, with US valuations at all-time highs, investors would like to find some new ideas. Those may come in the form of broad-based international and emerging markets exposure, and also sector-specific, in places like China. With that in mind, here are a few leveraged emerging markets ETFs traders may want to consider at the start of the new year.Direxion Daily MSCI Emerging Markets Bull 3X Shares (EDC)The Direxion Daily MSCI Emerging Markets Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: EDC) looks to deliver triple the daily returns of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. That index has recently shown signs of life, jumping almost 4% this month.Recent data suggest fund managers have been stepping into developing world equities and there are other reasons to consider EDC for a quick trade in the first quarter. Accommodative fed and investors searching for yield might drive em stocks. Asia and India in particular are reinvesting into their respective economies,  said Jablonski.  Chinese stocks should benefit from china financial liberalization and increased weighting of A-shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Direxion Daily CSI China Internet Bull 2X Shares (CWEB)The Direxion Daily CSI China Internet Index Bull 2X Shares (NYSE: CWEB) is the first leveraged ETF dedicated to Chinese internet stocks, making the fund a potentially potent play on an asset class that often delivers sizable returns even without leverage. CWEB attempts to deliver double the daily returns of the CSI Overseas China Internet Index.CWEB is a play on Chinese consumer and technology trends, themes that should have some reduced near-term risk now that the U.S. and China have come to terms on Phase I of a trade pact. Automation and tech: China now has the biggest amount of installed robots   and the biggest R&D spend so the semiconductor, tech, AI and robotics space may grow- look to an ETF like CWEB that gives you access to companies like Alibaba that reflect consumer spending,  notes Jablonski.Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2X Shares (CHAU)The Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2X Shares (NYSE: CHAU), which seeks daily returns that are double those of the CSI 300 Index, could be an ideal play for traders looking to capitalize on Beijing's efforts to keep the domestic economy sturdy.CHAU could prove increasingly relevant over the near-term because the Chinese government is never shy about propping up the economy there. Chinese government is likely to continue stimulus measures that boost assets,  said Jablonski.  Rate cutting is likely. Policy support rolled out at the end of 2018 is just starting to hit the economy and those measures include monetary policy easing, tax cuts and supply-side reforms. Also, as real-estate and development is experiencing a boom, we might see that trickle down to the economy.  Related LinksSaudi Oil Giant Will be in These ETFs3 Great Small-Cap ETFs Show Advertiser Disclosure © 2019 Benzinga.com.

Global Fuel Card Market to 2027 - Leveraging Telematics with the Adoption of Fuel CardsPR NewswireDecember 5, 2019 Thursday 6:15 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 796 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Dec. 5, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Fuel Card Market to 2027 - Global Analysis and Forecasts By Type; Application"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The global fuel card market is estimated to account to US$ 6.29 Bn in 2018 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period 2019 - 2027, to account to US$ 10.39 Bn by 2027.The increasing penetration of digitization in various industries, including logistics and transportation, is driving the demand for efficient and transparent payment solutions. In addition to this, the changing consumer preferences and increasing technological shifts are the two major factors that are driving the paradigm shift in global payments and cards industry.The rising penetration of mobile phones has led customers to embrace mobile and in-app payment methods over the traditional payment methods. This trend of using alternative payment methods over traditional ones is anticipated to drive the adoption of fuel cards in North America.Various governments in this region are formulating policies to attract foreign direct investments (FDIs) in the technology sector with the increasing demand for enhanced digital services from customers. For instance, China's government relaxed the restrictions on new entries with an objective to encourage overseas and private capital investments in their economy. In the digital landscape, the Chinese government is very keen to maintain its stronghold and competitiveness through initiatives such as Industry 4.0, Made in China 2025, and Internet Plus.Australia has also taken initiatives to promote digital transformation of various industries with announcement of Digital Transformation Strategy'. Over the past three years, Australia had delivered some transformational new services such as Airport SmartGates, myTax and Medicare which focused on transforming traditional services into digital services. This strategy lays a roadmap to 2025. Increasing tech savvy population, rising investments in digital solutions by enterprises and favorable government policies to promote digitization are some of the major factors that are expected to drive the demand of fuel cards in the Asia Pacific region.The fuel card market has been segmented based on type, application, and geography. Based on type, the fuel card market has been segmented into branded fuel cards, merchant fuel cards, and universal fuel cards. In 2018, the universal fuel cards segment contributed a substantial share in the global fuel card market. The merchant branded fuel cards segment is anticipated to grow at a rapid CAGR of 6.6% during the forecast period. The fuel card market is further segmented on the basis application into fuel refill, parking, vehicle service, toll charge, and others.Key Topics Covered:1.

Treasury futures saw very limited overnight movement due to reduced participation associated with market closures in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and across Europe. Treasury futures inched above Tuesday's closing levels around 3:30 ET, but that uptick was reversed in recent trade. Today's session will feature a $32 bln 7-yr Treasury note auction, which will follow Tuesday's strong 5-yr note sale. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 97.69.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +13.90.The S&P 500 futures trade three points, or 0.1%, above fair value on this post-Christmas session. The positive sentiment in the market continues to persist, perhaps due to the lack of market-moving news this morning.There are some positive considerations to at least consider, though. Holiday retail sales increased 3.4% (ex-auto) with online sales growing 18.8% compared to 2018, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. China purchased 2.56 million tons of U.S. soybeans in November versus 1.15 million in October, according to Reuters.

Huawei's response to Wall Street Journal claimsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 26, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 537 wordsBodyChinese tech giant Huawei Technologies filed a lawful statement on an article published by The Wall Street Journal, which says five points, that the information this US newspaper handles about the company, specializing in research and development, electronic production and marketing, is totally false.1. The article published by The Wall Street Journal is based on false information and poor reasoning. This article speculates on how Huawei has become what it is today. However, the truth is that Huawei's success is the result of our 30 years of strong investment in R&D;, our focus on customer needs and the dedication of our more than 190,000 employees. The Wall Street Journal is a professional media outlet, so we need to question its motives and purpose in publishing this article.2. Huawei is a private company exclusively owned by its employees. In the last 30 years, we have invested 10% to 15% of our annual R&D; revenue. Our R&D; investment over the past decade amounts to nearly $73 billion. In 2018 alone, our R&D; investment reached US$15 billion, making Huawei the fifth largest global investment in R&D; according to the 2018 EU Industrial R&D; Investment Scoreboard. That puts Huawei well above Cisco, Nokia and Ericsson, which ranked 25th, 27th and 43rd, respectively. From 2009 to 2019, Huawei has invested more than $4 billion in 5G. This is more than the total 5G investment of all major equipment suppliers in the United States and Europe combined. Such a strong investment in R&D; has driven Huawei's innovation and development, and is a key factor behind the company's success.3. Huawei's relationship with the Chinese government is no different from that of any other private company operating in China. Like other technology companies operating in China, including those abroad, Huawei receives some political support from the Chinese government. But we have never received any additional or special treatment. Our working capital comes mainly from our own business operations and external financing rather than government subsidies. In the last 10 years, 90% of our working capital comes from our business operations. Huawei's external financing follows all market rules, and our debt cost aligns with market standards.4. The fact is that every technology company operating in China is entitled to certain government subsidies, provided that they meet certain conditions. This includes technology companies coming from abroad. Subsidies granted to technology companies are mainly used to support research programs. Huawei requests these government subsidies just like any other company. As the article itself said, it is also common for Western governments to offer subsidies to support technology research programs. Over the past decade, the total amount Huawei received in R&D; subsidies from governments both inside and outside China amounted to less than 0.3% of our total revenue. In 2018, we only receive an amount equal to 0.2% of our annual income.5. Recently, The Wall Street Journal published a series of articlesfalse and irresponsible about Huawei. These items have seriously damaged the company's reputation. Huawei reserves the right to take legal action to protect our reputation.Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

Robert Casey Jr., D-Pennsylvania, issued the following news release:* * *- Senator Secures Key Resources For PA Children, Families & Seniors* * *Despite rancor and gridlock, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) is finishing 2019 having successfully fought on behalf of his constituents. Senator Casey's 2019 work includes securing miners' pensions and health care, working to phase out the use of dangerous PFAS chemicals and modernizing the regulation of over-the-counter drugs.Below is a list of Senator Casey's 2019 work on behalf of Pennsylvania constituents.Fighting for Jobs and a Secure Retirement* Retirement and Health Security for Pennsylvania's Miners: The Bipartisan American Miners Act, S.2788, which Senator Casey co-authored, was included in the 2019 end-of-year funding agreement. This legislation secures the pensions for 11,550 Pennsylvanians and the healthcare for 2,070 Pennsylvanians and their families. Enactment of this legislation is a culmination of over half a decade of work. This legislation includes provisions to shore up the 1974 Pension Plan, which is headed for insolvency due to coal company bankruptcies and the 2008 financial crisis. It would also ensure that miners, whose healthcare is at risk due to 2018 and 2019 coal company bankruptcies, will not lose their health benefits.* Passage of CHARITY Act Provision to Simplify the Foundation Excise Tax: A CHARITY Act, S.1475 (Thune-Casey-Wyden), provision to simplify the excise tax on foundations was included in the 2019 end-of-year funding agreement. The provision simplifies the private foundation excise tax at a single rate of 1.39 percent, at no cost to taxpayers. This simplification eliminates the current, two-tiered system that inhibited foundations from increasing grantmaking during times of need, such as a recession.* Central Focus on the Economic Challenges Facing Workers and Families: Senator Casey worked to secure broad Democratic Caucus support to expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. This legislation was included in the House Ways and Means-passed Economic Mobility Act of 2019, H.R.3300. The cost of child care has increased by 25 percent over the past decade, creating significant financial strain for middle-class families. This bill would provide significant support to help all working families cover the cost of childcare.* Enhance Taxpayer Access to Information about Tax Scams: Two provisions proposed by Senator Casey were incorporated in HR 3151, the Taxpayer First Act, enacted into law as Public Law 116-25.- Section 1406 directs IRS/Treasury to provide useful information to taxpayers about common scams and how to report scams, including information about common tax scams, information on where and how to report tax scams and advice on how taxpayers can protect themselves from identity theft and tax scams.- Section 7529 (B)(C): Many Americans don't realize that when tax fraud is discovered these crimes are not automatically reported and referred to law enforcement. Section 7529 (B)(C) includes a directive to IRS and Treasury to provide the information taxpayers need to report tax-related identity theft. Often times these crimes don't go reported because (1) victims assume the IRS is investigating and (2) don't know what information needs to be provided. Because taxpayer information is protected, law enforcement cannot investigate tax fraud without explicit permission from a taxpayer.Promoting Economic Development for Pennsylvania Communities* Appalachian Development Highway System: Senator Casey helped to secure $100 million in funding for the Appalachian Development Highway System. This is new money is designated for the completion of the ADHS system. Pennsylvania will likely get a large portion of this, which could, for example, be used to complete Route 219 in Somerset County.* Lower Mon Project: Senator Casey advocated for additional funding for the Lower Mon Project in Western Pennsylvania, securing $111 million. The locks and dams on the Monongahela River are old and failure would dramatically impact commerce in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Obtaining this funding is critical upgrading the Western PA inland waterway system.* Nuclear Power Plant Closures: The year-end appropriations bill also includes $15 million through the Department of Commerce to support communities dealing with the closure of a nuclear power plant. It is anticipated that this funding will be used to assist the area around Three Mile Island.Fighting to Combat Hunger Among Children* Introduction of Child Nutrition Priorities: Senator Casey introduced several bills aimed at expanding access to healthy food for children in the Senate Agriculture Committee's upcoming Child Nutrition Reauthorization. Senators Casey and Collins introduced their bipartisan Wise Investment in Children (WIC) Act to expand nutrition access for children and mothers. Additionally, Senator Casey has introduced legislation to improve the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) as well as the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) in order to expand access to healthy food.* Advocated for the Protection of Hunger Assistance Programs: Senator Casey is fighting to protect critical nutrition assistance programs for our most vulnerable citizens. He continues to stand up against attacks to limit access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). He led a Pennsylvania delegation letter opposing the Administration's proposed rules and continues to speak out against proposals that threaten access to food for children and families and which are counter to the bipartisan agreement of the 2018 Farm Bill to protect SNAP. Senator Casey also led appropriations efforts to support funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), including increased support for TEFAP storage and distribution, as well as for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI), a program modeled after Pennsylvania's Fresh Food Financing Initiative.Standing Up For Veterans* Veterans Exposed to Toxic Substances: Casey has also played a role in supporting access to benefits for Veterans exposed to toxic substances during military service. This includes co-sponsorship of the Blue Water Navy Veterans Act (S. 1195), which passed in June 2019 and will ensure that Veterans exposed to Agent Orange while stationed on ships during the Vietnam war will receive presumptive coverage for related health effects. Senator Casey also supported passage of the Burn Pits Accountability Act via the NDAA to assess the health impacts of servicemembers' exposure to burn pits and lay the groundwork for presumptive coverage.* Exposed the VA for Abruptly Denying Access to Caregiver Program: After the review of data regarding participation in the VA Caregiver program, Senator Casey exposed the Department for abruptly terminating veterans from the program, prompting an internal review by the VA into policies and procedures for determining eligibility into the program.Protecting the Environment* Secured Funding for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed: Senator Casey joined the Chesapeake Bay delegation in working to secure increased funding for the Chesapeake Bay Program in the FY 2020 spending agreement. Senator Casey also wrote to USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service requesting that any carryover funding be directed to support additional on-farm conservation in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. Additionally, Senator Casey continues to build on wins from the 2018 Farm Bill for water quality by ensuring that programs are implemented to benefit the Bay and by providing outreach and information to farmers and partners who can utilize these programs.* PFAS Contamination: Senator Casey cosponsored the PFAS Action Act, which would require PFAS to be designated under the Superfund Act. He fought for inclusion of key PFAS provision in the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and led a delegation letter demanding interagency coordination between DoD, EPA and CDC to address PFAS contamination in PA. While the final NDAA did not include Superfund or drinking water provisions, it did include directions for the military to phase out the use of PFAS-based firefighting foam beginning in 2024, as well as other provisions related to PFAS remediation and study. Senator Casey led efforts to authorize and secure funding for a CDC study on the effects of PFAS on long-term health, and Pennsylvania's Bucks and Montgomery Counties were included in the multi-site study announced this year. Additionally, Senator Casey also helped secure PFAS remediation and base cleanup in the final FY 2020 appropriations legislation.* Preserved Public Lands in Pennsylvania: Senator Casey secured two measures in the Natural Resources Management Act (S.47) to establish the Susquehanna National Heritage Area in Lancaster and York counties and to provide a funding fix to ensure the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area in Pittsburgh remains able to receive federal funding. Further, provisions of the Oil Region National Heritage Area Reauthorization Act (S. 1265), which Senator Casey introduced, were included in the end of year spending deal, extending authorization through September 30, 2022. The extension of the region's status as a National Heritage Area will ensure that it can continue to benefit from the infusion of Federal, state and tourism dollars that come from a Heritage Area designation.Keeping Communities Safe and Our Judiciary Working* Nine District Court Judges Confirmed in Pennsylvania: Senator Casey has worked with Senator Toomey to confirm nine more Federal judges to the District Courts in PA. They include: Joshua Wolfson (EDPA); J. Nicholas Ranjan (WDPA); John Milton Young (EDPA); Stephanie Haines (WDPA); William Stickman (WDPA); Jennifer Wilson (MDPA); Rob Colville (WDPA); Karen Marston (EDPA); and John Gallagher (EDPA).* Community Oriented Policing Services: Senator Casey worked to secure additional funding for the COPS Program, which has been funded at $343 million for FY20, an increase of nearly $40 million more than the FY19 level. It will, among other things, place approximately 1,300 more police officers on the streets of our communities.* Combat Online Predators: Senator Casey worked with Senator Toomey to pass the Combat Online Predators Act in the Senate. This bipartisan bill was drafted in response to the traumatic experiences of a Pennsylvania family and will give judges additional tools to ensure that perpetrators who stalk or cyberstalk children are held accountable with serious penalties.Fighting Gun Violence* Federal Funding into Gun Violence: Senator Casey worked to secure $25 million in funding for gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. This is the first funding to study gun violence that has been allocated in over 20 years.Fighting for Health Care* Funding for the National Institutes of Health: The final FY2020 appropriations deal included an additional $2.6 billion for the National Institutes of Health, bringing the total NIH budget for FY 2020 to $41.5 billion. Pennsylvania researchers successfully compete for billions of dollars in NIH grants each year. Senator Casey leads the annual appropriations letter requesting robust funding for the NIH.* Health Care Oversight: Senator Casey has led efforts to expose and stop efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act. He released a report in the fall highlighting the ways in which the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are working to destroy, dismantle and defund the law. A link to the report can be found here.* Improved Health Care Consumer Protections by Cracking Down on False Online Advertisements: Following reports of false and misleading online advertisements for health insurance, Senator Casey conducted an investigation into the types of advertisements displayed to Pennsylvanians seeking to purchase affordable health care online. The investigative report documented the proliferation of advertisements falsely claiming to be HealthCare.gov. As a result of the investigation, Google agreed to remove the false advertisements.* Senate Passage of OTC Monograph Reform: In December the Senate passed the Over-the-Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act, landmark legislation to reform the Food and Drug Administration's authority to regulate non-prescription "over-the-counter" medications. This legislation addresses the outdated and inefficient monograph process, which FDA's own leadership and consumer advocates have highlighted as being in need of improvement.* Complex Manual Wheelchairs: Enacted into law S. 1223, the Protecting Beneficiary Access to Complex Rehab Technology Act, which Senator Casey introduced with Senator Portman to exempt complex rehab technology from competitive bidding pricing under Medicare. The provision exempts manual technology from bidding requirements to ensure that people with disabilities can retain access to complex rehab technology and accessories.* Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Program: Senator Casey, the Senate champion of the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) and author of several laws to extend and improve the program, secured additional funding for the program through the appropriations process. Funding for the program was increased by $15 million from $325 to $340 million for FY2020Helping Children Learn More Now So They Can Earn More Later* Early Childhood Development and Learning: Senator Casey is one of the Senate champions on early childhood education, leading his colleagues every year in seeking appropriations for Head Start and child care. This year, under his leadership, the FY 2020 Labor /HHS appropriations bill secured an increase of $1.1 billion for early learning, including $550 million for Head Start and $550 million for CCDBG.

It also collects information and reports to the Department about the status of college students with disabilities.* HBCU Permanent Funding: Congress passed permanent funding for minority-serving institutions, including HBCUs on December 10, 2019. President Trump signed the bill into law on December 19, 2019. Senator Casey worked with Senate Democrats to press Senate Republicans to stop blocking the funding, which had expired in September 2019. Senator Casey asked unanimous consent to take up and pass the FUTURE Act. He also signed letters urging quick passage of funding.Fighting the Administration's Immigration Cruelty* Care of Immigrant Children in U.S. Custody: At Senator Casey's request, The Government Accountability Office opened an investigation into the conditions and care of migrants, including children, in CBP custody. The report, expected in the spring of 2020, will analyze, among other things, the adequacy of current health protocols and screenings, as well as provide an analysis of how DHS has used supplemental funding slated for humanitarian purposes.Standing Up for Seniors* Groundbreaking Investigation into Under Performing Nursing Homes: Senator Casey conducted a groundbreaking investigation into underperforming nursing homes, which resulted in the first-ever release of a secret list, maintained by the Federal government, of the 400 of the poorest performing facilities. This list brought greater transparency to families seeking to find a home for a loved one and greater oversight and accountability to these facilities.* Spearheaded Efforts to Promote Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs: Senator Casey convened three hearings in the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging and participated in three hearings in the Senate Finance Committee related to the price of prescription drugs. He also introduced and supported legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs, allow for the importation of prescription drugs from countries like Canada, cap out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs for seniors, facilitate prescription drug price transparency, and enhance affordability for low-income seniors.* Secured $300,000 Funding to Support Grandfamilies: The Advisory Council to Support Grandparents Raising Grandchildren, which stems from Senator Casey's 2018 law, will continue to be able to meet in 2020 as a result of $300,000 in new funding which Casey obtained through the appropriations process. The council, which met for the first time in 2019, is tasked with developing a one-stop shop of resources to help grandparents raising grandchildren navigate federal, state and local programs and benefits.* Secured $246 million to Fight Senior Hunger: Senator Casey secured $246 million, an increase of $23 million in FY2020 to help fight senior hunger through the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, commonly known as the senior food box. This program provides shelf stable food to at-risk seniors. The new funding comes following the passage of Senator Casey's Nourishing Our Golden Years Act, which modernized the program in 2018.* Convened Advocates & Stakeholder in Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.: In an effort to highlight the voices of Pennsylvanians, Senator Casey convened conferences on issues of importance, including issues facing seniors and miners, in Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. These conferences fostered dialogue between advocates and elected officials with hundreds in attendance.Leading Efforts for Individuals with DisabilitiesSenate Casey continues to be the Senate's leader on disability rights, leading on a total of 19 disability policy bills covering education, health, employment, financial security, civil rights, disaster preparation and relief, veterans and social security. Eight of the bills had a Republican co-sponsor and 14 of the bills had a House companion.* Fighting Back on Untested Social Media Surveillance of People with Disabilities: In response to a letter from Senator Casey and Sen. Brown, the Social Security Administration agreed to stop any plans to implement social media monitoring of people receiving SSI or SSDI.* Seeking a Fair Wage for People with Disabilities: Senator Casey introduced legislation to eliminate the use of outdated subminimum wages that pay well below market rates for the labor of people with disabiliities. In furtherance of that effort, he also secured language in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill directing the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division to collect data on the number of individuals paid subminimum wage, the number of subminimum wage employers, the wages paid to their workers, and to provide a briefing to authorizing and appropriations staff on the findings.* Fighting Budget Cuts for Programs Serving People with Disabilities: Senator Casey led the fight in the Senate against proposed Trump Administration cuts to programs serving people with disabilities. Though proposed cuts to the Special Olympics, later rescinded under pressure, were the most visible, they were just one part of a broader assault on disability related funding.

Through the FY20 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), he secured a provision requiring the Department of Defense to provide training to academic research institutions and personnel on unclassified and sensitive national security information. The amendment will help ensure that universities are better protected against IP theft by malign foreign actors.* Seeking responsible policy in the Middle East: Senator Casey continues to support efforts toward a sustainable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He continues to speak out against the Administration's efforts to undermine peace and stability in the Middle East and supports Congressional checks on the President's incendiary actions toward Iran. To that end, Senator Casey co-sponsored provisions to prohibit the United States from expending funds which could lead to war with Iran without express approval from Congress, as required by the Constitution. Senator Casey will continue to fight to assert constitutionally-vested congressional authority over the decision to go to war and will push against reckless and thoughtless decisions that put Americans in harm's way.Senator Casey also jointly introduced a resolution with Sen. Lankford to affirm the work of Operation Good Neighbor, a partnership of the Israeli government, US NGO's, including faith-based organizations, and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to provide humanitarian relief to Syrians.

Between the ages of 8 and 16, they can spend less than 25 euros per month, an increase of up to 50 euros between the ages of 16 and 18.To make these new measures effective, the government will force players to register for video games using real information, no nicknames or false birth dates, suggesting control over the most popular video games it will also be re-escalatetod to make these limits not easily exceeded.Although most video games produced worldwide do not reach China, the consumption of own and adapted video games, such as Fortnite, has grown exponentially in recent years, to the point of becoming the second largest market in the world after the US.

Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26.

The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) edged above the S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%), and Russell 2000 (+0.3%).The market heard from both President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, on Friday. Mr. Xi called for mutual respect and equality in talks, but reiterated Beijing is willing to fight back if necessary. Mr. Trump said talks are moving along nicely and closing in on a deal, but the president suggested a deal should not be equal and should favor the U.S. instead.The takeaway was that the market still doesn't know for certain if a Phase One trade agreement will be signed this year, but talks are ongoing and appear to not be escalating. Separately, an upwardly revised reading in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November was supportive for equities today.Leading the market in gains were the S&P 500 financials (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.7%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors. The real estate (-0.5%) and energy (-0.4%) sectors were today's laggards.Nordstrom (JWN 37.95, +3.63, +10.6%) and Gap (GPS 16.94, +0.72, +4.4%) were among the biggest earnings-driven gainers in the consumer discretionary space, while an earnings-driven decline in Intuit (INTU 259.81, -11.34, -4.2%) put some pressure on the information technology sector (-0.1%).Elsewhere, the futuristic design of Tesla's (TSLA 333.04, -21.79, -6.1%) Cybertruck pickup was met with some confusion and mixed reviews. Ultimately, it appeared to be a sell-the-news case after the stock climbed about 40% in the past month.U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a flat note. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.26. WTI crude declined 1.2%, or $0.70, to $57.88/bbl.Friday's economic data was limited to the revised reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for November:The final November reading for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index checked in at 96.8 (Briefing.com consensus 94.9), which exceeded the preliminary estimate of 95.7 and the final October reading of 95.5. The November reading is in close proximity to the average level (97.0) since the start of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is the acknowledgment that consumers aren't anticipating sizable increases in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, which suggests consumer spending activity should remain supportive for the U.S. economy.Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.4% YTDS&P 500 +24.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.5% YTDRussell 2000 +17.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1717/1152. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1778/1303.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

NSF, JD Fresh Held Raised Without Antibiotics, Food Safety Assurance Forum in ChinaTargeted News ServiceNovember 22, 2019 Friday 1:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 500 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ANN ARBOR, Michigan BodyNSF International issued the following news release:On October 30, NSF and JD Fresh signed a memorandum of understanding during the China Fisheries and Seafood Expo in Qingdao. Both parties committed to promote Raised Without Antibiotics certification in China, to implement the "One Certification, Recognized Everywhere" initiative proposed by the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People's Republic of China and to promote the application of China-HACCP in the domestic supplier management system. JD Fresh, China's leading fresh food e-commerce platform, is committed to giving priority to companies that have obtained NSF certifications.In recent years, with the rapid development of China's economy, consumers' demand for animal products has changed dramatically. More and more people want food to be safer, healthier, nutritious and delicious. Food safety is the red line of every food business operation, and is gaining more and more weight in consumer purchasing decisions.A hot topic in food safety is products with no antibiotic residue. The reduction of antibiotic abuse has been highly valued by the Chinese government. Consumers prefer animal products raised without antibiotics, but at the same time, most consumers are not familiar with third-party certification for animal products. There is a huge demand in the market for a certification mark that can clearly indicate to consumers which products are raised without antibiotics.NSF is one of the few third-party organizations that can conduct raised without antibiotics certification, and is committed to introducing this certification into China.NSF's Raised Without Antibiotics certification provides consumers with the assurance that the animal products they buy have been produced without exposure to antibiotics used in human disease therapy. This certification provides buyers and consumers with transparency and consistency of the on-package claim and covers all animal products such as meat, poultry, seafood, fish, dairy and eggs.Chunlang Zhai, Senior Business Manager of JD Fresh, said in a speech at the seminar, "In the process of e-commerce development, third-party certification is of great significance to the business. Merchants who sells products on the JD platform must upgrade their brand premiums and combine the advantages of fresh products and e-commerce to enter the fast lane of development. Getting third-party certification is a very smart way to increase brand value. I hope that everyone on the JD platform can work together to build and promote a mature, advanced system."Other main participants at the seminar included Alan Zhao, JD Fresh PoP Managing Director; Wei Zhao, NSF International Director of Food Division and Audit Delivery of Greater China; Danny Zhang, NSF International Supply Chain Unit Manager; Ru Jia, NSF International Project Manager for Consumer Values Verified (CVV) and Sarah Wu, China Representative, SQF.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6939920 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 1, 2019End of Document

The investigation would be under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.Section 301 allows the president to impose trade restrictions if an investigation by the administration finds that a country is engaged in a practice that is "unjustifiable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce.""What it would do is it would create a situation that for another year would give the president leverage over the EU," a former administration official told the news site.This article originally ran on thecentersquare.com.Load-Date: November 26, 2019End of Document

Treasury futures held their ground during the early portion of the night, rallying to highs shortly after attention turned to the action in Europe. Treasury futures hit pre-market highs shortly before 4:00 ET, and they remain just below those levels at this time. The overnight session saw more trade-related headlines, but they didn't introduce any new information. Xinhua reported that Chinese trade negotiators held a phone call with their U.S. counterparts, agreeing to keep working toward a partial trade deal. Today's session will feature a fair share of economic data while the U.S. Treasury will auction $41 bln in 5-yr notes.

Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Mallinckrodt plc (MNK) announced findings from a large retrospective study of Acthar Gel (repository corticotropin injection) in the treatment of the respiratory disease symptomatic sarcoidosis that assessed patient characteristics, treatment patterns, concomitant medication use and physicians' assessments of treatment response. The study examined medical records from 302 patients with advanced symptomatic sarcoidosis, the majority of whom had comorbidities and had previously been treated with corticosteroids.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks.

The acquisition is structured with an upfront payment of approx. $55 mln, which will be funded primarily through MTS' existing revolving credit facility, with expected earnout payments of up to an additional $25 mln based on financial performance through June 2021. Given the strong backlog position of MTS at the end of fiscal 2019, the solid backlog position of R&D, and the expected incremental Adjusted EBITDA generation, MTS expects rapid strengthening of its balance sheet following the closing of this acquisition, with a forecasted year-over-year net reduction in leverage by the end of fiscal 2020.16:14MTSC MTS Systems misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS below two analyst estimate, revs above two analyst estimate (60.56 +2.39)Reports Q4 (Sep) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the two analyst estimate of $0.39; revenues rose 13.2% year/year to $224.08 mln vs the $218.07 mln two analyst estimate."As we enter our new fiscal year, we are excited about the resilience of our markets, our record year-end backlog, which topped $420 million, and the customer reception to our new product offerings.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approx. $11 bln and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.16:28BDX Becton Dickinson increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.79/share from $0.77/share (253.86 +3.97)16:25PANW Palo Alto Networks beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line with billings above guidance; guides Q2 revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 revs guidance; increases billings slightly, guides down EPS, impacted by announced acquisition of Aporeto for $150 mln (250.28 +3.41)Reports Q1 (Oct) earnings of $1.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.03; revenues rose 17.7% year/year to $772 mln vs the $769.34 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Billings increase 18% $897.4 mln vs. $870-890 mln guidanceCo issues guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.11-1.13, including Aporeto acquisition cost, may not be comparable to $1.30 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 revs of $838-848 mln vs. $844.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; billings $985-1.0 bln.Co issues guidance for FY20, lowers EPS to $4.90-5.00 from $5.00-5.10, including Aporeto, may not be comparable to $5.07 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; reaffirms FY20 revs of $3.44-3.48 bln vs. $3.47 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; raises billings to $4.105-4.165 bln from $4.095-4.155 blnCo is acquiring Aporeto Inc., a machine identity-based microsegmentation company for $150 million in cash Aporeto identifies workloads and applies microsegmentation across all infrastructures, helping customers secure their applications at scale.

Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off glucocorticoid treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the currently used glucocorticoid-containing standard of care (glucocorticoid SOC). The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the glucocorticoid SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to glucocorticoid standard of care (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Importantly, subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the glucocorticoid SOC control group.The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avacopan group than in the glucocorticoid SOC control group (42% vs. 45%, respectively). Most reported SAEs were related to underlying ANCA vasculitis disease and commensurate with rates in previously published ANCA vasculitis trials. There were fewer subjects with serious infections in the avacopan group than the glucocorticoid SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.16:08HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise beats by $0.03, misses on revs; guides Q1 EPS in-line; reaffirms FY20 guidance (17.45 +0.33)Reports Q4 (Oct) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.46; revenues fell 9.2% year/year to $7.21 bln vs the $7.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.GAAP gross margins of 33.2%, up 250 basis points from the prior-year period and Non-GAAP of 33.3%, up 260 basis points from the prior-year period.

ADVANCE evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjunctive pimavanserin treatment in patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia who have achieved adequate control of positive symptoms with their existing antipsychotic treatment. No drug is approved by the FDA for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.Pimavanserin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement on the study's primary endpoint, the change from baseline to week 26 on the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 (NSA-16) total score, compared to placebo (-10.4 vs. -8.5; p=0.043; effect size = 0.21). A greater improvement in the NSA-16 total score compared to placebo was observed in the 53.8% of patients (n=107) who received the highest pimavanserin dose of 34 mg (-11.6 vs. -8.5; unadjusted p=0.0065, effect size = 0.34). In this study, pimavanserin did not separate from placebo on the key secondary endpoint, the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale.ACADIA plans to commence a second pivotal study with the 34 mg dose of pimavanserin in the first half of 2020. Additional results from the ADVANCE study will be presented at future scientific meetings.16:03GBT Global Blood Therapeutics confirms FDA accelerated approval for Oxbryta tablets for the treatment of sickle cell disease; expected to be available through GBT's specialty pharmacy partner network within two weeks (59.95 +3.81)As a condition of accelerated approval, GBT will continue to study Oxbryta in the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, a post-approval confirmatory study using transcranial doppler (TCD) flow velocity to demonstrate a decrease in stroke risk in children 2 to 15 years of age.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

Trade has been at the forefront of headlines, but today could simply be a natural breather for a market hitting record highs.One last look inside the S&P 500 shows the real estate (+0.5%) and consumer staples (+0.5%) sectors continuing to outpace the broader market, while the energy sector (-1.4%) remains today's laggard amid a decline in oil prices.WTI crude futures settled down $0.71 (-1.2%) to $57.04/bbl amid lingering trade concerns that followed reported pessimism from China.15:00 ETDow +27.51 at 28032.31, Nasdaq +15.47 at 8556.3, S&P +2.41 at 3122.87[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices continue to hold incremental gains, but the small-cap Russell 2000 underperforms with a 0.3% decline.NVIDIA (NVDA 212.84, +8.72, +4.3%) is today's best-performing stock in the S&P 500 today on no specific news driver. Abiomed (ABMD 184.08, -39.15, -17.5%), on the other hand, is the worst performer in the benchmark index on concerns about the safety of its Impella device.Looking ahead, notable companies that will release earnings reports tomorrow morning include Home Depot (HD 238.53, +1.24, +0.5%), TJX Companies (TJX 59.64, -0.16, -0.3%), and Kohl's (KSS 58.52, -0.56, -1.0%).14:25 ETDow +32.79 at 28037.59, Nasdaq +16.36 at 8557.19, S&P +3.15 at 3123.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently trading near its best levels of the session with a gain of 0.1%.Gold futures settled up $3.60 (+0.3%) to $1471.90/oz, having received support on reported pessimism from China regarding a trade deal. Still, the yellow metal is still down 6% from its recent high on Sept. 4, while the S&P 500 is up more than 5% since that date.The U.S. Dollar Index, meanwhile, is trading 0.2% lower at 97.77.13:55 ETDow +34.78 at 28039.58, Nasdaq +7.87 at 8548.7, S&P +2.51 at 3122.97[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue holding slim gains after overcoming a shaky start to the trading day. The S&P 500 (+0.1%) holds a two-point gain, which puts the benchmark index on track for another record close. Similarly, the Dow (+0.1%) and Nasdaq (+0.1%) are also on course to establish fresh record closing highs today.Countercyclical groups like consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) have outperformed since the start of the session while cyclical sectors like technology (+0.3%), communication services (+0.3%) turned positive in the early afternoon. On the downside, the energy sector (-1.6%) trades well behind the remaining sectors as crude oil falls 1.8% to $56.70/bbl.Treasuries remain not far below their best levels of the day with the 10-yr yield down three basis points at 1.81%.13:30 ETDow +14.42 at 28019.22, Nasdaq -3.36 at 8537.47, S&P -0.08 at 3120.38[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices continue to trade mixed in a quiet start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Walt Disney (DIS 148.39, +3.72), UnitedHealth Group (UNH 274.48, +5.08), & Walmart (WMT 120.56, +1.69) are outperforming. Disney is leading the Dow higher as shares see continued strength on the heels of the company's successful launch of Disney+, while UnitedHealth is extending higher following last week's announcement from President Trump calling for transparency in hospital pricing. Elsewhere, Walmart is advancing after being mentioned positively in a weekend Barron's column.Conversely, Chevron (CVX 118.53, -2.11) is the worst-performing Dow component as the energy sector lags all other industries, due in part to a 2% decline in crude oil futures.Despite today's sideways trade, the DJIA is up 3.6% month-to-date.12:55 ETDow +15.44 at 28020.24, Nasdaq -4.93 at 8535.9, S&P -0.44 at 3120.02[BRIEFING.COM] The week has begun with the major indices struggling to find direction, although the S&P 500 (unch) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) have eked out intraday highs. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.Some hesitation may be attributed to a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, Eunice Yoon, saying a government source told her that the trade mood in Beijing has turned pessimistic due to President Trump not backing any tariff rollbacks. The tweet has contended with Chinese state media indicating that Phase One talks were constructive over the weekend.From an equity-index level, the strong resistance to any sort of pullback remains indicative of an expectation for some sort of an agreement. Investors remain inclined toward stocks, but money is flowing into the more defensive-oriented sectors like the S&P 500 consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.The energy sector (-1.4%) is today's outright laggard amid a decline in oil prices ($56.78/bbl, -$0.94, -1.6%). The industrials sector (-0.5%) is under broad-based selling pressure, too.Separately, Apple (AAPL 266.47, +0.70, +0.3%) continues to grind out new all-time highs.In corporate news, Netflix (NFLX 304.18, +9.15, +3.1%) shares are seeing increased demand on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have taken a large stake in the company. HP Inc. (HPQ 19.92, -0.26, -1.3%) rejected the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 38.94, unch), although it remains open to a deal.U.S. Treasuries are benefiting from a conservative mindset today. The uptick in demand has the benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.75.Today's lone economic report was the NAHB Housing Market Index for November, which declined to 70 from 71 in October.12:25 ETDow +9.16 at 28013.96, Nasdaq -2.59 at 8538.24, S&P +0.55 at 3121.01[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade sideways at its flat line.Netflix (NFLX 303.97, +8.94, +3.0%) continues to outperform the FAANG stocks on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have built a large stake in the company. Amazon (AMZN 1744.67, +5.18, +0.3%), Facebook (FB 195.19, +0.1%), Apple (AAPL 265.88, +0.12, +0.1%) trade slightly higher. Alphabet (GOOG 1323.30, -11.57, -0.9%) trades lower.Overseas, the major indices in European closed mixed. Germany's DAX declined 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.1%, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 finished unchanged.11:55 ETDow +14.14 at 28018.94, Nasdaq -2.35 at 8538.48, S&P +0.59 at 3121.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade little changed. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq trade near their flat lines, while the Dow clings onto a 0.1% gain.Money has continued to flow into the more defensive-minded sectors of the S&P 500 and the U.S. Treasury market today. The consumer staples (+0.9%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.7%) sectors are today's best-performing sectors and have added to last week's gains.The uptick in demand for Treasuries has pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.73.11:25 ETDow +9.14 at 28013.94, Nasdaq -11.73 at 8529.1, S&P -0.43 at 3120.03[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 trades unchanged, while the Dow trades up 0.1%. Earlier, the Dow set a new intraday high at 28030.22.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.2%) continues to grind higher despite any lingering trade uncertainty. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 39.70, +1.15, +3.0%) are up 3% after the stock's price target was raised to $47 from $40 at Cowen.Separately, shares of Coty (COTY 12.05, +0.14, +1.2%) are up 1% after the company took a 51% ownership stake in Kylie Jenner's beauty business for $600 million.10:55 ETDow +0.93 at 28005.73, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8528.35, S&P -2.56 at 3117.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.1%. It was recently announced that Fed Chair Powell met with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump, per the president's request, to discuss the economy, growth, employment, and inflation.According to the Federal Reserve, Mr. Powell's comments were consistent with his remarks at his congressional hearings last week. He did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economy. President Trump confirmed the meeting in a tweet.Separately, HP Inc.

The S&P 500 (+0.8%) closed above the 3100 level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%) closed above 28,000 -- both for the first time.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.7%) also closed at a record high, while the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) continued to trail its large-cap peers.The S&P 500 health care sector did the heavy lifting on Friday, climbing 2.2%, even as the Trump administration announced an initiative to increase price transparency from hospitals and insurers. Investors were evidently unconcerned about the proposal leading to an adverse effect on earnings.No other S&P 500 sector increased 1.0%, but the continued outperformance of Apple (AAPL 265.76, +3.12, +1.2%), Microsoft (MSFT 149.97, +1.91, +1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1334.87, +23.41, +1.8%) should not be understated.

Semiconductor stocks benefited from the trade news and the solid results and guidance from Applied Materials (AMAT 62.06, +5.10, +9.0%).

WTI crude rose 0.9%, or $0.99, to $57.75/bbl.Reviewing Friday's batch of economic data:October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) following an unrevised 0.3% decline in September. Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) after declining an unrevised 0.1% decline in September.The key takeaway from the report, other than it shows continued growth in discretionary spending, is that it will be a positive input for Q4 GDP. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline, building materials, and food services and drinking places sales, and which factor into the goods component of the PCE calculation, were up 0.3%.Import prices for October were down 0.5%. Excluding fuel, they were down 0.2%. Export prices were down 0.1%. Excluding agricultural products, they were down 0.3%.The key takeaway from the report is that it points to an indolent inflation backdrop.Industrial production slumped 0.8% in October (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.3% decline (from -0.4%) in September. The capacity utilization rate fell to 76.7% (Briefing.com consensus 77.1%) from 77.5% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that, while the GM strike had a big impact on industrial production, things were still weak excluding that impact. To wit, the Federal Reserve reports industrial production declined 0.5% excluding motor vehicles and parts.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) after a downwardly revised 0.1% decline (from 0.0%) in August. Total business sales were down 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.1% increase (from 0.2%) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+3.7%) and sales growth (+0.5%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.Looking ahead, investors will receive Net Long-Term TIC Flows for September on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.7% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1787/1070. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1860/1223.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 18, 2019End of Document

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

Trade has been at the forefront of headlines, but today could simply be a natural breather for a market hitting record highs.One last look inside the S&P 500 shows the real estate (+0.5%) and consumer staples (+0.5%) sectors continuing to outpace the broader market, while the energy sector (-1.4%) remains today's laggard amid a decline in oil prices.WTI crude futures settled down $0.71 (-1.2%) to $57.04/bbl amid lingering trade concerns that followed reported pessimism from China.15:00 ETDow +27.51 at 28032.31, Nasdaq +15.47 at 8556.3, S&P +2.41 at 3122.87[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices continue to hold incremental gains, but the small-cap Russell 2000 underperforms with a 0.3% decline.NVIDIA (NVDA 212.84, +8.72, +4.3%) is today's best-performing stock in the S&P 500 today on no specific news driver. Abiomed (ABMD 184.08, -39.15, -17.5%), on the other hand, is the worst performer in the benchmark index on concerns about the safety of its Impella device.Looking ahead, notable companies that will release earnings reports tomorrow morning include Home Depot (HD 238.53, +1.24, +0.5%), TJX Companies (TJX 59.64, -0.16, -0.3%), and Kohl's (KSS 58.52, -0.56, -1.0%).14:25 ETDow +32.79 at 28037.59, Nasdaq +16.36 at 8557.19, S&P +3.15 at 3123.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently trading near its best levels of the session with a gain of 0.1%.Gold futures settled up $3.60 (+0.3%) to $1471.90/oz, having received support on reported pessimism from China regarding a trade deal. Still, the yellow metal is still down 6% from its recent high on Sept. 4, while the S&P 500 is up more than 5% since that date.The U.S. Dollar Index, meanwhile, is trading 0.2% lower at 97.77.13:55 ETDow +34.78 at 28039.58, Nasdaq +7.87 at 8548.7, S&P +2.51 at 3122.97[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue holding slim gains after overcoming a shaky start to the trading day. The S&P 500 (+0.1%) holds a two-point gain, which puts the benchmark index on track for another record close. Similarly, the Dow (+0.1%) and Nasdaq (+0.1%) are also on course to establish fresh record closing highs today.Countercyclical groups like consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) have outperformed since the start of the session while cyclical sectors like technology (+0.3%), communication services (+0.3%) turned positive in the early afternoon. On the downside, the energy sector (-1.6%) trades well behind the remaining sectors as crude oil falls 1.8% to $56.70/bbl.Treasuries remain not far below their best levels of the day with the 10-yr yield down three basis points at 1.81%.13:30 ETDow +14.42 at 28019.22, Nasdaq -3.36 at 8537.47, S&P -0.08 at 3120.38[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices continue to trade mixed in a quiet start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Walt Disney (DIS 148.39, +3.72), UnitedHealth Group (UNH 274.48, +5.08), & Walmart (WMT 120.56, +1.69) are outperforming. Disney is leading the Dow higher as shares see continued strength on the heels of the company's successful launch of Disney+, while UnitedHealth is extending higher following last week's announcement from President Trump calling for transparency in hospital pricing. Elsewhere, Walmart is advancing after being mentioned positively in a weekend Barron's column.Conversely, Chevron (CVX 118.53, -2.11) is the worst-performing Dow component as the energy sector lags all other industries, due in part to a 2% decline in crude oil futures.Despite today's sideways trade, the DJIA is up 3.6% month-to-date.12:55 ETDow +15.44 at 28020.24, Nasdaq -4.93 at 8535.9, S&P -0.44 at 3120.02[BRIEFING.COM] The week has begun with the major indices struggling to find direction, although the S&P 500 (unch) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) have eked out intraday highs. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.Some hesitation may be attributed to a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, Eunice Yoon, saying a government source told her that the trade mood in Beijing has turned pessimistic due to President Trump not backing any tariff rollbacks. The tweet has contended with Chinese state media indicating that Phase One talks were constructive over the weekend.From an equity-index level, the strong resistance to any sort of pullback remains indicative of an expectation for some sort of an agreement. Investors remain inclined toward stocks, but money is flowing into the more defensive-oriented sectors like the S&P 500 consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.The energy sector (-1.4%) is today's outright laggard amid a decline in oil prices ($56.78/bbl, -$0.94, -1.6%). The industrials sector (-0.5%) is under broad-based selling pressure, too.Separately, Apple (AAPL 266.47, +0.70, +0.3%) continues to grind out new all-time highs.In corporate news, Netflix (NFLX 304.18, +9.15, +3.1%) shares are seeing increased demand on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have taken a large stake in the company. HP Inc. (HPQ 19.92, -0.26, -1.3%) rejected the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 38.94, unch), although it remains open to a deal.U.S. Treasuries are benefiting from a conservative mindset today. The uptick in demand has the benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.75.Today's lone economic report was the NAHB Housing Market Index for November, which declined to 70 from 71 in October.12:25 ETDow +9.16 at 28013.96, Nasdaq -2.59 at 8538.24, S&P +0.55 at 3121.01[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade sideways at its flat line.Netflix (NFLX 303.97, +8.94, +3.0%) continues to outperform the FAANG stocks on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have built a large stake in the company. Amazon (AMZN 1744.67, +5.18, +0.3%), Facebook (FB 195.19, +0.1%), Apple (AAPL 265.88, +0.12, +0.1%) trade slightly higher. Alphabet (GOOG 1323.30, -11.57, -0.9%) trades lower.Overseas, the major indices in European closed mixed. Germany's DAX declined 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.1%, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 finished unchanged.11:55 ETDow +14.14 at 28018.94, Nasdaq -2.35 at 8538.48, S&P +0.59 at 3121.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade little changed. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq trade near their flat lines, while the Dow clings onto a 0.1% gain.Money has continued to flow into the more defensive-minded sectors of the S&P 500 and the U.S. Treasury market today. The consumer staples (+0.9%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.7%) sectors are today's best-performing sectors and have added to last week's gains.The uptick in demand for Treasuries has pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.73.11:25 ETDow +9.14 at 28013.94, Nasdaq -11.73 at 8529.1, S&P -0.43 at 3120.03[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 trades unchanged, while the Dow trades up 0.1%. Earlier, the Dow set a new intraday high at 28030.22.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.2%) continues to grind higher despite any lingering trade uncertainty. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 39.70, +1.15, +3.0%) are up 3% after the stock's price target was raised to $47 from $40 at Cowen.Separately, shares of Coty (COTY 12.05, +0.14, +1.2%) are up 1% after the company took a 51% ownership stake in Kylie Jenner's beauty business for $600 million.10:55 ETDow +0.93 at 28005.73, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8528.35, S&P -2.56 at 3117.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.1%. It was recently announced that Fed Chair Powell met with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump, per the president's request, to discuss the economy, growth, employment, and inflation.According to the Federal Reserve, Mr. Powell's comments were consistent with his remarks at his congressional hearings last week.

The S&P 500 (+0.8%) closed above the 3100 level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%) closed above 28,000 -- both for the first time.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.7%) also closed at a record high, while the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) continued to trail its large-cap peers.The S&P 500 health care sector did the heavy lifting on Friday, climbing 2.2%, even as the Trump administration announced an initiative to increase price transparency from hospitals and insurers. Investors were evidently unconcerned about the proposal leading to an adverse effect on earnings.No other S&P 500 sector increased 1.0%, but the continued outperformance of Apple (AAPL 265.76, +3.12, +1.2%), Microsoft (MSFT 149.97, +1.91, +1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1334.87, +23.41, +1.8%) should not be understated.

Semiconductor stocks benefited from the trade news and the solid results and guidance from Applied Materials (AMAT 62.06, +5.10, +9.0%).

The 2-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.99. WTI crude rose 0.9%, or $0.99, to $57.75/bbl.Reviewing Friday's batch of economic data:October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) following an unrevised 0.3% decline in September. Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) after declining an unrevised 0.1% decline in September.The key takeaway from the report, other than it shows continued growth in discretionary spending, is that it will be a positive input for Q4 GDP. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline, building materials, and food services and drinking places sales, and which factor into the goods component of the PCE calculation, were up 0.3%.Import prices for October were down 0.5%. Excluding fuel, they were down 0.2%. Export prices were down 0.1%. Excluding agricultural products, they were down 0.3%.The key takeaway from the report is that it points to an indolent inflation backdrop.Industrial production slumped 0.8% in October (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.3% decline (from -0.4%) in September. The capacity utilization rate fell to 76.7% (Briefing.com consensus 77.1%) from 77.5% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that, while the GM strike had a big impact on industrial production, things were still weak excluding that impact. To wit, the Federal Reserve reports industrial production declined 0.5% excluding motor vehicles and parts.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) after a downwardly revised 0.1% decline (from 0.0%) in August. Total business sales were down 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.1% increase (from 0.2%) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+3.7%) and sales growth (+0.5%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.Looking ahead, investors will receive Net Long-Term TIC Flows for September on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.7% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1787/1070. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1860/1223.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 18, 2019End of Document

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

Trade has been at the forefront of headlines, but today could simply be a natural breather for a market hitting record highs.One last look inside the S&P 500 shows the real estate (+0.5%) and consumer staples (+0.5%) sectors continuing to outpace the broader market, while the energy sector (-1.4%) remains today's laggard amid a decline in oil prices.WTI crude futures settled down $0.71 (-1.2%) to $57.04/bbl amid lingering trade concerns that followed reported pessimism from China.15:00 ETDow +27.51 at 28032.31, Nasdaq +15.47 at 8556.3, S&P +2.41 at 3122.87[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices continue to hold incremental gains, but the small-cap Russell 2000 underperforms with a 0.3% decline.NVIDIA (NVDA 212.84, +8.72, +4.3%) is today's best-performing stock in the S&P 500 today on no specific news driver. Abiomed (ABMD 184.08, -39.15, -17.5%), on the other hand, is the worst performer in the benchmark index on concerns about the safety of its Impella device.Looking ahead, notable companies that will release earnings reports tomorrow morning include Home Depot (HD 238.53, +1.24, +0.5%), TJX Companies (TJX 59.64, -0.16, -0.3%), and Kohl's (KSS 58.52, -0.56, -1.0%).14:25 ETDow +32.79 at 28037.59, Nasdaq +16.36 at 8557.19, S&P +3.15 at 3123.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently trading near its best levels of the session with a gain of 0.1%.Gold futures settled up $3.60 (+0.3%) to $1471.90/oz, having received support on reported pessimism from China regarding a trade deal. Still, the yellow metal is still down 6% from its recent high on Sept. 4, while the S&P 500 is up more than 5% since that date.The U.S. Dollar Index, meanwhile, is trading 0.2% lower at 97.77.13:55 ETDow +34.78 at 28039.58, Nasdaq +7.87 at 8548.7, S&P +2.51 at 3122.97[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue holding slim gains after overcoming a shaky start to the trading day. The S&P 500 (+0.1%) holds a two-point gain, which puts the benchmark index on track for another record close. Similarly, the Dow (+0.1%) and Nasdaq (+0.1%) are also on course to establish fresh record closing highs today.Countercyclical groups like consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) have outperformed since the start of the session while cyclical sectors like technology (+0.3%), communication services (+0.3%) turned positive in the early afternoon. On the downside, the energy sector (-1.6%) trades well behind the remaining sectors as crude oil falls 1.8% to $56.70/bbl.Treasuries remain not far below their best levels of the day with the 10-yr yield down three basis points at 1.81%.13:30 ETDow +14.42 at 28019.22, Nasdaq -3.36 at 8537.47, S&P -0.08 at 3120.38[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices continue to trade mixed in a quiet start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Walt Disney (DIS 148.39, +3.72), UnitedHealth Group (UNH 274.48, +5.08), & Walmart (WMT 120.56, +1.69) are outperforming. Disney is leading the Dow higher as shares see continued strength on the heels of the company's successful launch of Disney+, while UnitedHealth is extending higher following last week's announcement from President Trump calling for transparency in hospital pricing. Elsewhere, Walmart is advancing after being mentioned positively in a weekend Barron's column.Conversely, Chevron (CVX 118.53, -2.11) is the worst-performing Dow component as the energy sector lags all other industries, due in part to a 2% decline in crude oil futures.Despite today's sideways trade, the DJIA is up 3.6% month-to-date.12:55 ETDow +15.44 at 28020.24, Nasdaq -4.93 at 8535.9, S&P -0.44 at 3120.02[BRIEFING.COM] The week has begun with the major indices struggling to find direction, although the S&P 500 (unch) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) have eked out intraday highs. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.Some hesitation may be attributed to a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, Eunice Yoon, saying a government source told her that the trade mood in Beijing has turned pessimistic due to President Trump not backing any tariff rollbacks. The tweet has contended with Chinese state media indicating that Phase One talks were constructive over the weekend.From an equity-index level, the strong resistance to any sort of pullback remains indicative of an expectation for some sort of an agreement. Investors remain inclined toward stocks, but money is flowing into the more defensive-oriented sectors like the S&P 500 consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.The energy sector (-1.4%) is today's outright laggard amid a decline in oil prices ($56.78/bbl, -$0.94, -1.6%). The industrials sector (-0.5%) is under broad-based selling pressure, too.Separately, Apple (AAPL 266.47, +0.70, +0.3%) continues to grind out new all-time highs.In corporate news, Netflix (NFLX 304.18, +9.15, +3.1%) shares are seeing increased demand on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have taken a large stake in the company. HP Inc. (HPQ 19.92, -0.26, -1.3%) rejected the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 38.94, unch), although it remains open to a deal.U.S. Treasuries are benefiting from a conservative mindset today. The uptick in demand has the benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.75.Today's lone economic report was the NAHB Housing Market Index for November, which declined to 70 from 71 in October.12:25 ETDow +9.16 at 28013.96, Nasdaq -2.59 at 8538.24, S&P +0.55 at 3121.01[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade sideways at its flat line.Netflix (NFLX 303.97, +8.94, +3.0%) continues to outperform the FAANG stocks on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have built a large stake in the company. Amazon (AMZN 1744.67, +5.18, +0.3%), Facebook (FB 195.19, +0.1%), Apple (AAPL 265.88, +0.12, +0.1%) trade slightly higher. Alphabet (GOOG 1323.30, -11.57, -0.9%) trades lower.Overseas, the major indices in European closed mixed. Germany's DAX declined 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.1%, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 finished unchanged.11:55 ETDow +14.14 at 28018.94, Nasdaq -2.35 at 8538.48, S&P +0.59 at 3121.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade little changed. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq trade near their flat lines, while the Dow clings onto a 0.1% gain.Money has continued to flow into the more defensive-minded sectors of the S&P 500 and the U.S. Treasury market today. The consumer staples (+0.9%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.7%) sectors are today's best-performing sectors and have added to last week's gains.The uptick in demand for Treasuries has pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.73.11:25 ETDow +9.14 at 28013.94, Nasdaq -11.73 at 8529.1, S&P -0.43 at 3120.03[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 trades unchanged, while the Dow trades up 0.1%. Earlier, the Dow set a new intraday high at 28030.22.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.2%) continues to grind higher despite any lingering trade uncertainty. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 39.70, +1.15, +3.0%) are up 3% after the stock's price target was raised to $47 from $40 at Cowen.Separately, shares of Coty (COTY 12.05, +0.14, +1.2%) are up 1% after the company took a 51% ownership stake in Kylie Jenner's beauty business for $600 million.10:55 ETDow +0.93 at 28005.73, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8528.35, S&P -2.56 at 3117.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.1%. It was recently announced that Fed Chair Powell met with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump, per the president's request, to discuss the economy, growth, employment, and inflation.According to the Federal Reserve, Mr. Powell's comments were consistent with his remarks at his congressional hearings last week. He did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economy. President Trump confirmed the meeting in a tweet.Separately, HP Inc.

The S&P 500 (+0.8%) closed above the 3100 level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%) closed above 28,000 -- both for the first time.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.7%) also closed at a record high, while the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) continued to trail its large-cap peers.The S&P 500 health care sector did the heavy lifting on Friday, climbing 2.2%, even as the Trump administration announced an initiative to increase price transparency from hospitals and insurers. Investors were evidently unconcerned about the proposal leading to an adverse effect on earnings.No other S&P 500 sector increased 1.0%, but the continued outperformance of Apple (AAPL 265.76, +3.12, +1.2%), Microsoft (MSFT 149.97, +1.91, +1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1334.87, +23.41, +1.8%) should not be understated. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.86, +0.44, +1.0%) and Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.9%) also showed relative strength.Retail stocks extended yesterday's advance after October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Semiconductor stocks benefited from the trade news and the solid results and guidance from Applied Materials (AMAT 62.06, +5.10, +9.0%).

The 2-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.99. WTI crude rose 0.9%, or $0.99, to $57.75/bbl.Reviewing Friday's batch of economic data:October retail sales increased 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) following an unrevised 0.3% decline in September. Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) after declining an unrevised 0.1% decline in September.The key takeaway from the report, other than it shows continued growth in discretionary spending, is that it will be a positive input for Q4 GDP. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline, building materials, and food services and drinking places sales, and which factor into the goods component of the PCE calculation, were up 0.3%.Import prices for October were down 0.5%. Excluding fuel, they were down 0.2%. Export prices were down 0.1%. Excluding agricultural products, they were down 0.3%.The key takeaway from the report is that it points to an indolent inflation backdrop.Industrial production slumped 0.8% in October (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.3% decline (from -0.4%) in September. The capacity utilization rate fell to 76.7% (Briefing.com consensus 77.1%) from 77.5% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that, while the GM strike had a big impact on industrial production, things were still weak excluding that impact. To wit, the Federal Reserve reports industrial production declined 0.5% excluding motor vehicles and parts.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) after a downwardly revised 0.1% decline (from 0.0%) in August. Total business sales were down 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.1% increase (from 0.2%) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+3.7%) and sales growth (+0.5%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.Looking ahead, investors will receive Net Long-Term TIC Flows for September on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.7% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1787/1070. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1860/1223.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 18, 2019End of Document

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

Trade has been at the forefront of headlines, but today could simply be a natural breather for a market hitting record highs.One last look inside the S&P 500 shows the real estate (+0.5%) and consumer staples (+0.5%) sectors continuing to outpace the broader market, while the energy sector (-1.4%) remains today's laggard amid a decline in oil prices.WTI crude futures settled down $0.71 (-1.2%) to $57.04/bbl amid lingering trade concerns that followed reported pessimism from China.15:00 ETDow +27.51 at 28032.31, Nasdaq +15.47 at 8556.3, S&P +2.41 at 3122.87[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices continue to hold incremental gains, but the small-cap Russell 2000 underperforms with a 0.3% decline.NVIDIA (NVDA 212.84, +8.72, +4.3%) is today's best-performing stock in the S&P 500 today on no specific news driver. Abiomed (ABMD 184.08, -39.15, -17.5%), on the other hand, is the worst performer in the benchmark index on concerns about the safety of its Impella device.Looking ahead, notable companies that will release earnings reports tomorrow morning include Home Depot (HD 238.53, +1.24, +0.5%), TJX Companies (TJX 59.64, -0.16, -0.3%), and Kohl's (KSS 58.52, -0.56, -1.0%).14:25 ETDow +32.79 at 28037.59, Nasdaq +16.36 at 8557.19, S&P +3.15 at 3123.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently trading near its best levels of the session with a gain of 0.1%.Gold futures settled up $3.60 (+0.3%) to $1471.90/oz, having received support on reported pessimism from China regarding a trade deal. Still, the yellow metal is still down 6% from its recent high on Sept. 4, while the S&P 500 is up more than 5% since that date.The U.S. Dollar Index, meanwhile, is trading 0.2% lower at 97.77.13:55 ETDow +34.78 at 28039.58, Nasdaq +7.87 at 8548.7, S&P +2.51 at 3122.97[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue holding slim gains after overcoming a shaky start to the trading day. The S&P 500 (+0.1%) holds a two-point gain, which puts the benchmark index on track for another record close. Similarly, the Dow (+0.1%) and Nasdaq (+0.1%) are also on course to establish fresh record closing highs today.Countercyclical groups like consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) have outperformed since the start of the session while cyclical sectors like technology (+0.3%), communication services (+0.3%) turned positive in the early afternoon. On the downside, the energy sector (-1.6%) trades well behind the remaining sectors as crude oil falls 1.8% to $56.70/bbl.Treasuries remain not far below their best levels of the day with the 10-yr yield down three basis points at 1.81%.13:30 ETDow +14.42 at 28019.22, Nasdaq -3.36 at 8537.47, S&P -0.08 at 3120.38[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices continue to trade mixed in a quiet start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Walt Disney (DIS 148.39, +3.72), UnitedHealth Group (UNH 274.48, +5.08), & Walmart (WMT 120.56, +1.69) are outperforming. Disney is leading the Dow higher as shares see continued strength on the heels of the company's successful launch of Disney+, while UnitedHealth is extending higher following last week's announcement from President Trump calling for transparency in hospital pricing. Elsewhere, Walmart is advancing after being mentioned positively in a weekend Barron's column.Conversely, Chevron (CVX 118.53, -2.11) is the worst-performing Dow component as the energy sector lags all other industries, due in part to a 2% decline in crude oil futures.Despite today's sideways trade, the DJIA is up 3.6% month-to-date.12:55 ETDow +15.44 at 28020.24, Nasdaq -4.93 at 8535.9, S&P -0.44 at 3120.02[BRIEFING.COM] The week has begun with the major indices struggling to find direction, although the S&P 500 (unch) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) have eked out intraday highs. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.Some hesitation may be attributed to a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, Eunice Yoon, saying a government source told her that the trade mood in Beijing has turned pessimistic due to President Trump not backing any tariff rollbacks. The tweet has contended with Chinese state media indicating that Phase One talks were constructive over the weekend.From an equity-index level, the strong resistance to any sort of pullback remains indicative of an expectation for some sort of an agreement. Investors remain inclined toward stocks, but money is flowing into the more defensive-oriented sectors like the S&P 500 consumer staples (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.The energy sector (-1.4%) is today's outright laggard amid a decline in oil prices ($56.78/bbl, -$0.94, -1.6%). The industrials sector (-0.5%) is under broad-based selling pressure, too.Separately, Apple (AAPL 266.47, +0.70, +0.3%) continues to grind out new all-time highs.In corporate news, Netflix (NFLX 304.18, +9.15, +3.1%) shares are seeing increased demand on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have taken a large stake in the company. HP Inc. (HPQ 19.92, -0.26, -1.3%) rejected the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 38.94, unch), although it remains open to a deal.U.S. Treasuries are benefiting from a conservative mindset today. The uptick in demand has the benchmark 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.75.Today's lone economic report was the NAHB Housing Market Index for November, which declined to 70 from 71 in October.12:25 ETDow +9.16 at 28013.96, Nasdaq -2.59 at 8538.24, S&P +0.55 at 3121.01[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade sideways at its flat line.Netflix (NFLX 303.97, +8.94, +3.0%) continues to outperform the FAANG stocks on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman have built a large stake in the company. Amazon (AMZN 1744.67, +5.18, +0.3%), Facebook (FB 195.19, +0.1%), Apple (AAPL 265.88, +0.12, +0.1%) trade slightly higher. Alphabet (GOOG 1323.30, -11.57, -0.9%) trades lower.Overseas, the major indices in European closed mixed. Germany's DAX declined 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.1%, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 finished unchanged.11:55 ETDow +14.14 at 28018.94, Nasdaq -2.35 at 8538.48, S&P +0.59 at 3121.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade little changed. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq trade near their flat lines, while the Dow clings onto a 0.1% gain.Money has continued to flow into the more defensive-minded sectors of the S&P 500 and the U.S. Treasury market today. The consumer staples (+0.9%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.7%) sectors are today's best-performing sectors and have added to last week's gains.The uptick in demand for Treasuries has pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note down two basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 97.73.11:25 ETDow +9.14 at 28013.94, Nasdaq -11.73 at 8529.1, S&P -0.43 at 3120.03[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 trades unchanged, while the Dow trades up 0.1%.

Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) after declining an unrevised 0.1% decline in September.The key takeaway from the report, other than it shows continued growth in discretionary spending, is that it will be a positive input for Q4 GDP. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline, building materials, and food services and drinking places sales, and which factor into the goods component of the PCE calculation, were up 0.3%.Import prices for October were down 0.5%. Excluding fuel, they were down 0.2%. Export prices were down 0.1%. Excluding agricultural products, they were down 0.3%.The key takeaway from the report is that it points to an indolent inflation backdrop.Industrial production slumped 0.8% in October (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.3% decline (from -0.4%) in September. The capacity utilization rate fell to 76.7% (Briefing.com consensus 77.1%) from 77.5% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that, while the GM strike had a big impact on industrial production, things were still weak excluding that impact. To wit, the Federal Reserve reports industrial production declined 0.5% excluding motor vehicles and parts.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) after a downwardly revised 0.1% decline (from 0.0%) in August. Total business sales were down 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.1% increase (from 0.2%) in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+3.7%) and sales growth (+0.5%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.Looking ahead, investors will receive Net Long-Term TIC Flows for September on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +28.7% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1787/1070. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1860/1223.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: November 18, 2019End of Document

Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 12th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Chaos in Hong Kong, once again, you are looking at a live video shot from outside the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as violent protests continue this morning. Police saying that the activists are leading the city to the brink of a total breakdown.The strength of the U.S. economy on tap, President Trump speaking at the New York Economic Club today, as the public impeachment hearings will begin tomorrow. We're taking a look at the growing controversy over who could be called to testify.The streaming wars heat up, the long-awaited Disney+ is here, what its deep library and new originals mean for the competition. And markets this morning, are seeking out new highs.Take a look at the Futures this morning, showing a gain at the start of trading of Dow Futures up 18, S&P Futures up 1 point, NASDAQ Futures up 7- 1/2, on top of another record high yesterday for the Dow. The Dow had its ninth record close of the year, yesterday, at 27,691.Global markets this morning, also have a firmer tone, take a look at European indices, where the FT-100 is up 27, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 12, and the DAX Index in Germany is higher by 70 points.President Trump reportedly ready to delay tariffs on European autos, in exchange for investments in the United States. In Asia overnight, markets were higher despite the unrest in Hong Kong, and uncertainty over trade deal with China. Japan was strong, the Nikkei, hitting a 13-month high due to strong earnings from construction companies, as you see, the Nikkei, best performer.Another sign of economic weakness, however, in China, we have the auto sales report for the month, falling 5.8 percent in October. And more trouble for Juul to report, the company cutting costs by nearly $1 billion next year, and that will include reducing its workforce.More privacy concerns for Google this morning, reports that the technology giant is gathering personal health records of millions of people, the alarming details, doctors and nurses were not told, nor were patients.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, and joining me to break it all down, Moody's Capital Markets chief economist, John Lonski, Campusreform.org editor-in-chief, Cabot Phillips, and Laffer Tengler Investments chief investment officer, Nancy Tengler. Great to see everybody this morning.Yes, we're going to hear from President Trump later today, on the economy. We also have retail sales coming out later in the week, you mentioned that Wal-Mart's going to be reporting earnings as well, any cracks in the consumer that you see so far?NANCY TENGLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, LAFFER TENGLER INVESTMENTS: I, you know, I think the consumer's in pretty good shape. We got lower taxes, lower oil prices, low interest rates, right? And then --BARTIROMO: Higher wages.TENGLER: Higher wages --BARTIROMO: Yes.TENGLER: -- not as much as we'd all like, but higher. And so, I think Wal-Mart will be instructed because it's no longer just a low-income measure. It -- you know, with the e-commerce business growing in almost 40 percent a year, they own companies like Bonobos, higher end retailers (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: Yes.TENGLER: So, I think this is going to be a really important report.BARTIROMO: It's important because retail sales were down last month, right John?JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: Yes, they were, so it's really important that we have some, sort of, positive news on retail sales for October, that's consensus expectation, but they're not looking for much of an increase by retail sales.And so, that on a year-over-year basis, the U.S. government's measure of retail sales running at about 3.5 percent --BARTIROMO: Yes.LONSKI: -- is good, decent, but no reason for us to worry about an overheating economy, the return of faster price inflation. A bit worried, though, about that 10-year yield --BARTIROMO: Yes.LONSKI: -- 1.7 percent, start of the month, now it's over 1.9, 1.95. That could create problems for housing.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll see about that. We are covering the retail sales number and, obviously, rates, all week.Our top story this hour is the impeachment inquiry. President Trump is set to speak at the New York Economic Club later today, one day before the impeachment hearings go public, Democrats hoping to make a case that the President pressured Ukrainian into investigating Joe Biden and his son, over allegations of corruption.The President tweeted this morning, I will be releasing the transcript of the first, and therefore more important phone call with the Ukrainian president before week's end.Joining us right now is the Washington Times opinion editor and columnist, and FOX News contributor, Charles Hurt. Charlie, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: How do you think this plays out this week, with these public hearings?HURT: Well, I think it's going to be really interesting, because if Democrats are able to actually capture the attention of regular voters and regular citizens, in America, to follow this long winding rabbit trail, that they have -- that they have constructed, that they -- that they think adds up to impeachment, I'll be very impressed. I think what will actually happen is, we'll have -- we'll have the hearings.There -- you know, absolutely there's going to be a lot of attention paid to it, everybody's going to be covering this stuff, live.But, very quickly, people are going to start losing interest, because it's so convoluted in a case where you don't, you know, not only do you not have a quid, you don't have a quo, and nobody understands what any of it -- how any of it, you know, amounts to impeachment in the first place.I think -- I think it's going to be a big stage and it's going to be fun to watch how it turns out, but I really don't see American interests remaining terribly strong in it.CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Hey, Charles, Cabot Phillips here, do you think there's a chance that this becomes Russia 2.0 where, you know, the Democrats really came in hot, saying there's clear evidence of collusion here, it's going to happen. And in a way, I think President Trump almost benefitted from that in the long run, being able to point to how out of touch they were.Do you think that happens here where the Democrats overplay their hands, saying, we're going to have clear evidence, he's going to be impeached, and it doesn't end up happening and it ends up helping Trump in the long run.HURT: I think that's absolutely what's going to happen here. And a big reason why, is because they did go through the Russia gate. They've gone through all these other things. They went through the Steele dossier. They've thrown all of these things at him.And at some point, people -- even if you're not paying attention to every, you know, twist and turn the way -- the way many of us are. The fact that, you know -- that somewhere in your mind you know, that they have thrown everything at this guy, and the only common thread through all of it is, they want him removed from office.Well, trying to undo the 2016 election, in the middle of the next election, basically, that they want to, sort of, delete the -- not only the 2016 election, but the 2020 election, because they don't think that they can beat him with open borders and socialism and all this kind of stuff. That shines through pretty clearly.BARTIROMO: Yes.HURT: And it's not a very good sell to voters, that oh, you know, in the middle of a campaign to go to voters and say, we want to take your vote away.BARTIROMO: Yes.HURT: It's not a very -- that's usually not successful.BARTIROMO: Here we are when Americans are going to go to the polls, in less than a year, but, you know, they also -- the process is being -- is being criticized, you know.Lindsey Graham -- Senator Graham, as well as Congressman Kevin McCarthy, both joined me on Sunday, on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" and they basically said, look, even if we want to call witnesses down for these public hearings, we've got to check with Adam Schiff.Also, Adam Schiff made the rule change whereas, if you want to yield time, to your colleague, you can't do that. In the past, when you've got hearings, if Devin Nunes wants to yield his five minutes to John Ratcliffe, because John Ratcliffe is a former federal prosecutor and might be able to ask the questions better or get at the truth easier, Schiff said no.You can't yield your time to anybody for the first 45 minutes, so there's that. I mean, Adam Schiff is putting in all these extra rules.HURT: And, you know, if it -- you know, I've always believed that Americans -- they have a very, very keen sense of fairness. And when they see something unfair happening, you know, it has nothing to do with Donald Trump. You know, it's not unfair to Donald Trump per se. It's unfair to the American system of elections. It's unfair to the American voter.BARTIROMO: Yes.HURT: And that's the thing that's going on here. It's not that Donald, you know, Donald Trump -- the person is being denied something. It's that the vote that people cast --BARTIROMO: Right.HURT: -- whether you agree with it or not, you know, I couldn't count something like this.BARTIROMO: Well, the other thing is, that the Republicans want to question the whistleblower, so, you know, he or she is why we are here. The whistleblower had a problem, and unless the Republicans hire, you know -- are able to actually get to the crux of what the whistleblower knows of what he heard or what he -- what he didn't hear. This is what Lindsey Graham told me, Sunday. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): It's impossible to bring this case forward, in my view, fairly, without us knowing who the whistleblower is, and having a chance to cross-examine them about any biases that they may have. So, if they don't call the whistleblower in the House, this thing is dead on arrival in the Senate.BARTIROMO: For a long time, Adam Schiff said he wanted to speak to the whistleblower. Then, we found out that his staff actually did meet with the whistleblower. So, now he doesn't want to speak to the whistleblower in any of these hearings any longer. GRAHAM: Well, because what's going to happen, when you find out who the whistleblower is? I'm confident you're going to find out that somebody from the deep state. You're going to find out that they had interactions with Schiff, and these things going to stink to high heaven, and the only reason we don't know who the whistleblower is, that it hurts their cause. They're not trying to find the truth here.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Your reaction, Charles?HURT: You know, Lindsey Graham is exactly right about that. And, I think there are two reasons that they don't -- that Schiff suddenly doesn't want the whistleblower out there, one is, because of what he said, that now we know that they did speak beforehand or his office spoke to the whistleblower beforehand.But the other thing is this, that it does begin -- you start to see a pattern here where the whistleblower -- the real problem that the whistleblower has, wasn't that call in particular. It's that the whistleblower has a problem with the President's policies and his agenda, in a place like Ukraine.Well, you know who gets to set policy and agenda in Ukraine? The person that got elected, not some whistleblower that's disgruntled, but for some reason, had some position in the White House who probably shouldn't.LONSKI: Quite frankly, Charles, the economy, business activity, consumers and financial markets, could care less about this impeachment investigation. And I think that is going to continue to be the case. Any thoughts?HURT: And, you know, that's a real problem, I think, because you know, obviously, the whole active impeachment should be and is a very, very serious thing.BARTIROMO: Yes.HURT: In fact, that the people who -- that who are kind of the most serious in our economy, aren't even paying attention to it because they think it's such a farce, and they think it's such a joke, that's a real degradation of our political system because impeachment was not meant to be --BARTIROMO: A joke.HURT: -- a tool to beat up people that we disagreed with. It was meant to be a tool that was -- a tool of last resort, meant to remove somebody who is -- who is a real danger and a real criminal that, you know, that voters themselves would be in favor of removing, if we had an election.BARTIROMO: You're right.HURT: That's not what's going on here.BARTIROMO: That's very well said. Charles, great to have you this morning, thanks so much.HURT: Great to be with you. Thanks.BARTIROMO: Charles Hurt, joining us there. Joining the conversation this morning, the Chief of Staff to Vice President Mike Pence, is here, Marc Short. He'll weigh in Hong Kong and impeachment, the co-founder of HealthCare.com, CEO of PivotHealth, Jeff Smedsrud, on healthcare in America today, and the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney, will weigh in as well.Don't miss the rest of the hour here. First, we will slip in a short break. And then, Google has got a big secret, the technology giant reportedly collecting the personal health data of millions of Americans without notifying doctors or patients.Then, this, Disney just can't wait to be king, it's revving up the streaming wars with the launch of Disney+, how it's impacting the competition, next up. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It is a big day for Disney, launching its long- awaited streaming service Disney+. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at Disney and the other movers today. Hey, Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. That's right. So, trouble in the house of the mouse. Let me tell you, right now, Disney+ experiencing unable to connect errors. This from the Verge that says reports of errors spiking across Twitter this morning, as the East Coast wakes up and starts trying to sign on. So, I'm sure they'll have something to do about that. It could be a good sign for Disney as they launch their streaming service. We have from Eagle Alpha. I know you've been looking for the number of people who are signing up. They are an aggregator of alternative data. They say the Disney system getting traction this morning as they look at tweets, 5 million tweets.Meanwhile, a lot is riding on this launch, of course, we know that they have Marvel Disney, Lucasfilm, Pixar, these franchises are huge. They're offering it for 6.99. That's almost the lowest price out there. Only Apple is lower, and they're using all the power of their vast library and nostalgia to put this forward. Meanwhile, Barons is saying that Disney expects 90 million subscribers in five years. That's a forecast from the company itself. And they don't expect Disney+ to turn a profit in the next five years either. So, lots going on this morning. We've got unable to connect errors for Disney+ out there, but the stock moving up very handily. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri, thank you. Disney starts today. What do you think, are you going to buy it?TENGLER: Yes. Buy the service or buy the --BARTIROMO: Yes, the service.TENGLER: Yes, of course, I am.BARTIROMO: You own Disney stock, right?TENGLER: I do. I do indeed, yes. I'd like to -- Lance said earlier today from Lifewire -- Ulanoff -- when he said he had a box of VHSs, and that's exactly how it was in my house. I just got rid of them. So, it'd be fun to plug back in. I want to see Dumbo.BARTIROMO: Yes. And now, it's a very competitive situation. As I've been saying, the $15 billion, you know, price tag that Netflix is going to have to write that check every year is going to be -- is tough. We'll see if markets like that.TENGLER: Yes.LONSKI: Content is king. You know, this past week, we just upgraded the credit rating of Viacom because of the merger with CBS. They're going to have a lot of market power in this particular space.PHILLIPS: Average American has 3.8 streaming services for just for themselves per household. So, I think there is plenty of room to grow there. My big problem is always remembering my different passwords for streaming services.(CROSSTALK)TENGLER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Yes.TENGLER: I have zero, by the way.PHILLIPS: It's streamlining there, it make things easier.BARTIROMO: You mentioned rates earlier, John, that the 10-year was at 1.7 percent creeping up to 1.9 percent.LONSKI: Yes.BARTIROMO: You think markets will get upset if rates keep --LONSKI: I think if it heads up over two percent, yes, they are going to start to become worried that perhaps borrowing costs are becoming too burdensome, especially in the housing market, the mortgage market. We had a strong run of late by the -- by housing sector share prices. But recently that particular price index, stock price index, has been declining in response to worry over how high bond yields might climb.BARTIROMO: And mortgage rates, low mortgage rates have certainly helped the housing market last couple of months.LONSKI: They have. And of course -- but you know, oddly enough, we have a very wide difference and an unusually wide difference between the mortgage yield, 30-year mortgage yield, and its benchmark Treasury yield. And the suppliers of a mortgage credit say that that reflects a very strong demand for mortgage credit.BARTIROMO: Yes.LONSKI: But we'll wait and see how this plays out.BARTIROMO: I'm surprised we didn't talk more about the auto story, auto loans, this auto part of corner of the market. I was just touring The Journal yesterday, and when I went home and I was reading through it, I thought, Oh, you know what, this could be a worry sign. One guy that they -- that they talked about in the article yesterday, he bought a Jeep, it was $25,000, but unfortunately his loan was up to $48,000. He kept taking out loans to buy the car, and he ends up doubling the price of the car with all these loans. People need to understand that -- what they're doing with auto loans.LONSKI: Yes, she's a little bit foolhardy.BARTIROMO: Yes, it really does.LONSKI: Over the top. With auto loans, you look at the federal funds rate, that's moved lower, that should be helping auto sales. We hope it does fairly soon. But we do have a global slump of auto sales. We had evidence of that today with news from China, auto Sales being down. You've got to be concerned about that sector. You're not going to get a healthy recovery by manufacturing until auto sales grow again globally.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, we are focused on the violence in Hong Kong this morning. It escalated overnight. Police say that the city has been pushed to the brink of a, quote, total breakdown. Protests now erupting into a -- the work week as well, not just the weekends.Chief of Staff of Vice President Mike Pence is here, Marc Short, will weigh in on how the administration will respond to this. Then, big tech targets healthcare, Google reportedly collecting the personal health data of millions of Americans neither patients nor doctors have been notified. Everything you need to know when we come back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Google reportedly gathering personal health information from millions of Americans. The technology giant apparently began the so-called "Project Nightingale" in secret last year, as part of its partnership with the Ascension Health System. That's going to The Wall Street Journal. Joining us right now is the co-founder of healthcare.com and the CEO of Pivot Health, Jeff Smedsrud. And Jeff, it's is great to have you on the program this morning. Thanks for joining us.JEFF SMEDSRUD, CEO, PIVOT HEALTH: Well, it's great to be here. Thanks you.BARTIROMO: We know that it's enrollment period, and this time is always confusing for people. So, we were invested in our audience. We want to make sure we're giving them as much information as possible during enrollment season. So, we're going to get to that in a second.First, tell us your reaction to the story this morning, the top story in the Journal that Google is getting the medical records of many millions of Americans, already 150 people who work at Google have all the data of medical things like lab results. What's your reaction to this?SMEDSRUD: Well, I think there's a massive amount of good that can come from big data, but a massive amount of mischief, as well. And we have to understand that it's -- that data belongs to me. It's our data. And the important thing for policymakers and for companies like Google and for all of us is, how are we going to deal with this amount of data and the regulations that we have that protect data are very old, 1996, HIPAA. Most of the insurance regulations that govern health insurance and life insurance, 1998 was the last time they've been changed. So, we need relevant regulations, and a discussion about the positives and potential negatives.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, Google says it is gathering all this information so that it could come up with a design, a new software. Look, I know that technology has enabled us to live longer, and that's wonderful. We're getting ahead of disease. But shouldn't patients and doctors have been notified that they were collecting all this data on it?SMEDSRUD: Well, I think it's our data. It's personal data. And it needs to be used correctly, and it has to have our permission. And that is where there's a massive amount of mischief that comes into play with all of this.BARTIROMO: All right, let's talk about open enrollment. Americans are starting to sign up for 2020 health care plans through their employers and the federal government. Many times, it's hard to know which plan is best. Your company does that, healthcare. com. Tell us about the options and what people need to understand during open enrollment season?SMEDSRUD: Well, at healthcare.com, we helped millions of consumers shop, we show them different plans. We have more than 200 articles on our Web site that give some ideas about what to look for in plans. For open enrollment this year, several things to remember: One, the plan you have may not be the best plan. Prices change, networks change. Secondly, make sure you shop around. Third, understand if you're subsidy eligible or not subsidy eligible. The market is bifurcating between those that are subsidy eligible, below 400 percent of the poverty level, and those that are not. And there's different options for people based on their income.Also, remember, there's no mandate, so there's no requirement that you buy a particular type of health insurance. And so, you can tailor plans to meet your specific needs. And last, I'd say the job of government is to set the rules and regulations, the job of consumers is to do what's best for each of us using those rules and regulations. So, shop, compare, look at your options, you're in charge, but most importantly, buy some type of insurance. Don't be uninsured.TENGLER: So Jeff, what is an Alyssa Warren's Medicare for all plan do to your business model, if anything?SMEDSRUD: Well, I don't --BARTIROMO: Well, it's going to eliminate 180 million people's health insurance, right? Because she's doing away with the private health insurance.SMEDSRUD: That's the sound bite. But the reality is if you look at Medicare, what makes Medicare popular, introduce popular to a lot of people, the private sector makes Medicare popular. Medicare is popular because of Medicare Advantage, run by the private sector.TENGLER: Right.SMEDSRUD: It's popular because of Medicare Supplements run by the private sector. It's popular because of Part D run by the private sector. If you take all the private sector initiatives out of Medicare, it's a broken system. So, I don't think it's feasible. And I think if you had a Medicare For All, you'd have a Medicare Supplement for all.TENGLER: Right.SMEDSRUD: And there's nothing that really changes in that.TENGLER: Yes, and that happened in the U.K., right? I mean --(CROSSTALK)SMEDSRUD: Absolutely.TENGLER: -- private plans that -- yes.BARTIROMO: Nothing changes even after $52 trillion, the cost of Medicare For All.TENGLER: Exactly.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: The cost.(CROSSTALK)SMEDSRUD: Let the private sector spend some of that money way more effectively by creating new technology, by creating tools, by giving people more choice.BARTIROMO: Yes. Jeff, it's great to have you. Thanks so much.SMEDSRUD: Hey, thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks for the advice on open enrollments, as well. Jeff Smedsrud. Check out healthcare.com. Quick break, then violence in Hong Kong escalating overnight. Police say that the city has been pushed to the brink of a, quote, total breakdown. Chief of Staff to Vice President Mike Pence is here, Marc Short to weigh in. Then, how the administration is responding. Then, wicked weather slammed the United States and American Airlines flights skidding off the icy runway in Chicago. The chilling moment, plus the latest forecast for you, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, November 12th. Your top stories right now. 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast. There was chaos in Hong Kong overnight once again. These are live pictures as nighttime descends on the city. Police said that rioters have committed insane acts including throwing trash onto train tracks and power lines, paralyzing the transportation system. Bringing the city to the brink of a total breakdown.Tapping the brakes on tariffs, President Trump reportedly ready to delay tariffs on European autos. The White House reaction coming up. And market this morning are higher seeking out new highs. In fact, the Dow futures are up 13 points, the S&P futures are up half a point. The NASDAQ futures up seven but this is on top of another record setter yesterday where the Dow Industrials finished in uncharted territory.Global markets this morning look like this. European indices are higher across the board. FT-100 is up 30 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 14 and the DAX Index in Germany is higher by 68. In Asia overnight, markets will hire despite the unrest in Hong Kong and some uncertainty of a trade with China. The Nikkei hit a 13-month high due to strong earnings. As you can see the Nikkei average up almost one percent.However, there was another sign of economic weakness in China. Auto sales were down 5.8 percent in the month of October. The deep freeze is coming. The majority of the country feeling the chill already. Plus, a scary landing for one flight in Chicago sliding off the runway. We've got all those stories coming up.But first our top story this half an hour, Hong Kong in crisis mode. The city rocked by brutal protests for six straight months showing no signs of stopping. Police today fired tear gas and Hong Kong's financial district and on two university campuses. A police spokesman said that the city has been pushed to the brink of a total breakdown. Joining me right now is the Chief of Staff for Vice President Mike Pence, Marc Short is here. Mark, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for being here.MARC SHORT, CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Maria, thanks for having me on this morning.BARTIROMO: Are there any plans on the part of the administration to react to what's taking place in Hong Kong?SHORT: Well, Maria, I think the administration has spoken out several times talking about the need to resolve this peacefully. And calling on both the protesters and the Chinese government to resolve it peacefully. This is agreement that was signed 35 years ago to make sure that the situation in Hong Kong is one that the China respects the independence and we're calling on China again to make sure that they help to make sure that this is resolved peacefully that people have the right to protest and that those are preserved and protected.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, you know, one of the issues is that this is a lot of young people Marc, and they're looking at their future. And they're saying I don't want to be under authoritarian rule. That's not why I'm in Hong Kong. As China seems to be breaking another promise toward keeping Hong Kong independent which was the promise in the hand over to the British.SHORT: Right. Well, I don't want to get too far ahead, Maria. I think that we agree that they need to make sure that those the agreement they signed with the Brits are -- is maintained and protected. And I think that that's an indication as to how they will conduct other agreements across the globe when other -- in other trade deals and other agreements.I think that this administration has spoken out and you heard the vice president just a couple weeks ago and important speech lay out a lot of our concerns of the Communist Party of China is not entered into sort of the 21st century and not entered into agreements on the national stage. Yet at the same time, we recognize the China is a -- is a global power and we need to make sure that we're finding ways to move forward with them in a constructive pathway.But there's no doubt that there's a lot of concerns of this administration has expressed about China's affront on human rights abuses, as well as where it is on a national security perspective, the threats that oppose the peaceful nations.BARTIROMO: Yes. And frankly, you know, President Trump and Vice President Pence have completely changed the conversation on this. You know, we had - - we had a survivor of Tiananmen Square on the set earlier, Rose Tang, and she said that there are naked bodies floating in the river that there are mysterious disappearances of people and she went on to say that, you know this -- the Uyghurs are in concentration camps.Do all -- do any of these human abuses come into the conversation as the leadership of the country, President Trump, Vice President Pence are trying to do a trade deal with China. Does this matter that the fact that you've got almost two million Muslims in in concentration camps right now because they're not allowed to be Muslim, they want to follow the Chinese leadership, want them to be Chinese?SHORT: Absolutely, Maria. I think that it's become part of the conversation and again, the Vice President's speeches a couple weeks ago for your viewers too, he talked about the persecution of the Uyghur Muslims as well as persecution of Christians and the human rights abuses that happened in China. And as you recall, he made a very simple comment, in fact about as well that the NBA came down on one of the general managers for the Houston Rockets who was standing with the people of Hong Kong and he was silenced.And I think there's an irony that a lot of the people who are persecuted in China are sent away to concentration camps as you say, never to be heard from again, but here in America, if you speak out, then you get silenced and shame. So we do -- we do with the submission has spoken out, and it continues to speak out. But at the same time, I think there's a recognition that we can't decouple the economies entirely.And so guess, we're speaking out and saying, we want to see these abuses fixed. But it's not -- it's not a retreat that says we can't still have trade deals. It's just that we want to make sure that human rights abuses are acknowledged. We want to make sure that they're fixed. We want to make sure as well that so many of the things that China's on economic front from cheating on trade deals and devaluing is currency that those are resolved too.BARTIROMO: All right. Let me bring it back to the United States domestic issues. The President is expected to speak later today at the economic club of New York. Fox Business is carrying that speech live. I'll be there as well. What should we expect to hear from the President today?SHORT: Well, Maria, I think that we have a lot to be proud of that since Donald Trump has been elected president, more close to seven million new jobs and then create in this economy, unemployment's all-time lows for African-Americans, all-time lows for Hispanic Americans, all-time lows for Asian-Americans. This economy continues to be a booming economy.In addition, wage increases is something that we probably don't speak about enough. But despite inflation being low, we've seen significant rise in wage increases, particularly for those in the middle income sector. So there's a lot that we can talk about. The press I think will talk about the benefits of the anti-regulatory agenda, this administration, as well as tax reform, and I think he'll give a signal ahead as to what we can expect on the trade front.As you've covered many times while Congress continues to pursue sham investigations. What it means is they've not done the things, they promised voters they would do in 2018. They promise they work with this administration on lowering drug prices. They promise they work with this on infrastructure, and they also promise they work with us on trade deals. And we remain anxious to complete some of these trade deals to keep this economy going.BARTIROMO: Yes. You mentioned the stronger wages. Wages are up over the last year and the economy is growing. Partly the needle moved as a result of the President's policies, no doubt about it. But people are worried about the consumer. We got retail sales coming out later this week. Wal- Mart is going to be reporting its earnings as well. Do you see any cracks in the consumer right now, Marc?SHORT: No, I think in fact, just this month, the consumer sentiment number was strong again, we remain encouraged by that. And, you know, another statistic, Maria, is that the average family since Donald Trump was elected has seen income increased by $5,000 per year. That's a remarkable number. And so we think that that's continuing to fuel a lot of the consumer sentiment this country.BARTIROMO: But as you know, there are worries that everything that the President and this administration has done to lift all boats in terms of the economy and his deregulation efforts may be taken away because of the tariffs. President Trump reportedly expected to once again delay tariffs on European autos. What can you say about that? He could announce those plans during his speech today.The European Union now commenting on the development but if we were to get a tariff on European autos going into the very busy holiday season, wouldn't that be a big negative for the economy? Is the President going to announce that he'll delay that?SHORT: Well, Maria, you know, I can't get in front of the President on that. So I think you have to stay tuned for his remarks. But I think that so far, what you've seen is this President has been able to reset many of the trade deals in which countries were taking advantage of the United States and try to provide a fair or more level playing field to protect the workers in this country.And he's been able to do it with the economy continuing to grow. And so, I have confidence that will continue to be the case. I think what stands in front of us, though, is again, one of the largest trade deals are two largest exporters are Canada and Mexico, and we have a trade deal in place but rather than actually passing legislation that will help the American people, Democrats want to stay focused on sham investigations. That's the first thing we can actually do to continue to improve the trade front.BARTIROMO: Yes. I -- you make a good point. I mean, at this point, Nancy Pelosi said that she said on a path to yes. Should we read into that that USMCA is going to come to the floor by year end?SHORT: We're hopeful it will, Maria. I think that some of us are more cynical this process think that she's facing a lot of pressure from many of her moderate democrats who need to show that they're willing to work with this administration. And I think she's probably using this leverage on the impeachment vote. So, I think probably the timing of those two will be pretty close. And so we would hope that it would be done by the end of this year.But it's a pretty cynical way to run this Congress, when in fact, there's legislation that can help American workers and help the middle class but basically, it's being used as leverage with impeachment votes.BARTIROMO: Well, the impeachment is on. They're going to do public hearings this week. Democrats want to make a case that the President pressured Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son over the allegations of corruption. The President tweeted this morning, I will be releasing the transcript of the first and therefore more important phone call with Ukrainian president before weeks end.So, is there any reason to believe that, you know, the President's first phone call and that transcript is going to put him in a worse position?SHORT: Oh, no, I think that releasing that transcript only will benefit the president. But Maria, for your viewers, just to pull back for a second. You know, this administration has made the case that it's a sham investigation and more or less the star chamber because the head of the investigation, Adam Schiff, has lied to the American people about cooperating with the whistleblower.He's providing fake testimony in front of his committee and the American people, they've not allowed due process for our administration to provide witnesses to this point, or to see the evidence has been brought forward. That's a total sham and people in America will know what is fair and what's not fair. But pull back for a second and when you get past the process, step back and say, so this is an impeachment about money that was released within the fiscal year about claiming a cover-up when the President has provided the entire transcript for all the American people to read?And the President Ukraine said he felt no pressure or whatsoever from the president. I think it's kind of hard for American people to say, this is what you're pursuing, instead of lowering my drug prices, instead of getting legislation done to help our infrastructure, instead of passing trade deals, I think that's a very difficult situation. I think the Democrats have put themselves in.BARTIROMO: Well, the President has been, you know, walking on eggshells from the beginning of his -- of his presidency, whether it'd be the steel dossier and the efforts to frame him, or what Nikki Haley told us, you know, she's embracing President Trump as she promotes her new book. Is there any truth to the recording reports that she's eyeing a spot as Trump's vice president in 2020?SHORT: Oh, I think that this vice president and this president enjoy a remarkable relationship that has benefited the American people. And we look forward to them being on the ticket together in 2020. And the Vice President has been pleased to accept the President's invitation to do that.BARTIROMO: But what about the deep state? How significant are these people within the White House that are against this president, Nikki Haley is telling the story about how, you know, Rex Tillerson and John Kelly basically pressured her to go along with them to go against the president and his policies?SHORT: Well, look, I think that General Kelly is an American hero and I think that, you know, this weekend we honor our veterans and we honor his service to our country, we honor the fact that his son died in service to our country on this weekend. And so, I never witnessed that from John Kelly and I -- and I can't speak to the relationship she had with Rex Tillerson, but certainly, I never witnessed that from John Kelly.BARTIROMO: All right. Marc, we look forward to all of the above. The President speaking today. And of course, the ramp up to 2020. Good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.SHORT: Thanks, Maria. Thanks for having me on.BARTIROMO: Marc Short is at the White House this morning. Coming up. The strength of the U.S. economy. President Trump gears up to speak at the Economic Club of New York today. The Chief of Staff to Vice President Mike Pence, Marc Short just told us, the President will discuss wage increases, benefits of an antiregulatory agenda and tax reform. Stuart Varney weighs in on that.And then, Wendy's celebrate its 50th Birthday unveiling its first all new frosty flavor ever. We've got the scoop. Back in a minuteBARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump will speak later today in New York at the Economic Club of New York. Fox Business will carry that speech live. Investors are watching for any comments on the trade talks with China. Joining me right now as the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney to weigh in here. Hey, Stu, good morning.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I'm jealous, Maria. I am profoundly jealous because you're going to be there. And I'm not. It's six blocks up the road here in the Hilton Hotel. He starts at 12 noon. I can't get there in time because my show ends at 12:00 noon. And the Secret Service says you got to be there at 11:00 to go to the metal detectors. So, I can go and you can.BARTIROMO: Yes.(CROSSTALK)VARNEY: What are you going to save yourself?BARTIROMO: I'm also a member of the New York Economic Club. So I go to a lot of these things.VARNEY: Oh, OK. Well, I don't. Oh, I'm not.BARTIROMO: Yes. Going to be invested from the beginning thing now.VARNEY: OK, OK, OK. This could be a market mover, Maria. And I'm sure you'll agree with that.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: Whatever he says on trade, one way or the other, I think will move the market. And I think he's going to use this speech as sort of a campaign focus for the next year, as he -- as he tries to keep the prosperity rolling as you get towards the next election. I think this is probably the single most important economic speech of the year, if not his first term. What do you say?BARTIROMO: Yes. I think you're right, Stu, because it's all good news when you look at the impact on the economy, right? Whether it be the deregulation efforts, his -- remember that shot of him when he had all the -- all the rules and regulations piled up? You were there that day I think. You were there with him.VARNEY: Didn't you go? It was in 2016 I think when he addressed the economic club and he just unleashed a tirade against China.BARTIROMO: That's right.VARNEY: Now he's coming back, maybe with some news on positive trade developments with China, it's fantastic, isn't it, Maria?BARTIROMO: That will be what we're going to be focused on.VARNEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: What he has to say about China. We'll see about that. Stu, we'll be watching market reaction and I'll be tweeting about it. How's that?VARNEY: OK.BARTIROMO: And I'll text you as well.VARNEY: You're wrong. You're wrong.BARTIROMO: I'll text you from the stage.VARNEY: You're wrong. I'll take it.BARTIROMO: Thanks, Stu. I know you'll have a lot more in 10 minutes.VARNEY: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll see you at the top of the hour. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNING WITH MARIA. But first, wicked weather slamming the United States. Hundreds of flights have been canceled in the U.S. Thousands of delays affecting travelers. The very latest forecast when we come back. Plus, this, Wendy's celebrates its 50th birthday unveiling its first all-new frosty flavor ever. We've got the scoop after this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. An arctic blast is coming. Several parts of the country being slammed right now by bitter cold conditions and snow. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I was saying Winter is coming now. Winter is here. We could see records today, Maria, shattered freezing temps like any much of the country. Nearly six inches of snow already fell in Chicago yesterday and a plane slid off an icy runway over O'Hare.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh. No, no, no, no. Oh. Hey.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we landed.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Yes. They landed eventually. Well, the gear snapped on this American Airlines flight. Nobody was hurt but the incident and the weather caused more than 2000 flight cancellations throughout the Chicago area. Snow falling as far, south as Arkansas, the cold weather pushing East right now bundle up New York City.All right. Amazon is growing its grocery business. The company is opening its first low-cost store in Los Angeles. They're going to stand apart from the upscale Whole Foods they think which Amazon of course bought in 2017. Digital stores expected to open in Chicago and Philadelphia. There's Amazon of the premarket pretty much flat. A little bit of green on your screen.And then there is this. Wendy's is celebrating the big 5-0, with the birthday cake flavored frosty. Oh yes. First new flavor since Wendy's introduced those originals which as, you know, Maria, come in chocolate and vanilla. All I can say is send it back to you as yes, please.BARTIROMO: That's good. Thanks, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: We got final thoughts from this all-star panel when we come right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts in this all-star panel right here. What are you thinking about?TENGLER: I'm thinking about the next 12 months. Earnings, we got out of it alive, this last quarter, we got an earnings risk premium that bodes well for stocks in the future. We've had three rate cuts. That is -- if it's a pause at this point, that's good for stocks. So I think this has bit to run, acts any kind of impeachment.BARTIROMO: We'll see what the president says today, Nancy.TENGLER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Cab, what about you?PHILLIPS: Thinking about the demonization of wealth in America, every democrat candidate is trying as hard as they can to make it seem like you're an evil person. If you amass wealth, I think free market advocates need to do a better job of reminding the next generation. It's not a zero sum game.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, UK's FTSE lost 0.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -59.25 at 27955.72, Nasdaq -3.82 at 8652.71, S&P -1.81 at 3144.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade near its flat line, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be brewing ahead of some notable events, including the Dec. 15 tariffs.Other key events will include policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday, and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday. Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61. This is still a relatively low level, but the sharp increase has reflected a hedging mentality among some investors.11:00 ETDow -33.94 at 27981.03, Nasdaq +9.89 at 8666.42, S&P +1.21 at 3147.12[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has embarked on a sideways path that has inspired few in the market today. The benchmark index is up 0.1%.Shares of Canopy Growth (CGC 21.12, +2.47, +13.1%) are riding high after the company named David Klein as its newest CEO effective Jan. 14. Mr. Klein is currently the executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands (STZ 181.07, -2.58, -1.4%).Separately, Amazon (AMZN 1759.45, +7.85, +0.5%) has accused President Trump of "interference" in the Pentagon cloud computing contract that was awarded to Microsoft (MSFT 151.69, -0.05, unch), according to CNBC.10:25 ETDow -27.26 at 27987.71, Nasdaq +14.12 at 8670.65, S&P +1.18 at 3147.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades just above its flat line while investors look over some M&A activity.ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) has agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for $20 per share in cash or about $2.7 billion. It's a huge premium, which has doubled shares of the biotechnology company today.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 63.91, +6.02, +10.4%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 62.04, +2.78, +4.7%) have agreed to combine in a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.09:55 ETDow -11.89 at 28003.08, Nasdaq +19.00 at 8675.53, S&P +1.99 at 3147.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 trades higher by 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades flat.Shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1353.80, +13.18, +1.0%) have pushed higher into uncharted territory today on no specific news driver. On a related note, Barron's published a positive report on the holding company and its new CEO Sundar Pichai.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+0.5%), which is home to Alphabet, is outperforming the broader market.09:40 ETDow -33.17 at 27981.8, Nasdaq +1.95 at 8658.48, S&P -2.80 at 3143.11[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices begin the day little changed. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy (-0.8%) and industrials (-0.3%) sectors as today's early laggards, while the materials (+0.3%), communication services (+0.3%), and consumer discretionary (+0.2%) sectors outperform.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.61. WTI crude is down 0.7% to $58.76/bbl.09:11 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -3.60. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -14.60.Wall Street is gearing up for a muted start, with the S&P 500 futures trading four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. The tranquility in the futures trade has coincided with no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front and no economic data, but this week could include some noteworthy events.Both the Fed and ECB will hold policy meetings, but no changes in policy are expected. The market, meanwhile, continues to hope that some sort of deal between the U.S. and China will be announced before the tariffs on consumer goods hit on Dec. 15. Of course, some investors aren't convinced a deal may happen.Key reports this week will include the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday. Last week saw a stronger-than-expected employment report that helped the S&P 500 approach today less than nine points from its all-time high.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -3.90. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -14.10.The S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region began the week on a modestly higher, but quiet note. Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices. Reports from Japan suggest that the Bank of Japan will lower its assessment of industrial production amid prolonged weakness. Japan's Q3 GDP was revised higher while China's November trade surplus was smaller than expected.In economic data: China's November trade surplus $38.73 bln (expected $46.30 bln; last $43.02 bln).

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -7.50.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value following a quiet weekend in news, muted sessions in Asia and Europe, and a dearth of earnings reports today. The benchmark index enters this week less than nine points from its all-time high.With no economic reports set to be released today, either, the market will remain focused on any U.S.-China trade progress ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs. Central bank meetings have also crept into the market's radar, although no change is policy is expected from either the Fed on Wednesday or the ECB on Thursday.In the health care space, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.10, +1.15, +1.9%) has pleased investors with data for a cancer treatment while ArQule (ARQL 19.53, +9.87, +102.3%) has agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for $20 per share or about $2.7 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed this morning.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs.

The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note.

Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, UK's FTSE lost 0.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -59.25 at 27955.72, Nasdaq -3.82 at 8652.71, S&P -1.81 at 3144.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade near its flat line, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be brewing ahead of some notable events, including the Dec. 15 tariffs.Other key events will include policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday, and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday. Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61. This is still a relatively low level, but the sharp increase has reflected a hedging mentality among some investors.11:00 ETDow -33.94 at 27981.03, Nasdaq +9.89 at 8666.42, S&P +1.21 at 3147.12[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has embarked on a sideways path that has inspired few in the market today. The benchmark index is up 0.1%.Shares of Canopy Growth (CGC 21.12, +2.47, +13.1%) are riding high after the company named David Klein as its newest CEO effective Jan. 14. Mr. Klein is currently the executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands (STZ 181.07, -2.58, -1.4%).Separately, Amazon (AMZN 1759.45, +7.85, +0.5%) has accused President Trump of "interference" in the Pentagon cloud computing contract that was awarded to Microsoft (MSFT 151.69, -0.05, unch), according to CNBC.10:25 ETDow -27.26 at 27987.71, Nasdaq +14.12 at 8670.65, S&P +1.18 at 3147.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades just above its flat line while investors look over some M&A activity.ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) has agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for $20 per share in cash or about $2.7 billion.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion.

Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, UK's FTSE lost 0.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -59.25 at 27955.72, Nasdaq -3.82 at 8652.71, S&P -1.81 at 3144.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade near its flat line, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be brewing ahead of some notable events, including the Dec. 15 tariffs.Other key events will include policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday, and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday. Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61. This is still a relatively low level, but the sharp increase has reflected a hedging mentality among some investors.11:00 ETDow -33.94 at 27981.03, Nasdaq +9.89 at 8666.42, S&P +1.21 at 3147.12[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has embarked on a sideways path that has inspired few in the market today.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

There remains no reported progress in trade talks, though, which has contributed to the muted price action today.Looking ahead, Toll Brothers (TOL 41.43, +0.55, +1.4%) and Chewy (CHWY 24.06, -0.90, -3.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close. AutoZone (AZO 1168.78, -3.88, -0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -87.62 at 27927.35, Nasdaq -24.35 at 8632.18, S&P -7.64 at 3138.27[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trend slightly lower with a loss of 0.3%.Shares of International Flavors (IFF 132.30, -9.74, -6.9%) have dropped nearly 7% after Bloomberg reported that the company is mulling a potential $25 billion bid for DuPont's (DD 64.01, +0.42, +0.7%) nutrition unit.Conversely, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 12.19, +0.54, +4.6%) are seeing increased buying interest after UBS raised its price target to $14.50 from $12. The firm maintained its Buy rating on the stock.14:00 ETDow -65.09 at 27949.88, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8644.05, S&P -4.57 at 3141.34[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains near session lows with a 0.2% decline.Gold settled today's session down $0.20 (-0.01%) at $1464.9/oz, while silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (+0.2%) at $16.65/oz. Like the broader market, there was little conviction in trading precious metals in front of a series of notable events this week.The U.S. Dollar Index is currently little changed at 97.66.13:30 ETDow -77.02 at 27937.95, Nasdaq -12.43 at 8644.1, S&P -4.37 at 3141.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices are near their worst levels of the day as stocks drift lower in a mostly uneventful start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Apple (AAPL 266.69, -4.01), Goldman Sachs (GS 222.18, -2.43), & Walt Disney (DIS 146.04, -1.62) are underperforming. Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, UK's FTSE lost 0.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -59.25 at 27955.72, Nasdaq -3.82 at 8652.71, S&P -1.81 at 3144.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade near its flat line, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be brewing ahead of some notable events, including the Dec. 15 tariffs.Other key events will include policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday, and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday. Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61. This is still a relatively low level, but the sharp increase has reflected a hedging mentality among some investors.11:00 ETDow -33.94 at 27981.03, Nasdaq +9.89 at 8666.42, S&P +1.21 at 3147.12[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has embarked on a sideways path that has inspired few in the market today.

The tranquility in the futures trade has coincided with no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front and no economic data, but this week could include some noteworthy events.Both the Fed and ECB will hold policy meetings, but no changes in policy are expected. The market, meanwhile, continues to hope that some sort of deal between the U.S. and China will be announced before the tariffs on consumer goods hit on Dec. 15. Of course, some investors aren't convinced a deal may happen.Key reports this week will include the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday.

The benchmark index enters this week less than nine points from its all-time high.With no economic reports set to be released today, either, the market will remain focused on any U.S.-China trade progress ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs. Central bank meetings have also crept into the market's radar, although no change is policy is expected from either the Fed on Wednesday or the ECB on Thursday.In the health care space, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.10, +1.15, +1.9%) has pleased investors with data for a cancer treatment while ArQule (ARQL 19.53, +9.87, +102.3%) has agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for $20 per share or about $2.7 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed this morning.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

There remains no reported progress in trade talks, though, which has contributed to the muted price action today.Looking ahead, Toll Brothers (TOL 41.43, +0.55, +1.4%) and Chewy (CHWY 24.06, -0.90, -3.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close. AutoZone (AZO 1168.78, -3.88, -0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -87.62 at 27927.35, Nasdaq -24.35 at 8632.18, S&P -7.64 at 3138.27[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trend slightly lower with a loss of 0.3%.Shares of International Flavors (IFF 132.30, -9.74, -6.9%) have dropped nearly 7% after Bloomberg reported that the company is mulling a potential $25 billion bid for DuPont's (DD 64.01, +0.42, +0.7%) nutrition unit.Conversely, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 12.19, +0.54, +4.6%) are seeing increased buying interest after UBS raised its price target to $14.50 from $12. The firm maintained its Buy rating on the stock.14:00 ETDow -65.09 at 27949.88, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8644.05, S&P -4.57 at 3141.34[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains near session lows with a 0.2% decline.Gold settled today's session down $0.20 (-0.01%) at $1464.9/oz, while silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (+0.2%) at $16.65/oz. Like the broader market, there was little conviction in trading precious metals in front of a series of notable events this week.The U.S. Dollar Index is currently little changed at 97.66.13:30 ETDow -77.02 at 27937.95, Nasdaq -12.43 at 8644.1, S&P -4.37 at 3141.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices are near their worst levels of the day as stocks drift lower in a mostly uneventful start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Apple (AAPL 266.69, -4.01), Goldman Sachs (GS 222.18, -2.43), & Walt Disney (DIS 146.04, -1.62) are underperforming. Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, UK's FTSE lost 0.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -59.25 at 27955.72, Nasdaq -3.82 at 8652.71, S&P -1.81 at 3144.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade near its flat line, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be brewing ahead of some notable events, including the Dec. 15 tariffs.Other key events will include policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday, and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday. Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61. This is still a relatively low level, but the sharp increase has reflected a hedging mentality among some investors.11:00 ETDow -33.94 at 27981.03, Nasdaq +9.89 at 8666.42, S&P +1.21 at 3147.12[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has embarked on a sideways path that has inspired few in the market today.

The tranquility in the futures trade has coincided with no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front and no economic data, but this week could include some noteworthy events.Both the Fed and ECB will hold policy meetings, but no changes in policy are expected. The market, meanwhile, continues to hope that some sort of deal between the U.S. and China will be announced before the tariffs on consumer goods hit on Dec. 15. Of course, some investors aren't convinced a deal may happen.Key reports this week will include the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -7.50.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value following a quiet weekend in news, muted sessions in Asia and Europe, and a dearth of earnings reports today. The benchmark index enters this week less than nine points from its all-time high.With no economic reports set to be released today, either, the market will remain focused on any U.S.-China trade progress ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs. Central bank meetings have also crept into the market's radar, although no change is policy is expected from either the Fed on Wednesday or the ECB on Thursday.In the health care space, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.10, +1.15, +1.9%) has pleased investors with data for a cancer treatment while ArQule (ARQL 19.53, +9.87, +102.3%) has agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for $20 per share or about $2.7 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed this morning.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

There remains no reported progress in trade talks, though, which has contributed to the muted price action today.Looking ahead, Toll Brothers (TOL 41.43, +0.55, +1.4%) and Chewy (CHWY 24.06, -0.90, -3.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close. AutoZone (AZO 1168.78, -3.88, -0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -87.62 at 27927.35, Nasdaq -24.35 at 8632.18, S&P -7.64 at 3138.27[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trend slightly lower with a loss of 0.3%.Shares of International Flavors (IFF 132.30, -9.74, -6.9%) have dropped nearly 7% after Bloomberg reported that the company is mulling a potential $25 billion bid for DuPont's (DD 64.01, +0.42, +0.7%) nutrition unit.Conversely, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 12.19, +0.54, +4.6%) are seeing increased buying interest after UBS raised its price target to $14.50 from $12. The firm maintained its Buy rating on the stock.14:00 ETDow -65.09 at 27949.88, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8644.05, S&P -4.57 at 3141.34[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains near session lows with a 0.2% decline.Gold settled today's session down $0.20 (-0.01%) at $1464.9/oz, while silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (+0.2%) at $16.65/oz. Like the broader market, there was little conviction in trading precious metals in front of a series of notable events this week.The U.S. Dollar Index is currently little changed at 97.66.13:30 ETDow -77.02 at 27937.95, Nasdaq -12.43 at 8644.1, S&P -4.37 at 3141.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices are near their worst levels of the day as stocks drift lower in a mostly uneventful start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Apple (AAPL 266.69, -4.01), Goldman Sachs (GS 222.18, -2.43), & Walt Disney (DIS 146.04, -1.62) are underperforming. Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, UK's FTSE lost 0.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -59.25 at 27955.72, Nasdaq -3.82 at 8652.71, S&P -1.81 at 3144.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade near its flat line, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be brewing ahead of some notable events, including the Dec. 15 tariffs.Other key events will include policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday, and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday. Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61. This is still a relatively low level, but the sharp increase has reflected a hedging mentality among some investors.11:00 ETDow -33.94 at 27981.03, Nasdaq +9.89 at 8666.42, S&P +1.21 at 3147.12[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has embarked on a sideways path that has inspired few in the market today.

The tranquility in the futures trade has coincided with no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front and no economic data, but this week could include some noteworthy events.Both the Fed and ECB will hold policy meetings, but no changes in policy are expected. The market, meanwhile, continues to hope that some sort of deal between the U.S. and China will be announced before the tariffs on consumer goods hit on Dec. 15. Of course, some investors aren't convinced a deal may happen.Key reports this week will include the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

There remains no reported progress in trade talks, though, which has contributed to the muted price action today.Looking ahead, Toll Brothers (TOL 41.43, +0.55, +1.4%) and Chewy (CHWY 24.06, -0.90, -3.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close. AutoZone (AZO 1168.78, -3.88, -0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -87.62 at 27927.35, Nasdaq -24.35 at 8632.18, S&P -7.64 at 3138.27[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trend slightly lower with a loss of 0.3%.Shares of International Flavors (IFF 132.30, -9.74, -6.9%) have dropped nearly 7% after Bloomberg reported that the company is mulling a potential $25 billion bid for DuPont's (DD 64.01, +0.42, +0.7%) nutrition unit.Conversely, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 12.19, +0.54, +4.6%) are seeing increased buying interest after UBS raised its price target to $14.50 from $12. The firm maintained its Buy rating on the stock.14:00 ETDow -65.09 at 27949.88, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8644.05, S&P -4.57 at 3141.34[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains near session lows with a 0.2% decline.Gold settled today's session down $0.20 (-0.01%) at $1464.9/oz, while silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (+0.2%) at $16.65/oz. Like the broader market, there was little conviction in trading precious metals in front of a series of notable events this week.The U.S. Dollar Index is currently little changed at 97.66.13:30 ETDow -77.02 at 27937.95, Nasdaq -12.43 at 8644.1, S&P -4.37 at 3141.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices are near their worst levels of the day as stocks drift lower in a mostly uneventful start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Apple (AAPL 266.69, -4.01), Goldman Sachs (GS 222.18, -2.43), & Walt Disney (DIS 146.04, -1.62) are underperforming. Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note.

Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61. This is still a relatively low level, but the sharp increase has reflected a hedging mentality among some investors.11:00 ETDow -33.94 at 27981.03, Nasdaq +9.89 at 8666.42, S&P +1.21 at 3147.12[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has embarked on a sideways path that has inspired few in the market today.

The market, meanwhile, continues to hope that some sort of deal between the U.S. and China will be announced before the tariffs on consumer goods hit on Dec. 15. Of course, some investors aren't convinced a deal may happen.Key reports this week will include the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -7.50.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value following a quiet weekend in news, muted sessions in Asia and Europe, and a dearth of earnings reports today. The benchmark index enters this week less than nine points from its all-time high.With no economic reports set to be released today, either, the market will remain focused on any U.S.-China trade progress ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs. Central bank meetings have also crept into the market's radar, although no change is policy is expected from either the Fed on Wednesday or the ECB on Thursday.In the health care space, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.10, +1.15, +1.9%) has pleased investors with data for a cancer treatment while ArQule (ARQL 19.53, +9.87, +102.3%) has agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for $20 per share or about $2.7 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed this morning.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

There remains no reported progress in trade talks, though, which has contributed to the muted price action today.Looking ahead, Toll Brothers (TOL 41.43, +0.55, +1.4%) and Chewy (CHWY 24.06, -0.90, -3.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close. AutoZone (AZO 1168.78, -3.88, -0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -87.62 at 27927.35, Nasdaq -24.35 at 8632.18, S&P -7.64 at 3138.27[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trend slightly lower with a loss of 0.3%.Shares of International Flavors (IFF 132.30, -9.74, -6.9%) have dropped nearly 7% after Bloomberg reported that the company is mulling a potential $25 billion bid for DuPont's (DD 64.01, +0.42, +0.7%) nutrition unit.Conversely, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 12.19, +0.54, +4.6%) are seeing increased buying interest after UBS raised its price target to $14.50 from $12. The firm maintained its Buy rating on the stock.14:00 ETDow -65.09 at 27949.88, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8644.05, S&P -4.57 at 3141.34[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains near session lows with a 0.2% decline.Gold settled today's session down $0.20 (-0.01%) at $1464.9/oz, while silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (+0.2%) at $16.65/oz. Like the broader market, there was little conviction in trading precious metals in front of a series of notable events this week.The U.S. Dollar Index is currently little changed at 97.66.13:30 ETDow -77.02 at 27937.95, Nasdaq -12.43 at 8644.1, S&P -4.37 at 3141.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices are near their worst levels of the day as stocks drift lower in a mostly uneventful start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Apple (AAPL 266.69, -4.01), Goldman Sachs (GS 222.18, -2.43), & Walt Disney (DIS 146.04, -1.62) are underperforming. Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, UK's FTSE lost 0.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -59.25 at 27955.72, Nasdaq -3.82 at 8652.71, S&P -1.81 at 3144.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade near its flat line, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be brewing ahead of some notable events, including the Dec. 15 tariffs.Other key events will include policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday, and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday. Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61. This is still a relatively low level, but the sharp increase has reflected a hedging mentality among some investors.11:00 ETDow -33.94 at 27981.03, Nasdaq +9.89 at 8666.42, S&P +1.21 at 3147.12[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has embarked on a sideways path that has inspired few in the market today.

The tranquility in the futures trade has coincided with no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front and no economic data, but this week could include some noteworthy events.Both the Fed and ECB will hold policy meetings, but no changes in policy are expected. The market, meanwhile, continues to hope that some sort of deal between the U.S. and China will be announced before the tariffs on consumer goods hit on Dec. 15. Of course, some investors aren't convinced a deal may happen.Key reports this week will include the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday.

Central bank meetings have also crept into the market's radar, although no change is policy is expected from either the Fed on Wednesday or the ECB on Thursday.In the health care space, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.10, +1.15, +1.9%) has pleased investors with data for a cancer treatment while ArQule (ARQL 19.53, +9.87, +102.3%) has agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for $20 per share or about $2.7 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed this morning.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

There remains no reported progress in trade talks, though, which has contributed to the muted price action today.Looking ahead, Toll Brothers (TOL 41.43, +0.55, +1.4%) and Chewy (CHWY 24.06, -0.90, -3.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close. AutoZone (AZO 1168.78, -3.88, -0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -87.62 at 27927.35, Nasdaq -24.35 at 8632.18, S&P -7.64 at 3138.27[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trend slightly lower with a loss of 0.3%.Shares of International Flavors (IFF 132.30, -9.74, -6.9%) have dropped nearly 7% after Bloomberg reported that the company is mulling a potential $25 billion bid for DuPont's (DD 64.01, +0.42, +0.7%) nutrition unit.Conversely, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 12.19, +0.54, +4.6%) are seeing increased buying interest after UBS raised its price target to $14.50 from $12. The firm maintained its Buy rating on the stock.14:00 ETDow -65.09 at 27949.88, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8644.05, S&P -4.57 at 3141.34[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains near session lows with a 0.2% decline.Gold settled today's session down $0.20 (-0.01%) at $1464.9/oz, while silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (+0.2%) at $16.65/oz. Like the broader market, there was little conviction in trading precious metals in front of a series of notable events this week.The U.S. Dollar Index is currently little changed at 97.66.13:30 ETDow -77.02 at 27937.95, Nasdaq -12.43 at 8644.1, S&P -4.37 at 3141.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices are near their worst levels of the day as stocks drift lower in a mostly uneventful start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Apple (AAPL 266.69, -4.01), Goldman Sachs (GS 222.18, -2.43), & Walt Disney (DIS 146.04, -1.62) are underperforming. Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note.

Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61. This is still a relatively low level, but the sharp increase has reflected a hedging mentality among some investors.11:00 ETDow -33.94 at 27981.03, Nasdaq +9.89 at 8666.42, S&P +1.21 at 3147.12[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has embarked on a sideways path that has inspired few in the market today.

The tranquility in the futures trade has coincided with no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front and no economic data, but this week could include some noteworthy events.Both the Fed and ECB will hold policy meetings, but no changes in policy are expected. The market, meanwhile, continues to hope that some sort of deal between the U.S. and China will be announced before the tariffs on consumer goods hit on Dec. 15. Of course, some investors aren't convinced a deal may happen.Key reports this week will include the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday.

The benchmark index enters this week less than nine points from its all-time high.With no economic reports set to be released today, either, the market will remain focused on any U.S.-China trade progress ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 declined 0.3%.The lack of conviction was understandable considering that there was no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs, which would presumably upset the market if they went into effect without a Phase One deal. There is still some time left this week to strike a deal, but the trade uncertainty helped keep risk sentiment in check.Losses were made most prevalent in the S&P 500 health care (-0.7%), utilities (-0.5%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors. The latter was pressured by Apple (AAPL 266.92, -3.79, -1.4%), which pulled back from record territory. Conversely, the consumer staples (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and consumer discretionary (+0.1%) sectors finished higher.Other key events this week will include policy decisions from both the Fed and ECB, a UK election, and reports on consumer prices and retail sales for November. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index spiked 16.5% to 15.86, as demand for downside protection increased in anticipation for any disappoints.Corporate news didn't move the needle, but M&A activity and analyst recommendations did contribute to some notable stock reactions.In the biotech space, ArQule (ARQL 19.71, +10.04, +103.9%) agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.72, -0.13, -0.2%) for about $2.7 billion in cash. Synthorx (THOR 67.71, +42.68, +170.5%) agreed to be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.30, -0.73, -1.6%) for about $2.4 billion in cash. Evidently, both deals came at handsome premiums.Apple suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 108.44, +1.82, +1.7%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.23, +1.87, +1.8%) outperformed after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch "double upgraded" the stocks to Buy from Underperform due to their 5G growth potential.U.S. Treasuries finished the session relatively unchanged. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.62%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.64. WTI crude declined 0.4%, or $0.23, to $58.97/bbl.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for November and the revised Q3 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.9% YTDS&P 500 +25.1% YTDRussell 2000 +20.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1488/1394. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1351/1768.15:20 ETDow -59.23 at 27955.74, Nasdaq -17.65 at 8638.88, S&P -4.84 at 3141.07[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is on pace to close the session little changed as it trades lower by 0.2%.Reviewing the S&P 500 sectors shows utilities (-0.5%), health care (-0.4%), and information technology (-0.3%) continuing to drag on the broader market, while the consumer staples (+0.3%), consumer discretionary (+0.3%), and real estate (+0.2%) sectors continue to hold modest gains.WTI crude settled down $0.23 (-0.4%) to $58.97/bbl in a marginal pullback from last week's 7% gain.14:55 ETDow -70.82 at 27944.15, Nasdaq -19.11 at 8637.42, S&P -5.72 at 3140.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 are both down 0.1% amid a lack of buying conviction.Reuters reported earlier that China recently purchased 300,000 tons of soybeans from the U.S. after it issued waivers on tariffs last week. There remains no reported progress in trade talks, though, which has contributed to the muted price action today.Looking ahead, Toll Brothers (TOL 41.43, +0.55, +1.4%) and Chewy (CHWY 24.06, -0.90, -3.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close. AutoZone (AZO 1168.78, -3.88, -0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -87.62 at 27927.35, Nasdaq -24.35 at 8632.18, S&P -7.64 at 3138.27[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trend slightly lower with a loss of 0.3%.Shares of International Flavors (IFF 132.30, -9.74, -6.9%) have dropped nearly 7% after Bloomberg reported that the company is mulling a potential $25 billion bid for DuPont's (DD 64.01, +0.42, +0.7%) nutrition unit.Conversely, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 12.19, +0.54, +4.6%) are seeing increased buying interest after UBS raised its price target to $14.50 from $12. The firm maintained its Buy rating on the stock.14:00 ETDow -65.09 at 27949.88, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8644.05, S&P -4.57 at 3141.34[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains near session lows with a 0.2% decline.Gold settled today's session down $0.20 (-0.01%) at $1464.9/oz, while silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (+0.2%) at $16.65/oz. Like the broader market, there was little conviction in trading precious metals in front of a series of notable events this week.The U.S. Dollar Index is currently little changed at 97.66.13:30 ETDow -77.02 at 27937.95, Nasdaq -12.43 at 8644.1, S&P -4.37 at 3141.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices are near their worst levels of the day as stocks drift lower in a mostly uneventful start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Apple (AAPL 266.69, -4.01), Goldman Sachs (GS 222.18, -2.43), & Walt Disney (DIS 146.04, -1.62) are underperforming. Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs. Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were "double" upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overall losses are very modest, but there has been a noticeable increase in hedging interest and an uptick in defensive positioning. The CBOE Volatility Index is up 9.4% to 14.90, while the benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.82%.Investors did not receive any notable economic data.12:25 ETDow -75.86 at 27939.11, Nasdaq -9.17 at 8647.36, S&P -3.69 at 3142.22[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has slipped to session lows, which is a slim 0.1% decline.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 265.16, -5.57, -2.1%) underperforming the widely-held group. Facebook (FB 202.47, +1.41, +0.7%), Alphabet (GOOG 1351.93, +11.31, +0.8%), and Amazon (AMZN 1758.27, +6.66, +0.9%) trade higher, while Netflix (NFLX 301.10, -0.25, -0.1%) trades little changed.On a related note, Apple was initiated with a buy at China Renaissance with a price target of $342.Separately, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.28, +1.32, +2.2%) are up more than 2% after the company released results for a new cancer treatment that met its primary and secondary endpoints.11:55 ETDow -69.91 at 27945.06, Nasdaq -7.34 at 8649.19, S&P -2.62 at 3143.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade lower by 0.1%. The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, UK's FTSE lost 0.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.2%.11:25 ETDow -59.25 at 27955.72, Nasdaq -3.82 at 8652.71, S&P -1.81 at 3144.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade near its flat line, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be brewing ahead of some notable events, including the Dec. 15 tariffs.Other key events will include policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday, and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday. Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61. This is still a relatively low level, but the sharp increase has reflected a hedging mentality among some investors.11:00 ETDow -33.94 at 27981.03, Nasdaq +9.89 at 8666.42, S&P +1.21 at 3147.12[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has embarked on a sideways path that has inspired few in the market today.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 declined 0.3%.The lack of conviction was understandable considering that there was no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs, which would presumably upset the market if they went into effect without a Phase One deal. There is still some time left this week to strike a deal, but the trade uncertainty helped keep risk sentiment in check.Losses were made most prevalent in the S&P 500 health care (-0.7%), utilities (-0.5%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors. The latter was pressured by Apple (AAPL 266.92, -3.79, -1.4%), which pulled back from record territory. Conversely, the consumer staples (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and consumer discretionary (+0.1%) sectors finished higher.Other key events this week will include policy decisions from both the Fed and ECB, a UK election, and reports on consumer prices and retail sales for November. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index spiked 15.4% to 15.71, as demand for downside protection increased in anticipation for any disappoints.Corporate news didn't move the needle, but M&A activity and analyst recommendations did contribute to some notable stock reactions.In the biotech space, ArQule (ARQL 19.71, +10.04, +103.9%) agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.72, -0.13, -0.2%) for about $2.7 billion in cash. Synthorx (THOR 67.71, +42.68, +170.5%) agreed to be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.30, -0.73, -1.6%) for about $2.4 billion in cash. Evidently, both deals came at handsome premiums.Apple suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 108.44, +1.82, +1.7%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.23, +1.87, +1.8%) outperformed after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch "double upgraded" the stocks to Buy from Underperform due to their 5G growth potential.U.S. Treasuries finished the session relatively unchanged. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.62%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.64. WTI crude declined 0.4%, or $0.23, to $58.97/bbl.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for November and the revised Q3 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.9% YTDS&P 500 +25.1% YTDRussell 2000 +20.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1488/1394. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1351/1768.15:20 ETDow -59.23 at 27955.74, Nasdaq -17.65 at 8638.88, S&P -4.84 at 3141.07[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is on pace to close the session little changed as it trades lower by 0.2%.Reviewing the S&P 500 sectors shows utilities (-0.5%), health care (-0.4%), and information technology (-0.3%) continuing to drag on the broader market, while the consumer staples (+0.3%), consumer discretionary (+0.3%), and real estate (+0.2%) sectors continue to hold modest gains.WTI crude settled down $0.23 (-0.4%) to $58.97/bbl in a marginal pullback from last week's 7% gain.14:55 ETDow -70.82 at 27944.15, Nasdaq -19.11 at 8637.42, S&P -5.72 at 3140.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 are both down 0.1% amid a lack of buying conviction.Reuters reported earlier that China recently purchased 300,000 tons of soybeans from the U.S. after it issued waivers on tariffs last week. There remains no reported progress in trade talks, though, which has contributed to the muted price action today.Looking ahead, Toll Brothers (TOL 41.43, +0.55, +1.4%) and Chewy (CHWY 24.06, -0.90, -3.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close. AutoZone (AZO 1168.78, -3.88, -0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -87.62 at 27927.35, Nasdaq -24.35 at 8632.18, S&P -7.64 at 3138.27[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trend slightly lower with a loss of 0.3%.Shares of International Flavors (IFF 132.30, -9.74, -6.9%) have dropped nearly 7% after Bloomberg reported that the company is mulling a potential $25 billion bid for DuPont's (DD 64.01, +0.42, +0.7%) nutrition unit.Conversely, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 12.19, +0.54, +4.6%) are seeing increased buying interest after UBS raised its price target to $14.50 from $12. The firm maintained its Buy rating on the stock.14:00 ETDow -65.09 at 27949.88, Nasdaq -12.48 at 8644.05, S&P -4.57 at 3141.34[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains near session lows with a 0.2% decline.Gold settled today's session down $0.20 (-0.01%) at $1464.9/oz, while silver settled today's session $0.04 higher (+0.2%) at $16.65/oz. Like the broader market, there was little conviction in trading precious metals in front of a series of notable events this week.The U.S. Dollar Index is currently little changed at 97.66.13:30 ETDow -77.02 at 27937.95, Nasdaq -12.43 at 8644.1, S&P -4.37 at 3141.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices are near their worst levels of the day as stocks drift lower in a mostly uneventful start to the trading week.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Apple (AAPL 266.69, -4.01), Goldman Sachs (GS 222.18, -2.43), & Walt Disney (DIS 146.04, -1.62) are underperforming. Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion. Synthorx (THOR 67.66, +42.63, +170.3%) will be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.35, -0.68, -1.5%) for about $2.4 billion. Both are cash deals.Elsewhere, Texas Capital (TCBI 62.92, +5.03, +8.9%) and Independent Bank Group (IBTX 61.01, +1.75, +3.0%) have agreed to a $5.5 billion all-stock merger of equals.Separately, shares of Macy's (M 15.58, +0.43, +2.8%) have defied a downgrade to Sell at Goldman Sachs.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 declined 0.3%.The lack of conviction was understandable considering that there was no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs, which would presumably upset the market if they went into effect without a Phase One deal. There is still some time left this week to strike a deal, but the trade uncertainty helped keep risk sentiment in check.Losses were made most prevalent in the S&P 500 health care (-0.7%), utilities (-0.5%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors. The latter was pressured by Apple (AAPL 266.92, -3.79, -1.4%), which pulled back from record territory. Conversely, the consumer staples (+0.2%), real estate (+0.1%), and consumer discretionary (+0.1%) sectors finished higher.Other key events this week will include policy decisions from both the Fed and ECB, a UK election, and reports on consumer prices and retail sales for November. Strikingly, the CBOE Volatility Index spiked 16.5% to 15.86, as demand for downside protection increased in anticipation for any disappoints.Corporate news didn't move the needle, but M&A activity and analyst recommendations did contribute to some notable stock reactions.In the biotech space, ArQule (ARQL 19.71, +10.04, +103.9%) agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.72, -0.13, -0.2%) for about $2.7 billion in cash. Synthorx (THOR 67.71, +42.68, +170.5%) agreed to be acquired by French company Sanofi (SNY 45.30, -0.73, -1.6%) for about $2.4 billion in cash. Evidently, both deals came at handsome premiums.Apple suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 108.44, +1.82, +1.7%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.23, +1.87, +1.8%) outperformed after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch "double upgraded" the stocks to Buy from Underperform due to their 5G growth potential.U.S. Treasuries finished the session relatively unchanged. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.62%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.64. WTI crude declined 0.4%, or $0.23, to $58.97/bbl.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for November and the revised Q3 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.9% YTDS&P 500 +25.1% YTDRussell 2000 +20.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1488/1394. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1351/1768.15:20 ETDow -59.23 at 27955.74, Nasdaq -17.65 at 8638.88, S&P -4.84 at 3141.07[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is on pace to close the session little changed as it trades lower by 0.2%.Reviewing the S&P 500 sectors shows utilities (-0.5%), health care (-0.4%), and information technology (-0.3%) continuing to drag on the broader market, while the consumer staples (+0.3%), consumer discretionary (+0.3%), and real estate (+0.2%) sectors continue to hold modest gains.WTI crude settled down $0.23 (-0.4%) to $58.97/bbl in a marginal pullback from last week's 7% gain.14:55 ETDow -70.82 at 27944.15, Nasdaq -19.11 at 8637.42, S&P -5.72 at 3140.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 are both down 0.1% amid a lack of buying conviction.Reuters reported earlier that China recently purchased 300,000 tons of soybeans from the U.S. after it issued waivers on tariffs last week. There remains no reported progress in trade talks, though, which has contributed to the muted price action today.Looking ahead, Toll Brothers (TOL 41.43, +0.55, +1.4%) and Chewy (CHWY 24.06, -0.90, -3.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close.

Apple shares are seeing outsized weakness amidst reports of critical comments from boutique firm Rosenblatt, which speculated on production cuts for the iPhone 11.Conversely, Home Depot (HD 217.00, +2.72) is the best-performing Dow component after Wells Fargo issued a note saying they are buyers heading into Wednesday's Investor Day, and reiterated their Outperform rating while lowering their price target from $260 to $240.For the month, the DJIA is currently down 0.38%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.632% on a bid-to-cover of 2.56.12:55 ETDow -85.43 at 27929.54, Nasdaq -14.50 at 8642.03, S&P -5.01 at 3140.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2% in midday action, as a wait-and-see mindset appears to be keeping risk sentiment in check after Friday's broad-based rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is unchanged.December 15 is fast approaching, and the market is hoping that the U.S. and China can reach a deal to possibly delay the tariffs scheduled to hit that day. Scattered throughout this week will be policy decisions from the Fed and ECB, as well as reports on consumer inflation and retail sales for November.In the meantime, it's been tough for the market to gain any traction amid the losses in Apple (AAPL 265.26, -5.44, -2.0%) and the S&P 500 health care sector (-0.5%). Conversely, the S&P 500 communication services (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) sectors have provided some support.M&A activity seen some huge premiums, especially in the biotech space. ArQule (ARQL 19.70, +10.04, +103.4%) will be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for about $2.7 billion.

The Nasdaq is also down 0.1%, and the Dow is down 0.2%.Shares of Macy's (M 15.47, +0.32, +2.2%) have shaken off the downgrade at Goldman Sachs this morning amid heavy volume. Possible factors include short-covering activity and a view that the stock's 49% loss in 2019 is a good bargain.Elsewhere, Qorvo (QRVO 109.40, +2.78, +2.6%) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 103.86, +2.53, +2.5%) were both upgraded to Buy from Underperform at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 declined 0.3%.The lack of conviction was understandable considering that there was no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs, which would presumably upset the market if they went into effect without a Phase One deal. There is still some time left this week to strike a deal, but the trade uncertainty helped keep risk sentiment in check.Losses were made most prevalent in the S&P 500 health care (-0.7%), utilities (-0.5%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors. The latter was pressured by Apple (AAPL 266.92, -3.79, -1.4%), which pulled back from record territory.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

CRU: China Plans to Come from Behind to Win the Global Battery Recycling Industry, Thanks to New PoliciesPR NewswireDecember 2, 2019 Monday 4:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 523 wordsDateline: LONDON, Dec. 2, 2019 BodyPR NewswireLithium-ion battery (LIB) recycling is hardly new in the developed world, with notable industry players and well-established regulations in place to process the countless 3-cell batteries reaching the scrap-heap each day from portable electronics.However, the lack of explicit regulations (EU excluded) and integral recycling networks for the nascent secondary market of electric vehicle (xEV) batteries means that the playing field has once again been levelled; and China is positioning itself to capitalize on the opportunity.Are proper regulations in place in China?China is the world's largest consumer of xEVs, representing 30% of global sales in 2018, and this share is expected to double by 2030. In a previous Insight, CRU showed that a vast quantity of used LIB will enter the scrap pool during this timeframe, causing severe pollution if not treated properly. Against this backdrop, the Chinese government has begun to implement a series of regulations aimed at promoting construction of an end-of-life vehicle (ELV) battery recycling industry that is environmentally-friendly, resource-saving and economically-beneficial.The first regulation mentioning ELV battery recycling was issued by the General Office of the State Council in 2012. The regulation requires the construction of a recycling system, clarifies the rights, roles and responsibilities of each party, and provides guidance on recycling and second-life options. More explicit and detailed regulations were issued in the following years, providing further detail and clarity on responsibilities. They also intended to show: how to trace xEV batteries through their life cycle; how to establish an efficient recycling system; and how to maximize utilization of the residual value of ELV batteries.Read the full story:https://www.crugroup.com/knowledge-and-insights/insights/2019/china-plans-to-come-from-behind-to-win-the-global-battery-recycling-industry-thanks-to-new-policies/ Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRUAbout CRUCRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation by Robert Perlman in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.CRU employs over 280 experts and has more than 11 offices around the world, in Europe, the Americas, China, Asia and Australia - our office in Beijing opened in 2004 and Singapore in 2018.When facing critical business decisions, you can rely on our first-hand knowledge to give you a complete view of a commodity market.

A trade war ceasefire is just what America's economy needsCNN.comDecember 13, 2019 Friday 3:51 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: PERSPECTIVESLength: 746 wordsByline: By Mary E. Lovely for CNN Business PerspectivesBodyThe US Trade Representative's announcement of a "Phase One" trade deal between the United States and China is good news for the American economy.The Chinese have agreed to purchase US agricultural products, energy and manufactured goods and made commitments on intellectual property protection and currency management.In exchange, President Trump agreed to reduce tariffs levied in September, including those on imports of apparel and accessories, as well as cancel new tariffs that were set to take effect on December 15th. He retained the 25% tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports first imposed in 2018.If Trump hadn't agreed to cancel the December 15th round of tariffs, the average US tariff rate on Chinese exports would have climbed to almost 24% -- dramatically higher than the average tariff of 3.1% in place before the trade conflict began in July 2018.An agreement will not only avoid the levy of new taxes on US imports of cell phones, laptops and toys -- products largely engineered, designed and marketed in the US -- it will also preempt new Chinese retaliatory duties, including the re-imposition of tariffs on US autos and auto parts.The December round of tariffs would have harmed American interests with very little impact on the Chinese economy. Of the estimated $160 billion of imports scheduled to be taxed on December 15, 60% would have been computers and other electronic devices, mostly cell phones and laptops. Most of these devices are assembled in foreign-owned factories operating in China like the Foxconn facilities that assemble Apple's iPhones. The upshot is that these tariffs would fall mostly on American technology companies and their suppliers, with little impact on Chinese producers suspected of unfair subsidies or technology theft. Certainly, lower sales for these foreign producers could cause layoffs of Chinese factory workers, but the tariffs would do little harm to key players behind China's drive for technological innovation.New tariffs are not only ineffective, they are costly for America. The continuing strength of the overall US economy belies the trouble brewing in America's manufacturing sector, much of it caused by the trade war. Early US tariffs fell largely on intermediate inputs -- the parts and supplies American manufacturers use to feed domestic production. For some of these products, suppliers don't exist outside of China. With tariff rates on these goods now at 25%, American factories are feeling the pinch. Compounding the pain is a general slowdown in the global economy, increasing the difficulty US companies face in maintaining and expanding export sales.America's factory activity has contracted in each of the past four months. Respondents to the influential Institute for Supply Management's Business Survey cite ongoing economic uncertainty and confusion over the US-China trade relations as reasons for the slowdown. And despite compensatory payments of $23 billion over the past two years, American farm states continue to suffer from the trade war.A ceasefire in the trade war will bring much needed relief to America's factories and farms. Because renewed agricultural purchases by China have been declared a "must-have" by American negotiators, a "Phase One" deal will begin the process of restoring health to American farmlands.

TikTok Faces U.S. National Security ProbeStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 4, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 605 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyQueried by AFP, TikTok said it could not comment on any regulatory matter but noted that it "has made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the United States".Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) last month sent a letter to Treasury requesting a CFIUS review of the national-security implications of the Musical.ly deal, saying there is "ample and growing evidence" that TikTok is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese government. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently called for the USA government to accelerate plans to establish rules on exports of critical technologies to China while expressing a "deep concern" at the current rate of the regulatory rollout.After acquiring Musical.ly, Beijing-based ByteDance merged it into TikTok. CFIUS, based out of the Treasury Department, comprises members from a dozen different agencies who review transactions in which an worldwide business acquires a U.S. business for national security concerns. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) later in October asked for the USA intelligence community to assess national-security risks of TikTok and other Chinese-owned content platforms in the U.S. They said that while TikTok says it stores United States user data in the USA, the company must still adhere to Chinese law on supplying information to the government.The sources told Reuters that CFIUS is in talks with TikTok about measures it could take to avoid divesting the Musical.ly assets it acquired. The spokesperson said he or she can't comment on ongoing regulatory processes. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) sent a letter last week to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire asking for a national security probe, saying they were concerned about the app's collection of user data, and whether China censors the content U.S. users can see. The company has said U.S. user data is stored in the United States, but the senators noted that ByteDance is governed by Chinese laws. He previously reported to Zhang Nan, the head of ByteDance's Douyin, a Chinese short video app. Some of the concerns mentioned by the Senators included the possibility that China is censoring images meant for US viewers, and whether the app could be targeted by foreign countries looking to influence American users.The specifics of the US federal investigation remain unclear, though it's likely to cover why the company didn't secure clearance from the CFIUS for this purchase per Reuters.World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg opts out of $100-million contractWashington is expected to make a push to re-sign Strasburg at a value larger than the four-year, $100 million figure he declined. The three-time All-Star is 112-58 with a 3.17 ERA and 1,695 strikeouts in 239 starts with the Nationals since 2010.In an October 9 letter to Mnuchin, U.S. Sen.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose product competes with TikTok particularly for younger users, has also criticized the app over censorship concerns.Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd said in May [2019] it would seek to sell its popular gay dating app Grindr after CFIUS approached it with national security concerns. The committee made nationwide headlines for blocking the sale of US-based money-transfer company MoneyGram to China's Ant Financial in early 2018. Such accusations have also been leveled against other Chinese companies, including Huawei.ByteDance counts Japanese technology giant SoftBank, venture firm Sequoia Capital and big private-equity firms such as KKR, General Atlantic and Hillhouse Capital Group as backers.Load-Date: November 4, 2019End of Document

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 million (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC ("Mattress PAL"), and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division ("Bankruptcy Court") seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The Company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the Company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the Company's global net sales in 2019, and the Company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the Company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers. Antero Resources also announced commencement of an asset sale program targeting $750 million to $1 billion in proceeds to be completed in 2020. The asset sale program was initiated with a $100 million sale of AM shares to Antero Midstream. The amendment to the gathering agreement and the share repurchase with Antero Midstream were negotiated and recommended by the Conflicts Committees of Antero Midstream and Antero Resources and approved by both Boards of Directors.07:32AM Antero Midstream to repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources (AR) (4.49 )In addition, Antero Midstream and Antero Resources have agreed to a growth incentive fee program where Antero Midstream will provide a reduction in low pressure gathering fees for volumes gathered from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2023 subject to achieving increasing volumetric targets. The growth incentive fee program aligns with Antero Resources' current 8% to 10% compound annual net production growth plan in 2020 and 2021. The share repurchase and growth incentive fee reduction transactions have been negotiated and recommended by the Conflicts Committees of Antero Midstream and Antero Resources and approved by both Boards of Directors.Due to additional optimization of the midstream infrastructure buildout, Antero Midstream is now targeting a 2020 capital program of approximately $300 to $325 million. This represents a $75 to $100 million, or 22% reduction, compared to the previous target of $375 to $425 million.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73 percent of patients received corticosteroids and 76 percent received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade =3 CRS (2 percent) and neurologic events (17 percent), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13 percent CRS, 31 percent neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73 percent in Cohort 4, with 51 percent of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )Co announces that the Company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve patient outcomes.

All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit.In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8thPre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; No dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time-a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemiaIn an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents 'encouraging' preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells (CFC's) was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial,1 evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75 percent of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72 percent of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01 percent) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75 percent of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72 percent (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57 percent after 6 cycles, 68 percent after 9 cycles, and 73 percent after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93 percent of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2 percent) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p < 0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p < 0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p < 0.001), reduction in pain (p < 0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p < 0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p < 0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p < 0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

Ninety-four percent of patients were refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody and 84% percent were triple refractory (refractory to an IMiD agent, PI and anti-CD38 antibody). Results for the primary endpoint (overall response rate [ORR]) and key secondary endpoint (complete response rate [CR]), as well as duration of response (DoR) and progression-free survival (PFS) across the target dose levels and at each of the three target doses explored in the study are presented in the table below. The median follow-up duration for all subjects was 11.3 months.Overall, the safety results were consistent with those observed in the phase 1 CRB-401 study, which evaluated the preliminary safety and efficacy of ide-cel. Instances of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 5.5% (7/128) of patients, including one fatal CRS event. Investigator identified grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity events (iiNT) occurred in 3.1% (4/128) of patients and there were no Grade 4 iiNT events reported. Grade 3 or higher CRS and iiNT events were reported in <6% of subjects at each target dose. CRS of any grade occurred in 83.6% (107/128) of patients and iiNT of any grade occurred in 18% (23/128) of patients.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -7.50.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value following a quiet weekend in news, muted sessions in Asia and Europe, and a dearth of earnings reports today. The benchmark index enters this week less than nine points from its all-time high.With no economic reports set to be released today, either, the market will remain focused on any U.S.-China trade progress ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs. Central bank meetings have also crept into the market's radar, although no change is policy is expected from either the Fed on Wednesday or the ECB on Thursday.In the health care space, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.10, +1.15, +1.9%) has pleased investors with data for a cancer treatment while ArQule (ARQL 19.53, +9.87, +102.3%) has agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for $20 per share or about $2.7 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed this morning.

This was comparable to historical data with multiple doses of busulfan conditioning.CD117-ADC was well tolerated in non-human primates with no evidence of the often severe side effects seen with busulfan conditioning, including veno-occlusive disease, weight loss, diarrhea, mucositis, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis or seizures.07:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l determines that it will record a charge of $30 mln (before tax) in Q4 in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers (85.89 )On December 6, 2019, Tempur Sealy determined that it will record a charge of $30 million (before tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the bankruptcy of one of its customers, Mattress PAL Holding, LLC ("Mattress PAL"), and the resulting significant liquidity issues of Mattress PAL's affiliates (collectively, "Mattress1One"). On April 7, 2019, Mattress PAL filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division ("Bankruptcy Court") seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11 Proceedings"). On December 5, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court orally granted Mattress PAL's request to convert the Chapter 11 Proceedings to a Chapter 7 liquidation case. The Company plans to treat this charge, which does not involve any cash payments, as an adjustment in calculating adjusted EBITDA under the Company's senior secured credit agreement. Mattress1One represented less than 1% of the Company's global net sales in 2019, and the Company does not expect this charge, or the loss of Mattress1One as a customer, to have a material impact on the Company's 2019 guidance, 2020 outlook, or current or future liquidity.07:37IEP Icahn Enterprises commences private placement of Senior Notes due 2027 (61.61 )The proceeds from the offering will be used for general limited partnership purposes.07:35MBIO Mustang Bio highlights presentation of updated Phase 1/2 clinical data for MB-107 lentiviral gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (3.85 )Lentiviral Gene Therapy with Low Dose Busulfan for Infants with X-SCID Results in the Development of a Functional Normal Immune System: Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase I/II Clinical Study Lentiviral gene therapy using low dose busulfan conditioning has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events other than hematologic related to busulfanAll 11 patients had robust hematopoietic recovery within 3-4 weeks post cell infusion without blood product support Nine patients, with a follow up of greater than 3 months, achieved normal-for-age T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell numbers within 3-4 months post gene therapy Five patients are off intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy thus far, of whom 3 responded to vaccines Median vector copy number (VCN) at 12 months post-gene therapy in seven patients, who have been followed for more than 12 months, was 2.25 VCN/cell (range: 1.24-3.03) in T cells, 0.34 VCN/cell (range: 0.23-1.25) in B cells, 1.55 VCN/cell (range 1.27-3.39) in NK cells, and 0.08 VCN/cell (range: 0.03-0.76) in myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and 0.10 (range: 0.05-0.66) in CD34+ bone marrow cells, respectivelyEnhanced Transduction Lentivector Gene Therapy for Treatment of Older Patients with X-Linked Severe Combined ImmunodeficiencyEarly outcome data for five older children and young adults with XSCID who received the lentivector (also known as lentiviral) gene therapy as salvage therapy after having previously received haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as infants without chemotherapy-based conditioning were previously reported and published in Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, three additional patients were treated, and the cohort of eight patients (referred to as Cohort A) has now been followed for 3 to 7 years. Among Cohort A, gradual clinical benefit in the clearance of chronic norovirus and associated improved abdominal complaints, malabsorption, growth and IgG production were observed, and four patients were able to cease immunoglobulin replacement therapy.While the results were positive, the relatively inefficient transduction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) required large quantities of vector. This resulted in relatively low VCN in myeloid cells in some patients, with delayed immune cell recovery and persistent clinical disease, especially in the last patient treated (patient 8). To address this, NIH developed a refined enhanced transduction (ET) procedure consisting of a single overnight transduction after 48 hours pre-stimulation in cytokines (Stem cell factor, Thrombopoietin, Flt3-ligand; 100ng/mL) and incorporated transduction enhancers LentiBoost 1:100 and dimethyl prostaglandin 2 (dmPGE2; 1uM).The presentation at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting included data from six patients (referred to as Cohort B) treated by NIH, including re-treatment of patient 8. The patients, who were aged 12 to 36, had significant problems with donor T cell infiltration of liver, bone marrow and kidneys, and were nearly absent of B and NK cells. The enhanced transduction procedure achieved much greater transduction efficiencies than were observed in Cohort A, with greater than 10-fold less vector, and resulted in faster immune reconstitution and more significant clinical benefit by 3 months.07:33AR Antero Resources highlights agreements expected to reduce its gathering, processing and transportation costs by approximately $350 mln over the next four years, commences asset sale program targeting $750 mln to $1 bln in proceeds to be completed in 2020 (2.19 )The agreements include a growth incentive fee program with Antero Midstream Corporation (AM) that aligns with the Company's current 8% to 10% compound annual production growth plan through 2021 and additional agreements with other third party midstream providers. Antero Resources also announced commencement of an asset sale program targeting $750 million to $1 billion in proceeds to be completed in 2020. The asset sale program was initiated with a $100 million sale of AM shares to Antero Midstream. The amendment to the gathering agreement and the share repurchase with Antero Midstream were negotiated and recommended by the Conflicts Committees of Antero Midstream and Antero Resources and approved by both Boards of Directors.07:32AM Antero Midstream to repurchase $100 mln of shares from Antero Resources (AR) (4.49 )In addition, Antero Midstream and Antero Resources have agreed to a growth incentive fee program where Antero Midstream will provide a reduction in low pressure gathering fees for volumes gathered from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2023 subject to achieving increasing volumetric targets. The growth incentive fee program aligns with Antero Resources' current 8% to 10% compound annual net production growth plan in 2020 and 2021. The share repurchase and growth incentive fee reduction transactions have been negotiated and recommended by the Conflicts Committees of Antero Midstream and Antero Resources and approved by both Boards of Directors.Due to additional optimization of the midstream infrastructure buildout, Antero Midstream is now targeting a 2020 capital program of approximately $300 to $325 million. This represents a $75 to $100 million, or 22% reduction, compared to the previous target of $375 to $425 million. Antero Resources' previously announced preliminary 2020 target of 110 to 120 completions in 2020, with an average lateral length of 12,100 feet is unchanged. Both Antero Resources and Antero Midstream expect to finalize their respective capital budgets early in the first quarter of 2020 following Board approval. Formal guidance is expected to be released following Board approval.07:30SESN Sesen Bio initiated the submission of its BLA for Vicinium for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer under Rolling Review to the FDA (1.18 )The Company has submitted completed non-clinical and clinical modules, and a partially completed Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) module.

Additionally, two patients (8%) achieved stable disease. In untreated AML, the ORR was 64%, with nine patients (41%) achieving a CR, three patients (14%) achieving a CR with complete blood count recovery (CRi) and one patient (5%) achieving a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). Additionally, seven patients (32%) achieved stable disease (SD) and one patient (5%) had progressive disease. The median time to response among MDS and AML patients treated with the combination was 1.9 months. No median duration of response or overall survival has been reached for either MDS or AML patients, with a median follow-up of 6.4 months (range 2.0 to 14.4 months) for MDS and 8.8 months (range 1.9 to 16.9 months) for AML.Clinical Development Plans for Magrolimab in MDS and AMLForty Seven achieved alignment with the FDA on the final design of its potentially registration-enabling clinical development program for magrolimab in higher-risk MDS. Based on recent interactions under its Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), Forty Seven now plans to continue enrolling patients in its ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial with an amended protocol, and to initiate a Phase 3 randomized control trial (RCT), ENHANCE, to evaluate the combination of magrolimab and azacitidine compared to azacitidine alone. This approach provides two distinct opportunities to achieve an accelerated approval, with a potential BLA filing expected in the fourth quarter of 2021.07:02DTIL Precision BioSciences announces updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of its lead investigational off-the-shelf (allogeneic) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy candidate, PBCAR0191 (19.66 )Key baseline characteristics were as follows:Dose Level 1 (3x105 cells/kg) -- three NHL patients (two with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, one with mantle cell lymphoma) with a mean age of 54 years (min-max 34-64 years).

The primary efficacy endpoint in the trial was change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 16 weeks compared to sham. The 6g dose showed a difference of +2.6 letters versus sham, which was not statistically significant (p=0.223), and the 3g dose showed a difference of +1.5 letters (p=0.465). No significant differences were observed in the secondary endpoints of central subfield thickness (CST) or the diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS). KVD001 was generally safe and well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events.07:01RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals announces prelim data from its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RP-L201 for the treatment of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-I (22.36 )Initial results from the first pediatric patient treated with RP-L201 demonstrate early evidence of safety and potential efficacy. Analyses of peripheral vector copy number (VCN) and CD18-expressing neutrophils were performed through three months after infusion of RP-L201 to evaluate engraftment and phenotypic correction. The patient exhibited early signs of engraftment with myeloid-lineage VCN levels of 1.5 at three months and CD18 expression of 45%, compared to pre-treatment CD18 expressions of <1%. The patient also displayed visible improvement of multiple disease-related skin lesions after receiving therapy. The drug product VCN was 3.8. No safety or tolerability issues related to RP-L201 administration (or investigational product) have been identified to-date. These data are consistent with Rocket's preclinical studies, which demonstrated that administration of RP-L201 in murine models resulted in stable engraftment and phenotypic correction with restored neutrophil migration capability.07:00SUMRX Asian Markets Close: Nikkei +0.3%, Hang Seng UNCH, Shanghai +0.1%Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region began the week on a modestly higher, but quiet note.

All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with OPDIVO. Median duration of response was not yet reached and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95% CI: 7.06, -). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia. Fifty-seven percent of patients (12/21) had at least one treatment-related adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3, most commonly increase in lipase (24 percent, 5/21), peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (each 14 percent, 3/21), and fatigue and hyponatremia (each 10 percent, 2/21). Two-Year Follow-up Results from the Phase 1-2 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination with Nivolumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Abstract #238, oral presentation at 2:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, December 7, 2019) Of the 91 treated patients, 85 percent (77/91) had an objective response, including 67 percent (61/91) with a complete response, 16 patients with a partial response and six patients had stable disease. Of the 91 treated patients, 67 patients received an ASCT per trial protocol with no additional salvage therapy. For all treated patients, the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 79 percent (95% CI: 68%, 87%). For the 67 patients who received an ASCT per trial protocol, the two-year PFS was 92 percent (95% CI: 80%, 97%). Median follow-up for all treated patients was 24.2 months (range 1.8-41.7) and the median PFS was not reached. Estimated overall survival at two years was 94 percent (95% CI: 85%, 97%) and median overall survival was not yet reached. Peripheral immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Prior to ASCT, the most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 20 percent of patients were nausea, infusion related reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, vomiting and pyrexia. Other adverse events included peripheral neuropathy in 16 patients (18 percent) and neutropenia in six patients (7 percent). Two patients (2 percent) discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (15 percent), including pneumonia, pneumonitis and pyrexia (two patients each); and Grade 3 Guillain-Barre syndrome (one patient).06:52GILD Gilead Sciences reports Long-term data from ZUMA-1 demonstrating about half of refractory large b-cell lymphoma patients were alive three years after Yescarta treatment (67.08 )Co announced new data from the ZUMA-1 trial of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These results included updated overall survival data from the pivotal phase 2 study after three years following a single infusion of Yescarta, as well as an analysis from a separate safety management cohort of patients receiving early steroid intervention for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events. Updated results from a separate ZUMA-1 safety management study (Cohort 4) were also presented at the meeting (Abstract #243). In this analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with Yescarta received earlier steroid intervention, beginning when patients experienced Grade 1 neurologic events or experienced Grade 1 CRS with no improvement after three days of supportive care. Patients could receive optional bridging chemotherapy prior to Yescarta infusion. In the analysis, 41 patients had received Yescarta, with a median follow-up of 8.7 months; 73 percent of patients received corticosteroids and 76 percent received tocilizumab. Earlier steroid use appeared to decrease the percentage of patients with Grade =3 CRS (2 percent) and neurologic events (17 percent), each of which were numerically lower than rates in the registrational cohorts of ZUMA-1 (13 percent CRS, 31 percent neurologic events). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS or neurologic events and no Grade 5 AEs related to Yescarta in Cohort 4. Objective response rate per investigator assessment was 73 percent in Cohort 4, with 51 percent of patients achieving a complete response. The median duration of response was 8.9 months. Fifty-four percent of patients in this cohort remained in an ongoing response with at least six months of follow-up after Yescarta infusion. Median OS in Cohort 4 has not been reached.06:51CRTX Cortexyme reports new data revealing link between bacterial pathogen and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (28.31 )Co announced the presentation of new data supporting the on-target activity of COR388, its lead investigational medicine, and linking the "gingipain hypothesis" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the significance of the APOE gene as a major risk factor for the disease.Gingipains from P. gingivalis cleave ApoE proteins and have a preference for cleaving ApoE4; and COR388, a gingipain inhibitor, prevents this. In in vitro experiments, cells infected with P. gingivalis exhibited gingipain-dependent ApoE cleavage activity that generated ApoE fragments similar to what was seen in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, uninfected cells had no significant ApoE protein-cleaving activity. Furthermore, P. gingivalis gingipains cleaved ApoE4 more readily than ApoE3. Finally, in the infected cells, COR388 alone was sufficient to block ApoE fragmentation. In a Phase 1b trial, COR388 reduced ApoE fragments in CSF. Cortexyme's Phase 1 clinical development program for COR388 included cohorts of healthy volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to assessing safety and initial clinical activity, investigators also assessed the level of ApoE fragmentation in the CSF of nine subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Six subjects received 50mg of COR388 twice daily while three subjects received placebo. After 28 days, a statistically significant decrease in ApoE fragments (both ApoE4 and ApoE3) was observed in subjects treated with COR388 versus those treated with placebo.06:51EGRX Eagle Pharma commences dosing in pilot study for novel estrogen receptor antagonist product candidate (56.43 )Co announces that the Company has commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of its fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptor ("ER") inhibition and improve patient outcomes. The results of the pilot study will inform the design of the Company's pivotal trial, which Eagle expects to commence in 2020.06:51BLUE Bluebirdbio presents new data from ongoing Phase 1/2 HGB-206 study of investigational LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease (79.42 )HGB-206 is an ongoing, Phase 1/2 open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin gene therapy for SCD that includes three treatment cohorts: Groups A, B and C. All results are as of the data cutoff date of August 26, 2019.Groups A and B:As of the data cutoff date, seven out of nine total patients in Groups A and B (five out of seven in Group A and two out of two in Group B) did not require regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. Overall, patients in Groups A and B experienced a reduction, but not complete elimination of VOC and ACS events at two years post-treatment, suggesting that the levels of gene therapy-derived hemoglobin may have been sufficient to reduce but not eliminate continued sickle-related disease manifestations. Group C As of the data cutoff date, 17 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD in Group C, with the longest follow-up at 21 months; none required regular RBC transfusions post-treatment. In patients with six or more months of follow-up (n=12), median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were at least 40% of total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q levels ranged from 9.3 -- 15.2 g/dL and 2.7 -- 9.0 g/dL, respectively, at last visit. Treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD reduced key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and total bilirubin concentration, which suggests that treatment is improving biological markers of the disease. Among the nine patients with at least six months of follow-up who had four or more VOC or ACS events in the two years prior to treatment, there was a 99% reduction in annualized rate of VOC and ACS. There were no reports of ACS or serious VOC at up to 21 months post-treatment in these patients. As previously reported, there was one non-serious Grade 2 VOC was observed in a patient approximately 3.5 months post-LentiGlobin for SCD treatment.HGB-206 Exploratory Assays bluebird bio presented results from exploratory assays in samples from a subset of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD from Groups A, B and C, to assess the relationship between drug product characteristics and RBC physiology. To demonstrate the pancellular expression of the gene therapy derived anti-sickling Hb, HbAT87Q, bluebird bio developed an assay that enables detection of HbAT87Q and HbS protein in individual RBCs. In 12 patients who had at least six months of follow-up, the proportion of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q at the last study visit was more than 70% in all cases; with more than 90% of RBCs positive for HbAT87Q in four patients.On average, HbAT87Q present in RBCs of patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was within the range of non-sickling adult Hb, HbA, present in the RBCs from people with sickle cell trait. The RBCs also resembled sickle cell trait RBCs with regard to propensity to sickle under low oxygen conditions. Sickling of RBCs from patients treated with LentiGlobin for SCD was significantly less than that seen in untreated patients with SCD.06:49MNK Mallinckrodt plc presents data on a novel predictive model to identify infants at risk for infantile spasms (3.41 )Co announced findings on the use of a novel predictive model designed to more quickly identify infants with infantile spasms (IS), a rare seizure disorder that typically occurs between three and seven months of age. Key FindingsDeductive models developed to identify the combinations of variables that predict IS prior to diagnosis and during the treatment pathway: 557 patients had =2 symptoms pertaining to IS -- seizures, developmental delay, lack of eye contact and lack of muscle tone -- and a moderate or high severity ED visit.In this group, 55 percent of patients (n=304) had an IS diagnosis within a median 0.8 months of the triggering event. The most notable deductive combinations focused on pre-diagnosis of IS. MethodsThe study utilized data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse database to identify triggers for early identification of IS patients from medical and pharmacy claims from 10.8 million patients under 2 years of age between May 2017 and April 2018. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes were evaluated to identify the codes most likely to predict a subsequent diagnosis of IS. Researchers also used input from IS medical experts to determine the clinical, electrographic, radiologic, procedural and medication variables that may predict IS development.06:48SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics announces preliminary results from first three patients treated in Phase 1/2 THALES study evaluating investigational ST-400 ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (11.66 )The three patients treated with ST-400 experienced prompt hematopoietic reconstitution, demonstrating neutrophil engraftment in 14-22 days and platelet engraftment in 22-35 days (Table 1). No emerging clonal hematopoiesis has to date been observed by on-target indel pattern monitoring in the three treated patients. Reported adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the known toxicities of mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative busulfan conditioning. One serious adverse event (SAE) related to ST-400 was reported. As previously disclosed, Patient 1 experienced hypersensitivity during ST-400 infusion considered by the investigator to be likely related to the product cryoprotectant excipient, DMSO, and which resolved by the end of the infusion.06:47LITE Lumentum to offer $850 mln aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (72.08 )Lumentum intends to use approximately $196 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, and a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to purchase up to approximately $200 million of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of this offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through the initial purchaser of the notes or its affiliates as its agent.

Patients who completed treatment with the VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO combination also achieved higher rates of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity and complete remissions compared to those treated with a standard of care, bendamustine plus rituximab (BR).06:41EPZM Epizyme reports updated Phase 2 data for Tazemetostat; on track for NDA submission this month (18.22 )The data show that treatment with tazemetostat demonstrated meaningful clinical activity as assessed by both investigators and an Independent Review Committee (IRC), and was generally well tolerated in both FL patients with EZH2 activating mutations (n=45) and FL patients with wild-type EZH2 (n=54). The IRC assessment was conducted for inclusion in Epizyme's planned NDA submission to the FDA in December 2019. As assessed by the IRC, as of an August 9, 2019 data cutoff date, tazemetostat treatment resulted in: Objective response rate (ORR) of 69% for patients with an EZH2 mutation and 35% for patients with wild-type EZH2 Median duration of response of 11 months for patients with an EZH2 mutation and 13 months for patients with wild-type EZH2 Median progression-free survival of 14 months for patients with an EZH2 mutation and 11 months for patients with wild-type EZH2 Overall survival has not yet been reached for either FL patient population.06:40KPTI Karyopharm Therapeutics presents four posters relating to XPOVIO at ASH (16.29 )The four posters include: updated data from the Kyprolis (carfilzomib) arm of the Phase 1b/2 STOMP study evaluating selinexor in combination with backbone therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma; new data from the Revlimid (lenalidomide) plus selinexor arm of the STOMP study evaluating this combination in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma; encore data highlighting the previously disclosed comparison of patients in the STORM study, Karyopharm's Phase 2b study evaluating XPOVIO in patients with heavily pretreated, triple class refractory multiple myeloma, to matched patients from the MAMMOTH study; and new Phase 1/2 data evaluating eltanexor in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)."Efficacy data from our ongoing STOMP study investigating selinexor in combination with standard of care anti-myeloma agents continue to demonstrate a strong rationale for selinexor's potential expanded role in the future multiple myeloma treatment paradigm," said Sharon Shacham, PhD, MBA, Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Karyopharm. "The Kyprolis arm of the STOMP study continues to show clear signs of clinical activity, including a complete response rate of 21%, in patients with heavily pretreated Kyprolis-nave multiple myeloma. Additionally, preliminary data from the Revlimid arm of the Phase 1b/2 STOMP study show early but encouraging clinical activity, including in one patient who achieved a complete response, in patients with multiple myeloma in the front-line setting. And finally, we are pleased to be presenting new data from the eltanexor program showing impressive early activity, including a high rate of complete responses in elderly patients with higher-risk MDS."06:39IPHA Innate Pharma presents new, long-term data from pivotal Phase III trial of Lumoxiti; data expands on efficacy results and affirms manageable safety profile (6.20 )The final analysis showed that 36 percent (29/80) of the relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia patients achieved durable complete response (CR) with Lumoxiti at Day 181 of patients' respective evaluation, compared to the primary analysis in which 30 percent durable CR rate was reported. In addition, there was a 61 percent probability that patients who achieved a CR would maintain it after five years.06:38AGIO Agios Pharma announces that clinical proof-of-concept has been established based on preliminary analysis of Phase 2 trial of mitapivat in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (40.94 )The Phase 2 study has enrolled 12 of the intended 17 patients (nine with -thalassemia and three with a-thalassemia). As of the November 14, 2019 data cutoff date, eight patients, all with -thalassemia, were evaluable for the primary endpoint of a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL from baseline in at least one assessment during Weeks 4-12. All eight patients were treated with 50 mg of mitapivat twice daily for the first six weeks and escalated to 100 mg twice daily, and all patients remain on treatment (range 12.4-34.3 weeks). Seven of eight efficacy evaluable patients achieved a hemoglobin increase of =1.0 g/dL, and for responders the mean hemoglobin increase from baseline was 1.76 g/dL (range, 0.9--3.3 g/dL) during Weeks 4-12. The majority of adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 and consistent with previously published Phase 2 data for mitapivat in patients with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Updated results from the Phase 2 thalassemia study will be presented at a medical meeting in the first half of 2020.06:38PRNB Principia Biopharma reports positive data of PRN1008 for Immune Thrombocytopenia in ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial (37.39 )Co announced consistent positive data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of its investigational treatment, PRN1008, in 31 highly treatment-resistant and refractory patients (median of six prior therapies) with immune thrombocytopenia.Of the 31 patients, 39 percent (80 percent confidence interval (CI) 28, 50), irrespective of dose and duration of treatment, achieved the trial's primary endpoint of =2 consecutive platelet counts of =50,000/L, separated by at least five days, and increased by =20,000/L from baseline, without requiring rescue medication. In addition, 45 percent (80 percent CI 34, 57) of enrolled patients achieved any two platelet counts =50,000/L. Most patients who achieved the primary endpoint had a platelet count >30,000/L by the first week of treatment. Preliminary data on 13 patients treated at higher doses (300mg and 400mg twice daily) and who had completed at least 12 weeks of therapy, demonstrated a response rate of 54 percent (80 percent CI 37, 70) and 62 percent (80 percent CI 44, 77) for both endpoints respectively. To date PRN1008 has been well-tolerated at all doses studied, whether given as a monotherapy or with allowed concomitant ITP therapy (thrombopoietin and steroids), with no reported treatment related bleeding or thrombotic events.

The results from the pharmacokinetic and occupancy studies for the first seven patients have been in-line with expectations. The Company anticipates that a dose that achieves maximum target occupancy will be achieved in the next one or two dose cohorts. CPI-818 has been shown to bind covalently to ITK at low nanomolar concentrations without reacting with other kinases. In vitro studies demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to Sezary cells (malignant cells from patients with CTCL), while sparing normal T-cells, in three subjects not enrolled in the study. Preclinical murine models of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease showed CPI-818 inhibited the development of lymph node and spleen enlargement by preventing proliferation of abnormal T-cells. Treatment with CPI-818 led to regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in animals with established disease.06:32CGC Canopy Growth names David Klein CEO effective January 14 (18.65 )In his current role as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Constellation Brands, David oversees all aspects of the company's finance operations, all mergers and acquisitions, as well as the company's information technology function.The appointment of David Klein follows a thorough recruitment process overseen by a special Hiring Committee of the Board using global recruitment company Heidrick & Struggles, which saw a wide variety of exceptional candidates vetted and interviewed.

Fourteen patients were evaluable at one month.AUTO3 was well-tolerated, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with primary infusion and 1 of 14 experiencing Grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved swiftly with steroids. There were no pembrolizumab immune-related toxicities and the majority of grade 3 or higher adverse events were hematological. Low levels of serum cytokines are consistent with the observed low levels of CRS and neurotoxicity. Across all tested doses 5 patients achieved a complete response, with 4 of 5 complete responses ongoing, the longest at 18 months. All CRs were achieved without need for steroid or tocilizumab-based management of the patients or ICU level care.AUTO3 -- (Poster) - Phase 1/2 AMELIA clinical trial of AUTO3 in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) (Abstract # 2620)AUTO3 was well-tolerated overall, with no patients experiencing = Grade 3 CRS and no patients experiencing = Grade 2 neurotoxicity, in doses =3x106 /kg CAR-T cells. No AUTO3-related deaths were reported.Among the 10 CAR T-nave patients, at a median follow-up time of 9.7 months (range 1.8- 18), 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a complete response, and 8 of 10 (80%) achieved complete molecular remission by PCR. Estimated overall survival at 12 months was 100%. There are 2 ongoing patients in complete molecular remission at 12 and 15 months post-AUTO3 infusion, respectively. The most common cause of relapse was due to loss of CAR T-cell persistence. The median persistence of CAR-T cells in blood was 170 days.06:29STOK Stoke Therapeutics presents new preclinical data on STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (28.98 )Data from studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed STK-001 distributed throughout the brain and achieved target engagement and increased Nav1.1 protein expression throughout the cortex after a single intrathecal injection. Safety findings showed STK-001 to be well-tolerated at the two intrathecal dose levels studied. These data were presented in a poster session at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore.Stoke plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and, subject to acceptance of the IND, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 single-ascending dose study in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the first half of 2020.06:28FATE Fate Therapeutics presents new in vivo preclinical data for FT596 -- company plans to initiate enrollment of first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in rarly 2020 (13.67 )FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. In addition to a proprietary CAR targeting CD19, FT596 expresses a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling coincident targeting of CD19 and additional tumor-associated antigens such as CD20. FT596 also expresses an interleukin-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells without the need for systemic cytokine support. Together, these features of FT596 are intended to maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of a first-in-human clinical trial of FT596 in early 2020.New preclinical data presented at ASH showed that FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells in a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma. Additionally, when combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, FT596 showed enhanced killing of CD20+ lymphoma cells in vivo as compared to rituximab alone. These data confirm previously presented in vitro findings that demonstrate the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate's potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.The Company also announced that, in preparation for Phase 1 initiation, it had recently completed GMP production of FT596. In a single small-scale manufacturing campaign, the Company produced over 300 cryopreserved, infusion-ready doses of FT596 at a cost of approximately $2,500 per dose. The Company's iPSC product platform unites stem cell biology and precision genetic engineering to create renewable master engineered iPSC lines that can be repeatedly used to mass produce cancer-fighting immune cells, replacing the high production costs, weeks of manufacturing time, and complex manufacturing processes required for current-generation CAR T-cell immunotherapies with a lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture, well-characterized, off-the-shelf product that has the potential to reach many more patients.06:27SGMO Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer (PFE) report updated Phase 1/2 results showing sustained increased Factor VIII activity through 44 weeks (11.66 )Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) and Pfizer (PFE) announced updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII (FVIII) levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort.06:27KURA Kura Oncology provides clinical and regulatory updates for lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (15.61 )In June 2019, Kura reported that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in each of the expansion cohorts in its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in relapsed or refractory PTCL: 1) patients with AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression, and 2) patients with PTCL who lack a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Given the high level of activity observed among AITL patients, Kura continued to enroll patients to acquire more experience regarding safety and tolerability in this population. Based upon the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms1, AITL and AITL-like histologies represent approximately one-third of all PTCL cases.As of the November 11, 2019 data cutoff date, a total of 26 patients with relapsed or refractory AITL were enrolled in all stages of the trial. Among the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, five achieved a complete response (CR) and five achieved a partial response (PR), for an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% on an evaluable basis and 38% on an intent-to-treat basis. In addition, three patients experienced disease stabilization. Patients had a median of three prior regimens (range 1-7).Next-generation sequencing of 19 available patient biopsies showed that 10 (53%) carried C336R/Q386E variants in the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL2, an immune checkpoint receptor. Four of the 10 patients with KIR3DL2 variants achieved a CR and three achieved a PR, for a CR rate of 40% and an ORR of 70%. This compares to a CR rate of 11% and an ORR of 22% among the nine AITL patients with KIR3DL2 wild type.Regulatory Update: Following FDA feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, Kura plans to initiate a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL and related lymphomas in 2020. The multi-center, single-arm trial will target enrollment of 128 patients with AITL and AITL-like histologies who are relapsed or refractory to at least one prior systemic cytotoxic therapy.06:26PTLA Portola Pharma presents new interim results from ongoing Phase 2a study of cerdulatinib in patients with specific subtypes of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (29.21 )As of the November 12, 2019 cut-off date, 64 PTCL patients and 40 CTCL patients treated with cerdulatinib as a single agent were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% in the PTCL cohort and 43% in the CTCL cohort. Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with AITL, the ORR was 52% and the complete response rate (CR) was 37%.Among the 64 patients in the PTCL cohort, 14 patients (22%) achieved a CR and eight patients (12%) achieved a partial response (PR). In the subgroup of 27 patients with AITL, 10 patients (37%) achieved a CR, and four patients (15%) achieved a PR. The median duration of response is eight months for all PTCL patients and is greater than nine months in AITL patients. Follow-up is ongoing. Among the 40 patients in the CTCL cohort, three patients (8%) achieved a CR and 14 patients (35%) achieved a PR. Importantly, rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching -- a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL -- have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common Grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5% were lipase increase (25%), amylase increase (19%), neutropenia (12%), anemia (10%), diarrhea (8%), sepsis/bacteremia (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%). The lipase and amylase changes were generally asymptomatic and not associated with pancreatitis.06:25XENE Xenon Pharmaceuticals provides updates on partnered neurology pipeline programs (13.95 )Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that it will provide updates on its partnered epilepsy programs at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting.Overview of clinical stage XEN901 and Related Patient Survey to be Presented in the "Genetic Epilepsies -- Updates in the Science and Diagnosis" on December 8thPre-clinical work suggests selective sodium channel inhibitors that reduce action potential firing in excitatory neurons, while sparing inhibitory interneurons, may provide promising drug profile06:25IMV IMV presents updated results from SPiReL at ASH (2.83 )The poster, which included additional data collected between the abstract submission and the presentation, continued to demonstrate a favorable therapeutic profile and treatment-associated clinical benefit in r/r DLBCL patients who received the DPX-Survivac combination regimen.06:24QURE uniQure presents updated clinical data on three patients treated in ongoing Phase IIb study of etranacogene dezaparvovec; additionally presents up to 4 years of follow-up data on the 10 patients in the Phase I/II trial of AMT-060 (66.05 )At Least One Year of Stable, Therapeutic Levels of FIX Activity in Patients Treated with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec: Featured in a poster presentation at ASH, the 52 weeks of follow-up data show that all three patients have stabilized and sustained FIX activity at therapeutic levels after the one-time administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Mean FIX activity for the three patients at 52 weeks after administration was 41% of normal, with the first patient achieving FIX activity of 50% of normal, the second patient achieving FIX activity of 31% of normal and the third patient achieving FIX activity of 41% of normal. The second and third patients had previously screen-failed and were excluded from another gene therapy study due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to a different AAV vector. Reported FIX activity was measured using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay performed at a central laboratory.At one year after dosing, no patient in the study has reported any bleeding events. All patients have remained free of prophylaxis after receiving etranacogene dezaparvovec. One patient, who had earlier in the study undergone hip surgery due to a pre-existing condition, experienced back pain and treated himself with a single infusion of factor replacement, which was later determined by the patient and the investigator to be unrelated to a bleed. No other FIX infusions were reported by any patient.Stable FIX Expression and Durable Reductions in Bleeding and FIX Consumption for up to 4 Years Following AMT-060 Gene Therapy:In the ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, all 10 patients continue to show long-term clinical benefit, including sustained increases in FIX activity, reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and decreased bleeding frequency. At up to 4 years of follow-up, AMT-060 continues to be well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors since the last reported data.All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg (the dose being studied in the ongoing Phase III HOPE-B study of etranacogene dezaparvovec) continue to be free of routine FIX replacement therapy at 3.5 years after treatment. Based on the six months of data collected during the fourth year of follow-up, the mean annualized bleeding rate was zero compared to an average of 4 bleeds during the year prior to treatment, representing a 100% reduction. During this same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy also declined 100% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity over 3.5 years was 7.5%.06:22FATE Fate Therapeutics reports clinical data from Landmark Phase 1 studies; No dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients (13.67 )Fate Therapeutics announced initial clinical data for its FT516 and FT500 off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell product candidates.No morphologic evidence of leukemia and complete neutrophil recovery observed in first patient treated with FT516 Monotherapy for AML following first dosing cycleNo dose-limiting toxicities or FT500-related SAEs reported in first 12 patients treated with FT500 for advanced solid tumorsFavorable FT500 Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity profile validates novel multi-dose treatment paradigm for off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell products.06:22BMY Bristol-Myers presents data from multiple studies evaluating lisocabtagene maraleucel at ASH (59.95 )These studies included an evaluation of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (TRANSCEND CLL 004); a study in second-line patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients who were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (PILOT); and a separate analysis of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received liso-cel in the outpatient setting across three studies."The results in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL demonstrated a high rate of durable complete responses achieved in heavily pre-treated patients, including patients who have failed ibrutinib and venetoclax. We are encouraged by the potential of liso-cel to treat second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell NHL patients who are not able to undergo a stem cell transplant. Finally, the analysis evaluating liso-cel administered in the outpatient setting demonstrates that not all patients require hospitalization and that the safety and efficacy profile across a variety of types of clinical sites is consistent."06:20LLY Eli Lilly presents interim clinical data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 BRUIN dose escalation trial (119.64 )At all doses studied, LOXO-305 delivered objective responses in patients who had received diverse prior therapies and had exhibited varied molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.Of 16 CLL patients enrolled, there were 10 responders (8 partial responses, 2 partial response with ongoing lymphocytosis) among 13 patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 77% ORR. All patients with CLL have demonstrated tumor reduction, with evidence of deepening response over time. Responses were observed in patients with acquired resistance to prior BTK therapy (those with and without C481S mutations), in patients who were intolerant to prior BTK therapy, and in patients with acquired resistance to prior BCL2 therapy (including one with a known BCL G101V mutation). As expected, LOXO-305 treatment causes acute lymphocytosis, which resolves over time-a well described pharmacodynamic response associated with effective BTK inhibition. Of the three CLL patients not yet eligible for response assessment (one with the BTK C481S mutation), all three have demonstrated lymphocytosis early in cycle 1. All CLL responding patients remain in response and all CLL patients remain on study. Of eight MCL patients enrolled, there were three responses (1 complete response, 2 partial responses) among six patients eligible for response assessment, resulting in a 50% ORR. Two of the responders had progressed on prior BTK therapy (but without a documented C481x mutation). All MCL responding patients remain in response and on study. Three MCL patients discontinued therapy in cycle 1 due to progressive disease.Most treatment-emergent adverse events were Grade 1 in severity with the most commonly reported events, regardless of attribution, being fatigue (25% total: 21% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2) and diarrhea (18% total: 14% Grade 1, 4% Grade 2). Two adverse events =Grade 3 were attributed to LOXO-305 (Grade 3 leukocytosis and Grade 3 transient neutropenia). No dose limiting toxicities were reported and an MTD had not been reached.06:19AZN AstraZeneca reports full results from Phase III ELEVATE TN trial (47.68 )AstraZeneca presented results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ELEVATE TN trial, showing that CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) combined with obinutuzumab or as monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, a standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemiaIn an exploratory analysis, CALQUENCE in combination or alone demonstrated consistent PFS improvements across most pre-specified subgroups of patients with high-risk disease characteristics, including the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV), del(11q) and complex karyotype. Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of CALQUENCE observed in the ELEVATE TN trial was consistent with its known profile.06:19BGNE BeiGene presents clinical data from three trials of its BTK inhibitor BRUKINSA at ASH (186.92 )In two oral presentations of BRUKINSA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the drug candidate demonstrated consistent safety and a high overall response rate (ORR); in the poster presentation of BRUKINSA combined with BeiGene's investigational anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in patients with previously treated B-cell malignancies, the combination treatment showed preliminary efficacy and was generally well tolerated."The results presented today on BRUKINSA, a BTK inhibitor designed to maximize target occupancy and minimize off-target binding, demonstrated robust clinical activity and a safety profile consistent with what we've observed to date in our clinical trials, including safety data that supported the recent U.S. FDA accelerated approval in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma," said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, hematology at BeiGene. "CLL or SLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and despite the advancements of BTK inhibitor therapy for these cancers, there remains a need for highly selective BTK inhibitors capable of promoting long-term responses, and with a safety profile that is tolerable over time. The results presented here today further demonstrate the potential for BRUKINSA to help people living with these persistent, life-threatening cancers."06:18RCKT Rocket Pharmaceuticals presents 'encouraging' preliminary results from its Phase 1 trial of commercial-grade RP-L102 'Process B' for Fanconi Anemia (22.37 )Results presented in the poster highlight preliminary Phase 1 data from two pediatric patients (age 5 and 6 years) who were treated with "Process B" RP-L102 prior to the development of severe bone marrow failure and are in ongoing follow-up. Drug product was successfully manufactured using "Process B" optimization, including transduction enhancers, commercial-grade vector and modified cell processing. "Process B" drug product is manufactured to commercial grade standards, allowing for consistent drug product across patients and a vector copy number (VCN) two to three fold higher than that administered to optimally-treated "Process A" patients.Once transduced, drug product was infused fresh into patients without any prior conditioning regimen. To evaluate transduction efficiency, an analysis of the proportion of the MMC-resistant colony forming cells (CFC's) was conducted. Both patients exhibited early signs of engraftment based on peripheral blood, VCN and/or MMC-resistance. Preliminary phenotypic correction was also apparent in both patients, as evidenced by stabilization or increases in blood cell lineages. No safety or tolerability issues have been reported.06:18ABBV AbbVie reports new results from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE clinical trial showing the potential of this fixed-duration combination therapy (86.98 )AbbVie announced new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142) clinical trial,1 evaluating IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results showed that patients who received up to 12 cycles of the combination regimen achieved high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both peripheral blood (PB; 75 percent of patients) and in bone marrow (BM; 72 percent of patients). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO used as individual therapies.Results showed uMRD -- defined as less than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (MRD<0.01 percent) by flow cytometry of PB or BM samples -- was achieved at any time after baseline in PB for 75 percent of patients (122 of 163 patients) and in BM for 72 percent (111 of 155 patients). The proportion of patients who had uMRD in PB increased over time from 57 percent after 6 cycles, 68 percent after 9 cycles, and 73 percent after 12 cycles of IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. The high rates of uMRD in BM were consistent across high-risk subgroups, including in patients with del(17p), del(17p) or TP53 mutation, del(11q), complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV status. In patients with uMRD in PB with matched BM samples, 93 percent of patients had uMRD in both PB and BM. With median follow-up of 14.7 months, 3 patients (2 percent) experienced disease progression.06:17OBSV ObsEva reports positive Phase 3 trial results from PRIMROSE 2 trial of linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids (4.57 )The responder rate was 93.9% (p < 0.001) for women receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for women receiving 100 mg without ABT (p < 0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p < 0.001), reduction in pain (p < 0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p < 0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p < 0.001) in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. Furthermore, a significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p < 0.008).The overall safety profile was in line with expectations and confirmed that linzagolix was well-tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with previous clinical data."We look forward to the results from our second pivotal study, PRIMROSE 1 conducted in the US, in Q2 2020. Assuming positive results, we expect that it would lead to a Marketing Authorization Application submission with the European Medicines Agency by year-end 2020 and a New Drug Application submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Q1 2021."06:16THOR Synthorx to be acquired by Sanofi (SNY) for $68/share in cash (25.03 )Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.35 billion.

While the DOJ and SEC conduct separate investigations, the same facts have been shared by Ericsson with both authorities. The resolution relates to historical FCPA breaches ending Q1 2017. While the Company had a compliance program and a supporting control framework, they were not adequately implemented. Specifically, certain employees in some markets, some of whom were executives in those markets, acted in bad faith and knowingly failed to implement sufficient controls. They were able to enter into transactions for illegitimate purposes and, together with people under their influence, used sophisticated schemes in order to hide their wrongdoing.Separately, Ericsson agreed to resolve civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to allegations of violations of the bribery and accounting provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and it agreed to pay a financial sanction of $458,380,000, plus pre-judgment interest of $81,540,000.As part of the settlement, Ericsson has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years while the Company continues to undertake significant reforms to strengthen its Ethics & Compliance program.The combined payment of $1.06 b.

This may just be the calm before the storm considering all the macro-related events set to take place as the week unfolds. S&P Futures saw a relative quiet beginning with only a nine point overnight range. The market is currently trading around the 3144 area, with a high of 3148.50 and a low of 3139.50. In Asia, both China and Japan finished the day marginally higher. The Shanghai struggled to gain much following lighter than expected export data that saw a 1.1% fall in November, compared to a forecast of +0.8%.The Nikkei traded around in a narrow range that culminated with a gain of 0.3%. Heavyweights such as Softbank and Sony both gained more that 1% by day's end. European markets slightly under water. The weaker than expected Export data out of China has likely kept the EU markets in check.

AL002 is a monoclonal antibody intended to enhance the activity of TREM2 and is being developed by Alector for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with its partner AbbVie (ABBV). The data were presented today at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting. The AL002 presentation at CTAD showcases the first data in humans showing that a TREM2 activating antibody engages its target and demonstrates downstream activity in the CNS. The data reported today are from the study's SAD phase in 56 healthy adults, who were enrolled into nine escalating dose cohorts. AL002 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. AL002 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating proof-of-target engagement in the brain. AL002 elevated a biomarker for microglia activity in the CSF, indicating proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1b portion of the study in Alzheimer's disease patients is on-going.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD16:19WTRE Watford Holdings agrees to purchase Axeria IARD; terms not disclosed (26.47 +0.25)Axeria IARD is a property and casualty insurance company based in France.

Ninety-four percent of patients were refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody and 84% percent were triple refractory (refractory to an IMiD agent, PI and anti-CD38 antibody). Results for the primary endpoint (overall response rate [ORR]) and key secondary endpoint (complete response rate [CR]), as well as duration of response (DoR) and progression-free survival (PFS) across the target dose levels and at each of the three target doses explored in the study are presented in the table below. The median follow-up duration for all subjects was 11.3 months.Overall, the safety results were consistent with those observed in the phase 1 CRB-401 study, which evaluated the preliminary safety and efficacy of ide-cel. Instances of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 5.5% (7/128) of patients, including one fatal CRS event. Investigator identified grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity events (iiNT) occurred in 3.1% (4/128) of patients and there were no Grade 4 iiNT events reported. Grade 3 or higher CRS and iiNT events were reported in <6% of subjects at each target dose. CRS of any grade occurred in 83.6% (107/128) of patients and iiNT of any grade occurred in 18% (23/128) of patients.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

The tranquility in the futures trade has coincided with no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front and no economic data, but this week could include some noteworthy events.Both the Fed and ECB will hold policy meetings, but no changes in policy are expected. The market, meanwhile, continues to hope that some sort of deal between the U.S. and China will be announced before the tariffs on consumer goods hit on Dec. 15. Of course, some investors aren't convinced a deal may happen.Key reports this week will include the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -14.60.Wall Street is gearing up for a muted start, with the S&P 500 futures trading four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. The tranquility in the futures trade has coincided with no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front and no economic data, but this week could include some noteworthy events.Both the Fed and ECB will hold policy meetings, but no changes in policy are expected. The market, meanwhile, continues to hope that some sort of deal between the U.S. and China will be announced before the tariffs on consumer goods hit on Dec. 15. Of course, some investors aren't convinced a deal may happen.Key reports this week will include the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

Although no policy changes are expected from the central banks, the Fed will release updated interest-rate projections and it will be ECB President Christine Lagarde's first press conference.The major indices are little changed, but the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 7.1% to 14.61.

The tranquility in the futures trade has coincided with no reported progress on the U.S.-China trade front and no economic data, but this week could include some noteworthy events.Both the Fed and ECB will hold policy meetings, but no changes in policy are expected. The market, meanwhile, continues to hope that some sort of deal between the U.S. and China will be announced before the tariffs on consumer goods hit on Dec. 15. Of course, some investors aren't convinced a deal may happen.Key reports this week will include the Consumer Price Index for November on Wednesday and the Retail Sales report for November on Friday.

The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 56 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 14:00 ET  Page 92 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 15:00 ET  Page 99 of 842Senate Homeland Security Committee Issues Testimony From Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency  Page 102 of 842FCC bans use of USF funds for Huawei, ZTE equipment  Page  of Chinese National Faces Indictment For Economic Espionage  Page 112 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 10:00 ET  Page 122 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 11:00 ET  Page 133 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 12:00 ET  Page 145 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 13:00 ET  Page 159 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 14:00 ET  Page 161 of 842Trump says China is not "giving the size" in negotiations  Page 164 of 842TikTok admits that it hid disabled users' videos appearing on the app's main feed, claiming the 'blunt' policy was used prevent bullying  Page 166 of 842TikTok banned by US Navy, citing security concerns  Page 197 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 13:00 ET  Page 230 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 15:00 ET  Page 232 of 842Global stocks sink after Trump threatens more China tariffs  Page 239 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 09:00 ET  Page 246 of 842Briefing.com: Stock Market Update - 11:55 ET  Page 249 of 842Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei: "Spain's 5G network is going to be the best in Europe"  Page 251 of 842Beijing denounces New York Times' decision to publish leaked Xinjiang documents  Page 253 of 842Key findings in secret documents on China's detention camps  Page 255 of 842Watch the video featuring Osama bin Laden that TikTok says it suspended a teen over after her other video criticizing China went viral  Page 280 of 842Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 10:00 ET  Page 288 of 842REMARKS BY SECRETARY ESPER AT NATIONAL SECURITY COMMISSION ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PUBLIC CONFERENCE  Page 294 of 842Briefing.com: Stock Market Update - 10:55 ET  Page 296 of 842Consumer Technology Association Issues Statement on Phase One Trade Deal With China  Page 298 of 842China tells gaming arcades to ban children outside school holidays  Page 301 of 842Greater China Secure Content Management Market Report 2018 & 2019-2023: Regulatory Compliance Continues to Drive the Market  Page 310 of 842SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ON EAST ASIAN AND PACIFIC AFFAIRS  Page 314 of 842The 17-year-old who got suspended by TikTok after posting viral videos about oppressed Muslims accuses the company of lazy, racist assumptions about Islam and t....  Page 321 of 842SECRETARY MICHAEL R.
