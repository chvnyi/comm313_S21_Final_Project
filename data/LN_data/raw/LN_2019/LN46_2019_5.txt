IDTechEx Research Asks if 5G is Slowing Down in ChinaPR NewswireApril 8, 2019 Monday 12:45 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 560 wordsDateline: BOSTON, April 8, 2019 BodyPR Newswire China is set to be one of the biggest markets for 5G, alongside America and possibly Europe. There will be over 120 million 5G subscribers in 2022 and 1.5 billion by 2029 in China, about half of the total number globally, according to the new IDTechEx Research report '5G Technology, Market and Forecast 2019-2029'. However, it is not crazy to suspect that 5G is slowing down in China.Three main telecom carriers in China (e.g. China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom) announced their capital expenditure (capex) plan for 2019. The 5G capex is lower than expected. China Telecom will spend 9 billion CNY, slightly higher than China Unicom's plan of 6-8 billion. Market leader China Mobile did not disclose any number, but it is likely to be around 17 billion CNY. In total, the capax for 5G is estimated to be 34 bn CNY in China in 2019, which is much smaller than expected (50-100 bn CNY in 2019 and over 250 bn in 2020).One reason for the low expanse plan for 5G roll-out is the ongoing 4G network deployment. China Mobile alone has built 350K 4G station in 2018, more than double of the plan (140K). On the other hand, the revenue from each subscriber is declining, as the Chinese government urges to reduce the price for subscribers to use the cellular network. Facing the financial pressure, Chinese operators hesitate to throw money into the high-cost 5G roll-out without knowing if they will be able to earn money back. The CEO from Huawei, the top one telecom infrastructure supplier and number two smartphone provider in the world, has publicly expressed a similar concern on the payback from 5G.It is predicted that by 2030 the direct 5G revenue in China will be 6.3 trillion CNY (about $930 bn) and the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in the coming ten years will be 29 percent. 5G will create 8 million jobs and contribute around 5.8 percent GDP growth in China by 2030. The indirect revenue generated by 5G will be 10.6 trillion CNY (about $1,579 bn), with CAGR of 24 percent. Among them, the direct revenue for telecoms will be over $200 bn by 2029.As the current 5G deployment plan is slower than expected, these numbers might be overestimated. The new IDTechEx Research report '5G Technology, Market and Forecast 2019-2029' forecasts a moderated revenue of $160 bn for telecoms in China by 2029. Nonetheless, China is still the main market to watch. It is likely that the telecoms in China will at least invest $200-350 bn from 2020-2030 for 5G development, with the key focus on automotive, industry, healthcare and energy.

Huawei executive labeled a 'moral vacuum' in heated UK hearingCNN WireJune 11, 2019 Tuesday 4:05 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 597 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  A Huawei executive was denounced as a "moral vacuum" in a heated UK parliamentary committee hearing Monday, as lawmakers repeatedly compared the Chinese technology company to Nazi Germany collaborators.Huawei's global cybersecurity and privacy officer, John Suffolk, was asked multiple times by members of the Science and Technology Committee if the company had problems working with oppressive regimes.Huawei is in contention to help build part of the UK's super-fast 5G network and has faced increased scrutiny by government and security services. The United States has been pushing hard for the company to be banned from critical infrastructure projects in Europe, claiming it presents an unacceptable security risk."The company is deeply tied not only to China but to the Chinese Communist Party," US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month, after Washington placed Huawei on a trade blacklist.In Monday's hearing, Suffolk was questioned in particular about the use of Huawei technology in Chinese detention centers in the western region of Xinjiang, where the US claims up to 2 million Muslim-majority Uyghur may be held."You've demonstrated a willingness to work with the Chinese government in a province where there are allegedly gross human rights abuses -- that suggests a close working relationship with the Chinese government," the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, MP Norman Lamb, said. "Should it cause us concern in terms of your work here?"Suffolk said he wouldn't accept that characterization, adding the company condemned human rights abuses "in any country in which it occurs."He said it was up to governments to set laws in the countries where Huawei operated, and repeated the company's assertion that it was independent from the state.Suffolk's comments were described as "extraordinary" by committee members, while Conservative MP Julian Lewis labeled the Huawei executive as a "moral vacuum."Multiple comparisons were made by the UK MPs between Huawei's cooperation with Beijing and collaborators who worked with Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s."There's a lot of laws in China isn't there, just like there were a lot of laws in Nazi Germany," Lewis noted.'We stand naked in front of the world'Huawei has already been restricted from providing critical 5G infrastructure to the US as well as close allies such as Australia and New Zealand.There were reports in April that the UK would ban Huawei from sensitive parts of the country's communications infrastructure, while allowing the Chinese company to supply low-security networks.When pressed by UK MPs, Suffolk denied Huawei was "obligated" to work with Chinese intelligence services under the country's national security laws."We have looked at all of the Chinese laws, we have taken on board professors in Chinese laws ... and there is no requirement on us or any other company to undertake what you're suggesting," he said."We have never had a request from the Chinese government to do anything untoward."Lewis described Suffolk's response as "entirely unbelievable."But Suffolk said Huawei's products had been closely inspected by multiple customers and countries to alleviate concerns over hidden backdoors or malicious software."We stand naked in front of the world and it may not be a pretty sight all of the time but we would prefer to do that because it enables us to improve our products," he said."No can put us under pressure ... We would prefer to close the business."TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: June 12, 2019End of Document

ICYMI: MARCO RUBIO: CHINA 'CONTROLLING DEFENSE CYBER OPERATIONS' IN VENEZUELAStates News ServiceMay 9, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 560 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:Marco Rubio: China 'Controlling Defense Cyber Operations' in VenezuelaFrances MartelThe Chinese government has actively helped Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro control, censor, and shut down the Internet in his quest to keep the legitimate president of the country, Juan Guaid, from governing, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) told Breitbart News in an interview Monday.China's ruling Communist Party has used its foreign relations arms to subtly distance itself from Maduro this year. Unlike neighboring Russia, which openly boasts of having intervened militarily in the country on Maduro's behalf, China's Foreign Ministry has stopped short of referring to Maduro as the nation's president since Guaid took office in January and took nearly a week to issue an official statement on the military uprising Guaid called for on April 30. When it did, it urged a "peaceful settlement" without offering any specific statement of support for either Maduro or Guaid.Rubio suggested that Beijing may be distancing itself from Maduro because the tide has shifted so definitively against him in Latin America that the rest of the region may sour on investments with China if it interferes to help him. That does not mean China is not helping Maduro, merely that it cannot afford the bad press, Rubio stated."The Chinese are very involved. First of all, they are owed a bunch of money, so they want to get paid," he explained. "Number two is they are single-handedly helping conduct the Internet control operation. They have basically taken a commercial version of their great Internet firewall and given it to Maduro, and it is a service they are providing him, so they are the ones that are shutting down the Internet and access to social media."Maduro's regime regularly cuts nationwide access to the Internet to prevent Guaid and other opposition leaders from being able to communicate with the masses or organize rallies against him. Most Venezuelan opposition figures, like Maduro, are avid Twitter users. Last week, Guaid used Twitter to broadcast live from La Carlota, an airbase outside of Caracas, and declare the final step in removing Maduro, which he branded "Operation Freedom."Guaid, according to Rubio, has "no access to the media. Any time he tries to speak or communicate on social media, they shut down the Internet. ... Literally, every time he holds a rally, they shut down the Internet."As the Chinese are "single-handedly controlling the defensive cyber operations shutting down the Internet," they are responsible for silencing Guaid. Yet being more open about their role could jeopardize investments in other parts of the continent."The Chinese play a tricky game because on the one hand, they are trying to grow in influence and presence throughout Latin America, so they are seeing all of these countries supporting Guaid, and they don't want to ... antagonize these countries by being cheerleaders for the Maduro regime," Rubio noted."On the other hand, they view Venezuela as a place of strategic importance because they have an existing leverage relationship with him [Maduro], they're there on the ground, and the notion in their mind is they need to be against what they view as any American efforts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."Read the rest here.Load-Date: May 10, 2019End of Document

The 5G, the US war UU and ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 27, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 465 wordsBody This is how the newspaper El País relates: "the economic war being waged by China and the United States. It is the dispute for being the first implant 5G technology in the world. A commercial war, for technological reasons, that will impact the market, national security, industry, education and entertainment. So the country's fiercest defender of the free market and competition - the United States - resorts to state force to, through an unproven accusation of 'espionage', sanction the Chinese company 'Huawei', until now leading in the development of the technological career by 5G, the internet of things. President Trump states that "Huawei works as an undercover spy for the Chinese government," but does not provide proof of that.  The configuration of forces in this 'cold war' is as follows: Australia, New Zealand and the United States have banned Huawei. The United Kingdom and Japan established a partial ban. Germany, France, Italy and Spain are opposed to the United States veto. From the outset, 5G means three million jobs for China, in the short term. More than eight million in the medium term (2030). The 5G is the true access to the 'Smart Cities'. In the Made in China 2025, it is planet to turn this country into a world technological leader. The route is the 5G and, who controls the collection of the toll, will control the business ... Meanwhile, the Donald Trump government raises an ephemeral virtual wall of economic sanctions and vetoes, like the one that has not been able to build with steel and cement in the border with Mexico. The 'Huawei operation', actually seeks to stop China in world trade, by preventing it from becoming a leading country in the development and operation of 5G technology.  We are facing a war between the world's largest economies. Same that, paradoxically, are partners with a registered trade of over 700 billion dollars (during 2018). This is how the bipolar world of 5G technology begins, with geopolitical chess, on the board of patents and technology, for nothing less than the connectivity of the future! The 5G is that great way in which the locomotives of the large transnationals will have to move at great speed. A technology that already revolutionizes the industry, science, education, the way of life of people, the national security of countries, the digital financial world and the entertainment business.  For the United States to be Great Again, it requires that China and South Korea not take the lead in the development of 5G technology. In this war it is disputed, "who will define and control the model, the architecture and the agenda of the 5G, and that matters because the 5G is the great blue ocean of the cybernetic domain" (Declan Ganley, Communications CEO of Rivada Networks ) ...  gabtorre@hotmail.com Load-Date: May 27, 2019End of Document

How artificial intelligence systems could threaten democracyThe Conversation - United StatesApril 22, 2019 Monday 10:45 AM ESTCopyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 1170 wordsByline: Steven Feldstein, Frank and Bethine Church Chair of Public Affairs & Associate Professor, School of Public Service, Boise State UniversityHighlight: Even governments in democracies with strong traditions of rule of law find themselves tempted to abuse these new abilities.BodyU.S. technology giant Microsoft has teamed up with a Chinese military university to develop            artificial intelligence systems that could potentially enhance government surveillance and censorship capabilities. Two            U.S. senators publicly condemned the partnership, but what the            National Defense Technology University of China wants from Microsoft isn't the only concern.As my research shows, the advent of digital repression is profoundly affecting            the relationship between citizen and state. New technologies are arming governments with unprecedented capabilities to monitor, track and surveil individual people. Even governments in democracies with strong traditions of            rule of law find themselves tempted to abuse            these new abilities.In states with unaccountable institutions and frequent human rights abuses, AI systems will most likely cause greater damage. China is a prominent example. Its leadership has enthusiastically embraced AI technologies, and has set up the world's            most sophisticated           surveillance state in            Xinjiang province, tracking citizens' daily movements and smartphone use.Its exploitation of these technologies presents a chilling model for fellow autocrats and poses a direct threat to open democratic societies. Although there's no evidence that other governments have replicated this level of AI surveillance, Chinese companies are actively exporting the same underlying technologies across the world.Increasing reliance on AI tools in the USArtificial intelligence systems are everywhere in the modern world, helping run smartphones, internet search engines, digital voice assistants and Netflix movie queues.            Many people fail to realize how quickly AI is expanding, thanks to ever-increasing amounts of data to be analyzed, improving algorithms and advanced computer chips. Any time more information becomes available and analysis gets easier, governments are interested - and not just authoritarian ones. In the U.S., for instance, the 1970s saw revelations that government agencies - such as the FBI, CIA and NSA - had set up expansive domestic surveillance networks to monitor and harass civil rights protesters, political activists and Native American groups. These issues haven't gone away: Digital technology today has deepened the ability of even more agencies to conduct even more intrusive surveillance.For example, U.S. police have eagerly embraced AI technologies. They have begun using software that is meant to predict where crimes will happen to decide where to send officers on patrol. They're also using            facial recognition and            DNA analysis in criminal investigations. But analyses of these systems show the            data on which those systems are trained are often biased, leading to            unfair outcomes, such as            falsely determining that African Americans are more likely to commit crimes than other groups.AI surveillance around the worldIn authoritarian countries, AI systems can directly abet domestic control and surveillance, helping internal security forces process massive amounts of information - including social media posts, text messages, emails and phone calls - more quickly and efficiently. The police can identify social trends and            specific people who might threaten the regime based on the information uncovered by these systems. For instance, the Chinese government has used AI in wide-scale crackdowns in regions that are home to ethnic minorities within China. Surveillance systems in Xinjiang and Tibet have been described as "Orwellian." These efforts have included            mandatory DNA samples, Wi-Fi network monitoring and widespread facial recognition cameras, all connected to integrated data analysis platforms. With the aid of these systems, Chinese authorities have, according to the U.S. State Department, "arbitrarily detained" between            1 and 2 million people.My research looks at 90 countries around the world with government types ranging from closed authoritarian to flawed democracies, including Thailand, Turkey, Bangladesh and Kenya. I have found that Chinese companies are            exporting AI surveillance technology to at least 54 of these countries. Frequently, this technology is packaged as part of China's flagship            Belt and Road Initiative, which is funding an extensive network of roads, railways, energy pipelines and telecommunications networks            serving 60% of the world's population and economies that generate 40% of global GDP.For instance, Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE are constructing "smart cities" in            Pakistan,            the Philippines and            Kenya, featuring extensive built-in surveillance technology. For example, Huawei has outfitted            Bonifacio Global City in the Philippines with high-definition internet-connected cameras that provide "           24/7 intelligent security surveillance with data analytics to detect crime and help manage traffic."Hikvision,            Yitu and            SenseTime are supplying state-of-the-art facial recognition cameras for use in places like            Singapore - which announced the establishment of a surveillance program with            110,000 cameras mounted on lamp posts around the city-state. Zimbabwe is creating a            national image database that can be used for facial recognition.However, selling advanced equipment for profit is different than sharing technology with an express geopolitical purpose. These new capabilities may plant the seeds for global surveillance: As governments become increasingly dependent upon Chinese technology to manage their populations and maintain power, they will face greater pressure to align with China's agenda. But for now it appears that China's primary motive is to dominate the market for new technologies and make lots of money in the process. AI and disinformationIn addition to providing surveillance capabilities that are both sweeping and fine-grained, AI can help repressive governments manipulate available information and spread disinformation. These campaigns can be automated or automation-assisted, and deploy hyper-personalized messages directed at - or against -            specific people or groups. AI also underpins the technology commonly called "deepfake," in which algorithms create            realistic video and audio forgeries. Muddying the waters between truth and fiction may become useful in a tight election, when one candidate could create fake videos showing an opponent doing and saying things that never actually happened.In my view, policymakers in democracies should think carefully about the risks of AI systems to their own societies and to people living under authoritarian regimes around the world. A critical question is how many countries will adopt China's model of digital surveillance. But it's not just authoritarian countries feeling the pull. And it's also not just Chinese companies spreading the technology: Many U.S. companies, Microsoft included, but IBM, Cisco and Thermo Fisher too, have provided sophisticated capabilities to nasty governments. The misuse of AI is not limited to autocratic states.Steven Feldstein is a non-resident fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Load-Date: April 22, 2019End of Document

Apple Earnings Could See 8% Hit From Trump's Huawei Blacklist, Cowen SaysTheStreet.comMay 28, 2019 Tuesday 10:58 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 417 wordsByline: Jacob SonenshineHighlight: An outright ban on Apple products by the Chinese government would have even more dire consequences, according to Cowen analyst Krish Sankar.BodyThe risks to Apple  from the intensifying U.S.-China trade war appear to be growing, analysts say.Apple could see an 8% hit to earnings per share if iPhone demand in the China region slips as a result of President Trump's ban on doing business with Huawei, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a note on Tuesday."We believe the international perception that Huawei is being targeted and unfairly punished as a parallel story in the U.S. and China trade spat could lead Chinese consumers to retaliate as patriotism leads them to support domestic brands while products and services from US companies fall out of favor," Sankar wrote.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives acknowledged the same concern last week when he wrote that both the U.S.'s tariffs and the Huawei issue could spark nationalistic sentiment in Chinese consumers, so much so that  to some extent. Sankar also mentioned the extreme possibility that the Chinese government could enact a formal ban on iPhones."We estimate 5-30% unit demand destruction across all hardware sales in China could impact EPS by 1-8%," Sankar wrote. "In the extreme case of 100% demand destruction in China (iPhones banned), we estimate a ~26% impact to FY20 EPS." Every one-percentage point decline in Apple's revenue growth would translate into a 22 cent decline in EPS, Sankar estimated. FedEx  is also hoping not to receive similar retaliation from the Chinese government and/or consumers, after the company had to  on Tuesday. FedEx was accused of diverting these packages deliberately.Sankar noted that his Apple estimates on demand destruction in China would be in addition to the impact of the U.S.'s tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S, which would increase Apple's supply-chain costs. Some analysts say those tariffs would bring  from above $12 a share to about $9 a share. Apple's stock were trading down 0.45% to $178.16 on Tuesday morning. Shares are still up 13% this year, however. Sankar estimated that a full ban in China on iPhones would bring 2019 EPS down to $8.29, without accounting for the effect of tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S.Apple currently trades at 14.1 times consensus EPS forecasts for 2020 of $12.65, according to FactSet. Keeping that multiple on 2020 EPS of $10 would translate into a share price of $141, but analysts have yet to formally move their estimates and price targets down, as the situation with China plays out. Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's .

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, April 23rd. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. We are watching earnings this morning. A whole host of earnings out today and for the week. This is one of busiest weeks for the first quarter.Take a look at these moves. Coca-Cola, 3-1/4 percent. Twitter up better than six percent. Lockheed Martin up 6-1/3 percent. All of the above beating earnings expectations on the top and bottom line. Markets are showing a mixed story at the opening of trading however. Take a look at futures indicating the Dow Industrials up 58 points, the S&P 500 up two and the NASDAQ up 4-3/4. Things have decidedly positive on the heels of all of these earnings.Coke and United Technologies for example, those two stocks alone are adding more than 40 points to the Dow Industrials at the opening of trading this morning as we are expecting a firmer tone at the start of trading this morning. Yesterday, well, it was a mixed story for the most part. Fractional movers. The Dow Industrials were down 48 points yesterday at 4:00 on Wall Street.The S&P 500 was up three and the NASDAQ was up 17. European indices this morning look like this and we do have mixed story there as well. FT-100 up 35 points, the CAC Quarante is down seven and the DAX Index in Germany down 26. In Asia overnight, markets were fractionally moving exactly unchanged in Hong Kong. Shanghai Composite in China down one-half of one percent.Oil continues to be the story of the day for markets, after the U.S. ended all Iran sanction exceptions. Oil stores yesterday and it is continuing that run this morning up another fraction of a point, up to $65.34 points a barrel on oil light sweet crude. The power of social media credit card issuers boosting ad spending on Facebook to attract new borrowers.Plus, big Bitcoin loss. The son of the founder of SoftBank taking a mega $134-million hit on the cryptocurrency. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, radio host, new leader senior fellow and Fox News Contributor Richard Fowler, and CFA Investment Strategists, Lindsey Bell. Great to see everybody this morning.RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Somebody -- a viewer on Twitter asked about why do we care about oil production in Iran here in the United States and it was --BARTIROMO: Good question.MCDOWELL: -- right -- it's because oil is fungible, it's largely interchangeable around the globe and it's priced on the world market. So the production anywhere whether it's Iran, Russia Saudi Arabia, it impacts the price of the oil that -- here in the United States.BARTIROMO: That's the bottom line, it's a global market. So when you take oil out of that globally market everybody is impacted.FOWLER: I think oil impact so many industries and impacts your air fares, it impacts what you're paying at the pump, it impacts your groceries. So oil has an impact on literally every piece of consumer goods in the market place.BARTIROMO: So you wonder if oil is an indicator of things to come or if it is actually an impacter of things to come. So, is oil up to $65 a barrel because it is an indicator that the global economy is doing well or is it about to squeeze consumers because gasoline prices are going to go up and an indicator of perhaps the economy is going to slow down? I don't know, I go back-and-forth on this.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: I think it's -- you know, it's a difference between supply and demand, it's always moving oil. You have to look at both sides of the equation. And Tom Kloza was talking really loud about the supply-side of the issue but what about demand right now? That was -- it's what took the oil prices down in the fourth quarter last year. And also helped bring it back up when the global demand worries sort of eased into the first part of this year. We'll see what happens as we move forward.MCDOWELL: The issue that Tom Kloza brought with up more than anything was why now, why couldn't the administration wait to use maximum pressure later this year when it wouldn't show up at the pump heading into the summer driving season when you have peak demand here in the United States, when the Permian basin and the other shale producers might be able to get more barrels on the market to offset any supply cuts.BARTIROMO: Well, part of the issue was the deadline for those exceptions was May 2nd.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: But they could have kept it in a waivers until later in the year but they decided to do it now in the spring for whatever reason I have not --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: I mean, I tend to agree with Dagen. I'm not sure if that's the -- I mean, going into knowing that the price is going to go up in red states when it is driving season, people are driving to see grandma, driving to see grandpa, driving to see aunts and uncles to do it now seems to be a little bit interesting, an interesting move for this White House knowing that they need to convince these people and just a couple months that they need to reelect this president.BARTIROMO: Well, there was -- there was a lot of upset by countries that didn't get exemptions. So you've got these eight countries that had exemptions from the sanctions against Iran and they were, you know, buying Iranian oil, and I guess the administration doesn't want any more exemptions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, zero yesterday.BELL: And that was unexpected to go all the way to zero and this is also another -- going back to timing, we're in the middle of trade talks with China and China was the major -- one of the major players that was receiving these waivers.MCDOWELL: You know why?(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Maybe that's it.MCDOWELL: You know why we can do it now verses even a few years ago because of the policies in part coming out of this administration, we are stronger in terms of oil production than we have ever been. It's a national security issue where, we're the world's number one oil producer right now. And again, the more we control our own energy production, the more power we have over nations that hate us.BARTIROMO: You're right. Deregulation, open this bigot for sure. I want to turn to the Mueller report fallout. Democratic leaders backing away from launching impeachment proceedings against the President but some 2020 presidential hopefuls will not let go. Kevin Corke is covering the story this morning. He's at the White House. Kevin, good morning to you.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. The President actually asked that question on Twitter yesterday, you are busy, you may not have seen this but a lot of people at home, I'm going to help you out and the President asked succinctly and he's been talking about impeachment. He said this, how do you impeach a Republican president for a crime that was committed by Democrats? Make America great again.Well, if you listen to Democrats, they say, all you have to do, Maria is look at the Mueller report because their argument is there is plenty there that would at least give them a reason to pursue impeachment. Well, Nancy Pelosi was on a conference call last night with other Democrats, she said this, we have to save our democracy. This isn't about Democrats or Republicans, it's about saving our democracy.If it's what we need to do to honor our responsibility to the constitution, if that's the place, the facts take us. Well, that's the place we have to go. On Capitol Hill, Republicans are convinced however that impeachment will do nothing but hurt the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Here is where I think in the -- is going on in the House. There is going to be a stampede to impeach President Trump, they're going to use the Mueller report anything they can find to try to destroy his presidency. Nancy Pelosi is not in charge of the Democratic Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)CORKE: Meanwhile, a number of Democrats running for the 2020 nomination will actually ask about this very topic in a town hall last night. Interesting. Some were saying, yes, go with the impeachment like Elizabeth Warren. Others saying we need to have this conversation like Kamala Harris. But then there was Bernie sanders, Maria, and he said something important. He said, if Democrats are talking about Trump and Mueller and impeachment in 2020, they're not talking about issues like healthcare that matters to most Democratic voters and that he said will lead to a Trump victory.We do not expect to see the President today on camera, that can change. If it does, I promise to let you know but for now back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Kevin. Thank you so much. Kevin Corke at the White House. Joining me now for reaction, Colorado Senator, member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Commerce and Energy committees, Cory Gardner. Senator, it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.SEN. CORY GARDNER (R-CO): Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: So what about --GARDNER: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Look, we look at the -- we look at the border and obviously it's a crisis situation. We look at North Korea, we look at, you know, immigration and healthcare being among the top issues for the American people and, yet, we can't get the attention of Democrats because they are so focused on investigating Donald Trump. How is this going to play out?GARDNER: Yes. I characterize the House right now as a revenge majority, trying to seek revenge on a president they think never should have been elected. And they're going to spend the next year and a half before the election trying to seek revenge. And that's why Speaker Pelosi is about to find herself a speaker without a conference because she is going to be forced to deal with impeachment.There is no doubt that the rank-and-file in her conference are going to demand impeachment. You got presidential candidates dragging them toward impeachment. That's what they're going to -- instead of focusing on terrorism, instead of focusing on our economy, instead of focusing on the crisis at the borders, they're going to be talking about impeachment of the president of United States even though the report said no collusion or no cooperation by any American.And so that's exactly what you're going to see this revenge majority in the House of Representatives continue to pursue.BARTIROMO: Well, that's the thing. I mean, look, Nancy Pelosi is not stupid, Nancy Pelosi has been incredibly smart and strong throughout an incredible career with sharp elbows that she had to push back on lots of men and women to get ahead throughout her career. If she thought there was even a chance that there was anything impeachable, she wouldn't be saying this. So, she knows there's nothing there and she's trying to rein them in.But look, as Doug Collins says, Congressman Collins says AOC is the co- speaker. So she's having a hard time with those.GARDNER: If it's exactly right, she's not going to be able to control or contain the social media elements of her conference. They've been so successful in ginning up this activist elemental of their base that wants to see the impeachment. I mean, this goes back to 2016 election back to the 2017 majority in the Senate of the House and the President. And revenge, you look at subpoenas that are being issued, you look at the things that are being said about Bob Mueller now that he wrote a report that didn't go the way they wanted it to. And I think that's exactly what she's going to be faced with.BARTIROMO: Yes. The thing is this, I think the American people see through this, OK? And that's the problem for Nancy Pelosi. Because they're seeing through some of this craziness, in the radical part of her party. Meanwhile, there's China, people understand what's happened with China as well, Huawei Technologies introduced 5G hardware that can be built into smart cars. So you are part of this bipartisan effort that is warning against expanding Chinese 5G technology like Huawei or ZTE in the United States.Tell us about that. We've have covered China and Huawei quite extensively and I think effectively, give us the sales pitch. What are you trying to tell people about Huawei?GARDNER: Well, Huawei, I mean, look, this is not a Republican or Democrat only concern. This is not a partisan issue, this is not a Donald Trump administration concern. This is an American concern, this is a nonpartisan concern. This is something that is going to last beyond any Republican or Democratic Congress or beyond any one administration. The concerns over Huawei because what they have done is built an information system and that can scrape information that can be put together in a way that allows information to be gathered, to be taken and to be used against the U.S. companies, U.S. interest and certainly U.S. security.And for our allies in Europe to think that we're just going to turn away or turn another cheek and not pay attention or let this issue die after the 2020 election, it will not. This is going to continue. And so, I've introduced a resolution along with Chris Coons, a Democratic from Delaware to tell our allies around the globe that if you move forward with Huawei throughout your critical infrastructure systems, your networks, we're going to have to take actions.Maybe that means removal of a facility, maybe that means that we share less information but it will repercussions and consequences because we believe threat is too real to our security and our economy.BARTIROMO: And in fact, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been trying to communicate that message to the Europeans, Africans but Huawei has made real, you know, leeway in terms of setting up the infrastructure systems but in several European countries and certainly throughout Africa, isn't that right? Because it's cheaper.GARDNER: Well, it is right and that's why -- that's why we have to really focus on a couple things. Number one, we have to focus on engagement through things like the Build Act, the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act to provide ways, to help U.S. business compete and outcompete Huawei which is subsidized by the -- by the Chinese government. And what we have to do also is make sure that we have the equipment and the ability to compete with Huawei and ZTE.Sometimes I talk to leaders and they say, well, look, we'd love the U.S. company but we don't think that there's a U.S. company that can provide what Huawei is providing to us. So we have to make sure that we have the industrial capacity, the technology, the telecoms' capacity to compete directly with what Huawei is trying to provide at bargain-based prices to Africa, Europe and anywhere else around the globe to make sure that they are not putting in this threat to security and economy.BARTIROMO: So, how do they do it? There is -- they can just, you know, circle back any information and because their - it's obviously espionage and they are spying, they can just send all of that information data back to this Chinese government because I had on an executive from Huawei and I brought up the list of companies that have sued Huawei. And they settled like Microsoft, like Cisco, T-Mobile because Huawei has stolen trade secrets and he said, look, we're not stealing anything and we're not reporting back to the Chinese government.And I said to him straight out, well, do you have you communists on your board? And then it was like, oh, well, yes, because there are obviously communists Chinese government officials on the board.(CROSSTALK)GARDNER: I mean, that's the thing. Yes. Exactly, right. I mean, look, you've got communist parties being -- members being placed on boards, it's not just of Huawei but of companies around China. U.S. companies are being forced to enter into state joint venture agreements, they are competing against data owned enterprises, they're forced to transfer intellectual property rights. This is just not fair.BARTIROMO: Is this part of the deal? I mean, is this -- is this coming up in the conversation about a deal between the U.S. and China on trade?GARDNER: Absolutely it's coming up every day. I think it comes up every time they meet. They're talking about Huawei concerns, talking about intellectual property, talking about forced transfer of intellectual property rights and they have to because that's what is -- what is wrong with China. Look, I don't like tariffs but the bottom line is this, we have to stand up to China. We have to make sure that our trade with China is fair.And right now, they're stealing hundreds of billions of dollars a year intellectual property from the United States. I meet with businesses that are concerned about back doors into bank accounts, they're being told who can be put on their board. This is not fair, this is not a new China making progressive reforms. They're stepping backwards and it's a frightening thing.BARTIROMO: It was Microsoft former CEO Steve Ballmer who told me that 90 percent of the companies in China have the Microsoft operating system, one percent actually pay for it. It cost Microsoft $10 billion a year in profits which was just an extraordinary number. That's just one company. Senator, it's good to see you. Thank you so much, Senator Cory Gardner joining us there. Coming up, earnings in focus. We are all over Twitter. Stock is soaring this morning. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Lots of double beats for companies reporting earnings today. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details of what has been a pretty good earnings period for the first quarter so far, Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, Maria. All four of these companies are reporting a double beat, starting with Coca-Cola, they're setting strong demand for water and soft drinks. Shares up three percent expectations of 46 cents a share and 7.88 billion on revenues coming in at 48 cents a share and eight billion in revenues. Let's take a look at United Technologies where bust demand for aircraft parts essentially fueling this double beat.Expectations of $1.71 and 17.98 on the top line but they come in at $1.91 and 18.4 billion. So, shares up about 3.5 cents currently. Number three, Twitter, a double beat here. Shares are soaring this morning opening up -- or coming in up 10 percent, now at seven percent. EPS expectation of 15 cents a share, they come in at 37 cents a share. Revenue, 775.6 million coming in at 787 actual.What's going on here, here's a real number to pay attention to with Twitter. Monthly active users up nine million. The estimate was a decline in monthly active users. It may be a see sign of the social media company has found a sustainable path forward. And finally, Lockheed Martin, double beat on for the world's biggest defense company here. They raised their 2019 profit and guidance on revenues. 4.34 and 12.59 billion revenues.The expectation coming in at 5.99 and 14.34 billion revenue actual. So big morning for earnings for all of these companies, Maria. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thanks so much. And markets have obviously responded, we're expecting a higher opening for the Dow Industrials this morning and the broader averages. Coming up. We're focusing on the Fed. Herman Cain taking himself out of consideration for seat on the Federal Reserve board.Plus, big Bitcoin loss. The billionaire founder of SoftBank taking a major hit, $130-million hit on the cryptocurrency. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Futures this morning decidedly positive now after a whole host of companies reported better-than-expected earnings this morning. Take a look, Dow Industrials now indicating it will be up about 70 points at the start of trading. Futures right now up 73 points on the Dow, S&P futures up 3-3/4 and the NASDAQ futures up 12 points right now. Joining us right now is Alger Fund CEO and CIO, Dan Chung. And Dan, it is good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.DANIEL CHUNG, CEO AND CIO, ALGER FUND: Thank you.BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to what we've seen in the first quarter earnings so far? You're big investor in technology. How would you characterize the numbers you've seen?CHUNG: You know, a lot of -- there's a lot of concern because of the trade war, you know, the fourth quarter last year was a rocky one. And whether in some respect. But in the end, they're -- so far, they're coming in pretty good.BARTIROMO: Right. So, you -- what -- in terms of technology in particular, you're invested in the cloud, you don't own Twitter but you think you know why the Twitter stock performance is so strong today.CHUNG: Yes. I mean, we're -- we see average users were up instead of down. So, people were expecting them to decline (INAUDIBLE) which has been a pattern for them, they seem to turn to a positive which is a big positive change for them.FOWLER: So Dan, on healthcare, so we saw last week the markets sort of do this sort of rollercoaster ride, it went down for a little bit, they went up for a little bit.MCDOWELL: Let me do it for you. And then they came back.FOWLER: I mean, some say it's because, you know, what Bernie said, some say it's because Joe Biden is getting the raise. But what are you guys looking at as your indicator on how healthcare stocks do in the future?CHUNG: Well, healthcare clearly is a sector where the regulatory and political environment matters a lot. And so, we're looking at, you know, the Democratic and Republican conventions and the nominees and the proposals. And I think it is appropriate to be a little bit more cautious about healthcare which has been a very strong sector for multiple years. And think about opportunities in healthcare that for example are less politically sensitive and more driven by innovation and technology.Because healthcare is a really interesting sector and that it has, you know, the insurance and HMOs and it also has companies and extremely technology driven. And we've really like the areas where whether it's software and analytics, genetics are being applied or whether it's, you know, med tech devices. These are still very vibrant areas within healthcare and sort of where we're turning our focus.MCDOWELL: You know, I just like to point out, it was the health insurers that fell out of bed really after the Bernie Sanders town hall because he kind of, you know, he softened the rough edges as Karl Rove said on socialism and his plan for Medicare for All would get -- essentially get rid of private insurance in this country. So I just want to explain that.BARTIROMO: That's the component of healthcare that actually traded down.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: The way you said. What about the Federal Reserve, Dan? I mean, the board set to hold an open meeting today to discuss their proposal and simplify an increased transparency of rules. This is President Trump says Herman Cain has asked not to be considered for the board he was the obviously the President's pick for a board governor seat at the Federal Reserve. Your reaction to the Fed, its moves, obviously out of the way now for a little while. Does that mean that's a positive for the stock market?CHUNG: I think the out of the way is actually one of the most important things that investors should be focused on. We've seen in past instances the yield curve goes relatively flat and the Fed goes on pause. As long as we don't head into recession, we certainly don't see that in our analysts that work at Alger. Equities actually performed extremely well. 20 plus percent is actually the average return from a Fed pause like that.BARTIROMO: So you think we'll have that kind of a year this year?CHUNG: I think we could.BELL: Do you think that the Fed will cut rates at the end of the year because there's a 30 percent chance being priced into the market in September, October, December potentially because when they do move back and they start cutting rates, that's when you usually see recession right around the corner.CHUNG: If I'm smiling it's because about nine months ago, you know, the same prediction was predicting four -- three to four rate hikes this year. No, I don't think they will cut -- I think they're on pause.BARTIROMO: So they're just on pause, so -- and the backdrop? What you gain from these earnings that we've seen, how does the backdrop feel to you?CHUNG: So, the backdrop looks good because -- well, the first quarter is a little bit weaker, I think there is a pickup in earnings growth throughout the year with the Fed on pause, investors should take comfort in really about attractive earnings yields in the S&P 500 and also global equities and so I'm looking for a pretty strong year.MCDOWELL: I will briefly add that some of the thinking is the economy is going to not only earnings but the economy will be picking up steam. We saw that really good print on retail sales last week as the economy picks up steam, the narrative again flips back to the Fed where you have yields going up and concern that the Fed is not on pause, the concern that the Fed will hike at the end of the year because their -- if the economy looks a little bit hotter, inflation picks up steam in the next say quarter of next six months. That could be the narrative that you start hearing as we go into the summer.BARTIROMO: We're back right now at the Goldilocks economy. So you can't figure out if it's too hot, too cold, right?CHUNG: That is right.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Wage gains that are running at a 10-year high and core inflation that's below two percent, that's as good as it gets and a Fed on pause.BARTIROMO: Are you largely vested in the U.S. or do you want to start looking at Europe because some people think that Europe is showing actually some signs of coming out of the down trend that has been in for so long.CHUNG: So we do run some global international funds that we're invested in Europe, but in our funds it can go anywhere. I would say that we're still overweight the U.S. significantly and in particular actually what's interesting to us is going down market cap into small caps. Small caps are actually undervalued relative to large caps historically. The very U.S. exposed but they're else benefiting from the innovation technology E- Commerce, right? A lot of IPOs coming. So there's a lot of excitement at least at Alger on the small midcap area.BARTIROMO: What's your AUM at these days, Dan?CHUNG: Twenty-seven billion.BARTIROMO: Congratulations. Good to see you. Thanks so much. Dan Chung joining us there. Coming up. Big Bitcoin losses. The billionaire founder of SoftBank takes a $130-million hit on the cryptocurrency. Then the power of social media, credit card issuers boosting ad spending on Facebook to attract new borrowers. We've got that after this break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks for so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, April 23rd. Your top stories right now 8:33 a.m. on the East Coast. We are watching earnings this morning. Twitter moving up in a big way, after reporting a surprise rise in monthly active users. The stock is up 6-3/4 percent. Coca-Cola and United Technologies also beat expectations, poised to add better than 40 points at the Dow Industrials at the open. Futures indicating a firmer tone to the start of trading this morning, Dow Futures are up 63 points, off of the lows but certainly just shy of the highs of the morning as well. Quarter of a percent higher. S&P Futures up 2-1/2, and the NASDAQ Futures up 8-1/2 points right now.European indices mostly higher, although more of a mixed story here. FT- 100 is up 33 points, that's the high of the morning for the FT, but the CAC Quarante has turned negative. It's down seven, and the DAX Index in Germany down 21. In Asia overnight, fractional moves across the board, take a look, big performer was the Shanghai Composite, it was down just about one-half of one percent.Big Bitcoin loss, SoftBank's founder is taking a huge $130 million hit on the cryptocurrency. Of course it's had an incredibly volatile and down year. Plus the power of social media, credit card issuers boosting advertising spending on Facebook to attract new borrowers. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning. But first, our top story this half an hour, the fallout from the Mueller report. My next guest is out with a new op-ed in The Hill. It is titled "And the winner of the Mueller -- the Robert Mueller Sweepstakes is Vladimir Putin," writing that Vladimir Putin "found a way through hacking Clinton's e-mails and seeding information for him the Steele and the Trump Tower meeting to cast doubt on both candidates in 2016. Now in the prose of the Mueller report, he has a fresh vehicle to continue selling discord and distrust in America, and its duly-elected President for months."I can almost hear the boisterous laughter emanating from the Kremlin," writes John Solomon. Joining me right now is Journalist John Solomon. And it is good to see you, John. Thanks so much for joining us.JOHN SOLOMON, JOURNALIST: Good to be here with you, Maria. Yes.BARTIROMO: I love talking to you because I know that you've been on it and you were seeking the truth like I was as well for the last two years. So, congratulations on being --SOLOMON: Uh-hmm. Thank you.BARTIROMO: -- on the right side of history --SOLOMON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: -- these last two years. You think this whole ordeal has just done what Vladimir Putin wanted to do in the beginning?SOLOMON: It's funny. When we started and President Obama left us with the first assessment, it was that the Kremlin was trying to help Trump get elected and defeat Hillary Clinton. If you talk to intelligence people today -- I talked to the CIA -- former CIA Station Chief in Moscow, he says there's a new assessment coming, that Putin was really trying to destabilize both sides and that what they did to Trump at the Trump Tower meeting and other events like that, are what is known as discoverable intelligence operations. Meaning they wanted them to be discovered so that Americans would scratch their head and say, "Is Russia trying to help Donald Trump or what?"And so looking back in hindsight, after everything we've been through. The intelligence committee is starting to have a very different assessment about what happened in 2016.BARTIROMO: Now we knew back in 2014 that Russia was trying to undermine the U.S.SOLOMON: That's right.BARTIROMO: How come U.S. didn't do anything about it?SOLOMON: Well --BARTIROMO: How come we have to talk about this after the 2016 election where we knew for two years?SOLOMON: That's right. Devin Nunes issued a warning in 2014 that was very clear. Listen, one of the big losers of the Mueller report is Barack Obama. He sat there and watched this play out for months, maybe because he thought Hillary was invincible. But at the end of the day, he didn't do enough to protect our country from the meddling that did occur. And you take collusion aside, you still have the threat of Russia meddling and we're going into 2020 Elections, it looks like this administration is taking a lot more assertive steps and the next election may be a lot safer than the last one.BARTIROMO: I like your op-ed --SOLOMON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: -- titled "10 post-Mueller questions that could turn the tables on the Russia collusion investigators." So now we're at a point where we're saying, "OK, let's investigate the investigators given the fact that --SOLOMON: Right.BARTIROMO: -- now we know that they launched an investigation into Donald Trump for no reason, no predicate --SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- simply because they didn't like him and they wanted Hillary to win the opponent on -- in a presidential campaign.SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: So tell us about these 10 post questions.SOLOMON: Well, these are the questions that the Inspector General -- Attorney General Barr focusing on now in their post-action review. I think that at the end, they all sum up to one big question, was it the FBI the CIA used for political dirty trick to first try to defeat Donald Trump in the election, and then if not defeat him, delegitimize his victory after he became President. I think there's growing body evidence that that's what really went on. When you look at the tweets, the text messages, and all of the evidences now coming forward, you can see that -- I think the first fundamental question that everyone has to get answered is when did the FBI know that Hillary Clinton was funding the Steele dossier?Once we know that, then why did you proceed with it with all the flaws? You heard Bob Woodward call it garbage and the media was parading this around two years ago as the Holy Grail, now it's garbage. When did you know the flaws and why did you give it to the court?BARTIROMO: Well -- and Jim Comey continues to say I didn't know that Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier.SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: How do you not know it? You're the FBI Director. DO you just use any old garbage that somebody brings you and says, "Oh, let me go spy on an American citizen --SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- since I have this?"SOLOMON: Ignorance not a defense before the FISA Court. He had an obligation to certify that that evidence was accurate and also that it was free from derogatory information like a political connection with Hillary Clinton funding it. His ignorance defense is not going to hold up in the court of public opinion or law.BARTIROMO: You know, it was such an incredible strategy that the left had to take down Donald Trump.SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: It wasn't just, you know, the Steele dossier, but they put informants in there --SOLOMON: Right.BARTIROMO: -- had informants meet with Donald Trump, JR. and others --SOLOMON: Right.BARTIROMO: -- to try to get them talking about policy, so then later they could say, "Oh, you're talking about policy." Then you had the media strategy. Mark Meadows broke some news on my show last week --SOLOMON: He did.BARTIROMO: -- on Sunday --SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- by saying this media strategy that's about to come out --SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- what do you know about this? Whereas they planted stories in the media, Yahoo Finance picked it up.SOLOMON: That's right.BARTIROMO: Mother Jones picked it up, and then those stories were printed and published and then they used those same stories as evidence "for the FISA Court" to get the warrant to spy on Carter Page.SOLOMON: Yes. We've seen this. We've seen text messages that -- we're talking about a leaked strategy. It looks like they planted stories in the media so they could use it as evidence in the FISA Court to bulk up a dossier that they clearly knew was insufficient and weak. And so if that went on, and that's one of the questions the I.G. is looking at, that's one of the questions of the top 10, I mentioned there could be some serious repercussions. Members of the FBI or the Justice Department could be found in contempt, and then it all of course could be criminal charges if it turns out it was a conspiracy to defraud that court.BARTIROMO: So it's the media leak strategy, the informant strategy, the dossier strategy, and they all came together to just get this information out the into zeitgeist so that we could all talk about it for two years and people could question Donald Trump.SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: Will there be accountability? Lindsey Graham has told me he's going to do a deep dive into this.SOLOMON: Right.BARTIROMO: The A.G is -- apparently knows that they were spying.SOLOMON: Right.BARTIROMO: And he's looking for a predicate. Then you've got the Inspector General also coming out with his report within the month, I heard.SOLOMON: I believe -- yes. I think you're going to get two reports from the Inspector General, one on James Comey, he's handling a classified information, those memos he leaked to his lawyers, maybe to the media subsequently right after that, I think we'll see the fuller report on the FISA abuses. I think that will be the roadmap for whether we have prosecutions, discipline, or a contempt finding before the FISA Court. When all this gets into the public, I think the FISA Court may step in for the first time and say, "Hey, we want to know what you did to us." They've been remarkably silently, but I don't think they can stay silent much longer.BARTIROMO: Well, the FISA judges have to feel like they were -- they were put on. I mean they were totally, you know, hoodwinked.SOLOMON: Yes. You have to think that way. Just looking at the -- how carefully those words were chosen to avoid disclosing the things that were there. It was a very intentional document to avoid the truth.BARTIROMO: With all of this glaring truth that, you know, we saw a long time ago.SOLOMON: Right.BARTIROMO: But now the public is actually seeing it --SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- can the Democrats keep up the charade by saying, "Oh, yes, we want to impeach," and, "Oh, yes, obstruction of justice," and all this stuff.SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: Can they ignore completely the investigation of investigating the investigators?SOLOMON: Well, they may try for a while because they have a lot to hide. They and their -- the complicities news media that they worked with in those leaks and in the stories, they've built the narrative. At the end of the day, there --the power of the Attorney General, the power of the Inspector General, the power of FISA Court is going to force everybody to stand up and take note of what's happening.You can't sweep that under the rug anymore. They have some enormous reach when they make a conclusion or they release stuff. I don't think the dam is going to hold much longer. I think they're going to have to look back and say, "This wasn't a very good investigation. We wrote a really bad storyline." It may take some time, but I think they'll get there.BARTIROMO: Which is why Donald Trump needs to stay away from the Attorney General and not make it look any way, shape or form that he is not independent because he's shown some real independence here.SOLOMON: He clearly has. And I -- listen, the old Donald Trump (INAUDIBLE) what he complained to me in the interview last year was he wanted an Attorney General that was an adult running the department. He has that now, you won't have to worry about what's going on anymore.BARTIROMO: So you think we'll see accountability here?SOLOMON: I do.BARTIROMO: You think we're going to see prosecutions?SOLOMON: I think there's a strong possibility, it really comes down to the evidence of the testimony that get, but there's a strong possibility for prosecution of at least a couple of people.BARTIROMO: And what about people like John Brennan who's going around --SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- with his former CIA director title and saying Donald Trump was treasonous. I mean is there any accountability for that? Or Adam Schiff, who just this weekend --SOLOMON: This weekend.BARTIROMO: -- this week -- he's still holding on, clinging to this collusion.SOLOMON: Pretty remarkable. Yes.BARTIROMO: It's remarkable.SOLOMON: Yes, it is people. Well, I -- people will go back and look at the Schiff sound bites and they will not be held up in the course of history. He'll have been wrong in many of the things he said I think John Brennan may be the most interesting character that we don't know enough about, yet I think the CIA may have played a role in seeding this investigation, setting a breadcrumb trial for the FBI. If that's the case, that's the CIA intervening in domestic politics. He could have a lot to answer for. It's one of the things I know Lindsey Graham is looking at. I think Bill Barr will look at it as well.BARTIROMO: And that's why I think that the left is digging in. They have nowhere to go.SOLOMON: No.BARTIROMO: They've gone -- they've banked on this story --SOLOMON: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- thinking that the American people were going to be stupid and not understand what took place. For so long, there's nowhere to go other than to keep up the lie.SOLOMON: Yes. I think you have to just -- they'll do that for a while but at some point, the doors would come off the house and everyone's going to storm in and we're going to get the final truth that we deserve.BARTIROMO: Will you expect the Inspector General Report next couple of weeks?SOLOMON: I think probably May is what I'm hearing, mid to late 90s, the likely timeframe but you could see a Comey report before then.BARTIROMO: A Comey report before then then.SOLOMON: Yes, that's what I'm hearing.BARTIROMO: And do you think there will be an additional investigation into the Hillary Clinton e-mail mess and the way she was handled by the FBI as well.SOLOMON: There could be some things going on that we don't see. I hear some rumblings in Little Rock, that the Little Rock art -- FBI is doing some stuff there. We don't know what John Huber ever did. I've always thought he's a head fake because I haven't seen much evidence, but I get some rumblings that they're looking on a few things. There's also some litigations, simple litigation working its way through different courts that might bring some accountability to those -- to those issues as well.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. John, it's great to have your insights.SOLOMON: Thank you. Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. We'll be watching and reading your op-eds.SOLOMON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: John Solomon joining us there. Coming up, big Bitcoin loss, the Billionaire founder of SoftBank took $130-million hit on Bitcoin. We've got the story. And then beautiful beaches are not the only doing things driving home buyers to fly Florida, details behind a new bill that may force California's richest residents to pay up in taxes, next up, stay with us.BARTIROMO: OK. Let's talk taxes real, estate taxes. A new tax could be coming to California residents. Individual estates valued at more than $3- 1/2 million would be affected. California already boasts the largest marginal tax rate in the country. Our next guest says saying that that's causing an exodus to lower tax states like Florida. Joining us right now is the Co-Founder and CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, Dolly Lenz, along with the company's Managing Director and Dolly's daughter, Jenny Lenz. Great to see you, ladies. Thank you so much for being here.DOLLY LENZ, CEO, DOLLY LENZ REAL ESTATE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Is this having an impact, this idea that this tax could be coming to California?D. LENZ: No question. We've had so many buyers over the years, because New York has a very high estate tax, and they said, "No, you know what, I'm moving out of New York, I'm moving to California, the weather's perfect, everything is wonderful, no estate tax." And now they're all saying to us, "Oh, gee. Now we're going to have to sell our homes and possibly move to Florida, Nevada, Texas, you know, looking at a few options, but it's not good for California.BARTIROMO: Which is what we're saying on this show is money is mobile.D. LENZ: Yes.BARTIROMO: And money will go where it's treated best. How is New York doing with this millionaire's tax, Jenny?JENNY LENZ, MANAGING DIRECTOR, DOLLY LENZ REAL ESTATE: Well, we're thinking that it's really going to impact, you know, who -- and who's going to want to buy and take responsibility for that tax.BARTIROMO: Yes.J. LENZ: So it's going to be the buyer or seller, but ultimately, like all taxes, they're going to be baked in to the price. So, we think prices are going to come down as a result.FOWLER: So here's a question for you. So I mean I think there is -- so there's tax exodus. How many folks are we talking about here? I mean what's the -- what's the -- what's the landscape?J. LENZ: So about 0.47 percent of people have migrated out of New York, which is the highest of any of the 50 states and --BARTIROMO: That's a big number. Huge, huge.J. LENZ: It is huge. Just like 40,000 I would say.BARTIROMO: Yes.J. LENZ: And most of them, as we're saying, are moving to Florida because it just makes sense, the taxes are so low.MCDOWELL: No state income tax.J. LENZ: No seed income tax.BARTIROMO: Exactly.MCDOWELL: And -- but another thing with New York is if people can -- if you can justify where their tax dollars are going, they might tolerate it.J. LENZ: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: New York City has the problem, that the living conditions for the every man and every woman are appalling.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And are horrible, and so they're not, like, you're not getting anything, you're getting --BARTIROMO: Looking to get worse, right?MCDOWELL: You're getting, like, you know, grotesqueness in the street every time and subways that don't run.D. LENZ: Yes. And for example, we were just in Naples, Florida. We're going back there next week because clients are looking to buy there and we're doing their advance work for them and they told us, "Look, we just raised our income tax -- no, sorry, not our income tax, our sale tax from 0.6 percent to 0.675 percent and that park is being built on that money, your tax dollars at work. They actually think about that. You know, it seems that we don't need to think about anything.BARTIROMO: Yes. And, you know what, Tucker Carlson showed some video last night of California. And you talk about grotesque. I mean you I think L.A. is so, you know, high and -- high and mighty, there are so many homeless people on the streets in L.A. right now. It's a similar situation that you're referring to in New York.MCDOWELL: I just retweeted an excrement map from San Franciscan on Twitter --J. LENZ: Oh, yes.D. LENZ: Oh, yes, that's the one.MCDOWELL: -- if you would like to see it.D. LENZ: But you know what, because it's --BARTIROMO: How horrible.MCDOWELL: It's the report -- it's the number of reports on that in San Fran. It's disgusting.BARTIROMO: Is the market weakening or strengthening right now?D. LENZ: In New York?BARTIROMO: Yes.D. LENZ: Oh, definitely weakening. Yes, unfortunately. Although low interest rates, I think, are going to be seen -- the impact is going to be seen in the coming months.BARTIROMO: All right.D. LENZ: That's a good thing.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Dolly and Jenny Lenz. Great to see you both.D. LENZ: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you, ladies. Coming up, crypto crash, that's next. Stay with us. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The head of Netflix is getting a raise. Cheryl Casone on headlines now. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. Executives Netflix benefiting from a strong company stock performance and the CEO, Reed Hastings, going to collect an annual salary of $700,000 and stock options worth nearly, here we go, $31 million. A little bit of pressure on Netflix in the premarket.Well, a big Bitcoin loss for the founder of SoftBank, Masayoshi Son lost more than $130 million when he sold his position in the digital currency early last year. This is according to a report, front page of the Journal. Bitcoin up three percent right now, but sharply below the all-time high that was pushing $20,000.Well, major credit card companies boosting spending on social media ads. Capital One spending more than $18 million on Facebook ads last year. That is up from just $3 million in 2017. And American Express shelled out $14 million last year. That's up from just a million in 2017. And we're just getting some news that President Trump and the first lady packing their bags for London. According to a statement from Buckingham Palace we just received, the President and Melania have accepted an invitation from Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth, to visit the U.K. from June 3rd to the 5th.Trump also going to meet with British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and attend a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day. And as I toss it back to you, I want to say happy birthday, Queen Elizabeth. She turned 93 yesterday.BARTIROMO: Wow. Fantastic.CASONE: Ninety-three. Can we all get there?BARTIROMO: Big happy birthday. We hope.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, we heard a lot of earnings in this last three hours, and largely they've been better than expected, Lindsey.BELL: They've been significantly better than expected because we saw numbers get slashed going into this reporting period and what's good is you're seeing the stocks actually react and move higher even though we're at a, you know, a premium multiple on the S&P 500 at 17.6 times.BARTIROMO: People overdid it on the downside.BELL: Yes.FOWLER: I agree. I think Lindsey's right. I think you saw it with Twitter, I think you saw it with JetBlue, especially because the entire market was under pressure because of what -- what's happening with Boeing, that JetBlue did pretty well in this -- in this earning period. It's pretty exciting.MCDOWELL: And a thank you to Richard Fowler for telling me to watch "Homecoming," on Netflix, the Beyonce Concert Special from Coachella.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: I cried.FOWLER: It was good?MCDOWELL: I cried.BARTIROMO: You loved it.MCDOWELL: It is that good. It is a --FOWLER: Do you cry over anything, Dagen?BARTIROMO: She doesn't.MCDOWELL: Just --BARTIROMO: She's not a crier.MCDOWELL: Beyonce's hair flip. It kills me every time.FOWLER: She cried because of the hair flip. You heard it -- you heard it --BARTIROMO: Oh, good. So, yes, I'm glad. Now I will watch it as well. When it's Dagen's recommendation, I'm in. Have a great day, everybody. Seize the day. Dagen, Richard, Lindsey, thank you.FOWLER: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Great to see you all. Let's get to Stuart Varney and "VARNEY & CO." Stu, take it away.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: All right. Good morning, Maria.Load-Date: April 23, 2019End of Document

The Institute will revisit collaborations with these entities as circumstances dictate," MIT Vice President for Research Maria Zuber and Associate Provost Richard Lester said in a letter to the university's faculty on Wednesday. The administrators noted that most recently, the university has determined that engagements with certain countries - currently China, Russia and Saudi Arabia - "merit additional faculty and administrative review beyond the usual evaluations" that all international projects receive. MIT noted that projects funded by people or entities from China, including Hong Kong, Russia and Saudi Arabia, projects that involve MIT faculty, staff or students conducting work in these countries, and collaborative projects with people or entities from these countries will be subject to additional review. The U.S. has serious concerns about the security risks posed by Chinese technology companies, including Huawei and ZTE. Intelligence agencies are concerned that Huawei and other Chinese companies may be beholden to the Chinese government or the ruling Communist Party, raising the risk of espionage. A bipartisan resolution introduced in the U.S. Senate in late March has warned that Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE present serious threats to the national security of the U.S. and its allies.        Load-Date: April 4, 2019End of Document

Former Chinese Interpol chief 'admits his crimes' of accepting $2m bribesCNN.comJune 20, 2019 Thursday 2:02 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 277 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: Beijing BodyInterpol's former president Meng Hongwei, who dramatically vanished into police custody after returning to China in 2018, has admitted to corruption charges in a court in Tianjin on Thursday.Meng, who was also China's vice minister of public security, was accused of accepting more than $2 million (14.46 million yuan) from businesses and individuals from 2005 to 2017, according to a statement released by Tianjin No. 1 Intermediate People's Court.In Meng's closing remarks, after arguments from both sides were heard, he "admitted his crimes and expressed repentance," the statement said. The court's verdict and Meng's sentencing will be announced at a later date.Meng disappeared after he left Interpol headquarters in France and took a flight back to China in late September 2018. His wife, Grace, said at the time that the last contact she received from him was a text message saying to wait for his call, followed minutes later by a knife emoji.As his case drew rising global attention, the Chinese government acknowledged in October that Meng had been detained for alleged corruption."(Meng) insisted on taking the wrong path and had only himself to blame (for his downfall)," the country's top law enforcement official, Zhao Kezhi, was quoted as saying in a statement.Shortly after Beijing announced Meng's arrest, Interpol said it had received and accepted his resignation with "immediate effect."Meng was the first Chinese official to lead the international policing body and his appointment three years ago in 2016 was greeted enthusiastically by the country's state media. He retained the title of vice minister of public security while at Interpol.Load-Date: June 22, 2019End of Document

Article 19: Memory and ResistanceTargeted News ServiceJune 6, 2019 Thursday 7:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 913 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON, England BodyArticle 19 issued the following news release:* * *- Anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and why we must protect our right to protest* * *We do not know how many students and activists were killed on June 4, 1989, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army opened fire and drove tanks into protestors occupying Tiananmen Square.Before the onslaught, the passion and courage of thousands of people had been directed towards preparing for the worst. Yet as the New York Times reported on the 21st May 1989, the protestors shared food and drink with the soldiers, and tried to explain to them the reasons why they had taken to the streets. Some soldiers declared they would not touch a hair on the head of a student.While the image of an unidentified man standing in front of the tanks is known around the world, details continue to be revealed of the massacre that took place day. A cable from the British Ambassador to China, Sir Alan Donald, released in 2017, estimated that more than 10,000 protestors were killed.Using state repression and censorship the Chinese Government has tried to erase the memory of those weeks in the spring of 1989. Yet however much the Chinese authorities deploy the sophistication of censorship, and online surveillance, the Guardian has reported that activists within China mark the anniversary of the protest by fasting.We in ARTICLE 19 will never forget theTiananmen Square massacre, nor those who died fighting for their rights, or who dared to question the orders they were given. We join millions of people around the world who stand in solidarity with Chinese activists who continue to work for their rights to freedom and liberty to be respected by their State.Yet we know that remembering Tiananmen Square is not enough. The international community must preserve the dignity of protest and protect the fundamental right to free expression. It must present a true and honest vision to Beijing and other repressive states to enable rather than restrict the participation of citizens in their own domestic affairs.Protecting the right to protestActs of popular protest take many forms. Tiananmen Square is a reminder of how powerful protest is, and how, even in the most repressive and authoritarian regimes, people are still willing to risk their lives to stand up for what they believe in.The suffering of protestors currently in detention without trial in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Bahrain, China and far too many other states, is testament to the threat that public protest presents to repressive regimes. Just this week, it has been reported that over 100 pro-democracy protestors in Khartoum, Sudan were killed by government forces who raped and murdered unarmed civilians in acts of brutality that were solely designed to intimidate and force people off the streets.The right to assemble and demonstrate is essential for participation in civil society. We use indicators that measure protest in our Expression Agenda Report that looks at the state of freedom of expression in over 100 countries around the world. We can all see how the Internet has facilitated a new era of protest: collective action is organised more easily on a global scale, such as the 2017 women's marches and the rapid rise of climate crisis activism. We have also seen how protests create real world change, as in Algeria earlier this year, when demonstrations led President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to announce that he would not be standing for a fifth term.Surveillance and the shift towards authoritarianismHowever the threat to our right to protest and expression is real. Under President Xi Jinping, China has become increasingly authoritarian after an initial period of promising change and reform in the late 1990s. The umbrella protests in Hong Kong this year are evidence that state repression from China has chilled a once vibrant participatory democracy.Today, China has one of the most repressive censorship regimes in the world, and is at the forefront of state surveillance and censorship online. Repressive measures include the well-known ban on the use of anonymous browsing tools, the censorship of search results and the blocking of websites, such as Chinese Wikipedia. More recently, the Chinese Government has ignored international criticism over its brutal crackdown against Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region. It has been reported that up to 1.5 million Uighurs and other Muslims have been interned in camps, where the Government claims they are being 'de-radicalised'. In May, a Human Rights Watch report confirmed that the Chinese police where using a mobile app to surveil and then arbitrarily detain Muslims.As we know China does not have a monopoly on repression. Equally concerning are efforts by a growing number of states to command access to sensitive personal data retained by corporations.Such acts diminish the authority of States because they undermine the rights of their own citizens. As we remember Tiananmen Square, we must also work much harder to understand the threats that surveillance, unaccountable internet shut-downs, and state sponsored fire-walls pose to expression. The role of the state, and especially of progressive states, is to protect and enhance the rights of its citizens, to show the plight of those who suffer because they are denied the same universal freedoms, and never to forget those who have died in the defence of freedoms so many of us enjoy.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6751381 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 7, 2019End of Document

Huawei suggests sales are experiencing U.S. pressure impactCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 11, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 413 wordsBodyThe Chinese telecom giant Huawei announced this Tuesday that it would become the world's largest manufacturer of ' smartphones ' this year, if not for the ' unexpected circumstances ', indicating that the pressure exerted by Washington is damaging the Their sales."If we hadn't encountered unexpected circumstances, we would be number one globally in the fourth quarter," said Shao Yang, responsible for Huawei's strategy at the Consumer Electronics Show in Shanghai."Now, we'll have to wait a little longer," he added, without referring directly to the U.S. president, Donald Trump, or the trade war between Beijing and Washington.Last month, Trump issued an executive order requiring companies in the country to obtain a licence to sell critical technology to Huawei in a scam that could prove fatal to the Chinese firm.The Governments of the United States and China, the two largest economies in the world, have imposed customs duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of imported goods from each other.In question is Beijing's policy for the technology sector, namely the "Made in China 2025" plan, which aims to transform the country's state-owned firms into major global actors in high-value-added sectors, such as artificial intelligence, renewable energy, Robotics and electric cars.The U.S. considers that this plan, driven by the Chinese state, violates China's commitments to open its market, notably by forcing foreign companies to transfer technology and by allocating subsidies to domestic businesses while protecting them of external competition.The Chinese authorities accuse Washington of wanting to restrain China's rise by blocking its major companies, including Huawei.Washington has pushed several countries, including Portugal, to exclude Huawei in building infrastructure for fifth generation (5G) networks, the Internet of the future, accusing the company of being subject to cooperating with Chinese information services.Australia, New Zealand and Japan have already adhered to Washington's appeals and restricted the participation of Huawei.Last year, the Chinese company surpassed Apple and became the second-largest smartphone brand in the world, behind Samsung South Korean, with sales exceeding 20% and settling on 100 billion dollars.Shao assured that the company will advance in the development of its own technology."People look at the 5G issue, but we see beyond that," he said. "Those who are not courageous do not progress, stay behind," he said.Load-Date: June 11, 2019End of Document

Commercial war between USA and China: Huawei caseCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 24, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 518 wordsBody       Since the Second World War, the supremacy of the United States has not been questioned. Today, the Chinese economy has come to destabilize the system. And now that the "evil is done," What do the U.S. do to safeguard its position?Last month, Trump's administration banned U.S. companies from exporting technology to a set of companies considered "risky", including Huawei. The reasons that have motivated this have been alleged to concern the safety of products sold by these companies. But are these the only reasons for the White House? Since the Second World War, the supremacy of the United States has not been questioned. Today, the Chinese economy has come to destabilize the system. The functioning of the international economy has enabled a developing country to become first in the "Factory of the World" and later in its technological hub. And now that the "evil is done," What do the U.S. do to safeguard its position? They start a trade war with China and make life difficult for a group of companies considered "key", particularly Huawei. Huawei, a Chinese nationality, is one of the world's leading telecommunications giants. Its leadership results mainly from the development of 5G networks, having this company signed already contracts with more than 10 countries and various carriers to provide the components for the next generation of mobile internet. The competitors, Nokia and Ericsson, have presented less favorable results due, above all, to the highest price they practice on the market. Recently, in the United States, Huawei has been accused of criminal activities such as bank fraud, industrial property theft and violation of sanctions against Iran. These accusations culminated in the arrest of the group's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, on December 1, 2018. Trump pressed Huawei One last time, on May 17th, by adding the company to the Department of Commerce's "black List". This means that from now on, U.S. companies, such as Google, Qualcomm and Intel, are required by law to obtain a special license to sell products to Huawei. In parallel, the U.S. has made pejorative advertising to Huawei's 5G networks, having advised several countries not to trust this company. This is because, according to them, there is a possibility of Huawei leaving "open doors" in their systems, which can be used to access sensitive information. Effectively, between 2009 and 2011, Vodafone found vulnerabilities in Huawei equipment supplied to the Italian market. However, it was not possible to prove that these vulnerabilities were purposely designed. Still, the United States has protested against the fact that the company has links with the Chinese government, jeopardizing its legitimacy. There is no doubt that the economic future will be delineated by the development of technology, such as 5G. Now, whoever has control of this technology will certainly have an absolute advantage, very rarely broken. Are these U.S. measures an attempt to safeguard the security of our information or will they conceal an interest in delaying Chinese technological advancement? Member of the new Investment ClubLoad-Date: June 24, 2019End of Document

Continue reading FCC chairman moves to block China Mobile from entering the USOn Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said that he opposes a bid from China Mobile to provide telecommunications services in the US. The FCC will vote on the company's application next month.China Mobile filed its application to supply the US with telecom services in September 2011, and after a long review process, the FCC told reporters today that senior officials believed the carrier to pose significant national security and law enforcement risks to the US. Safeguarding our communications networks is critical to our national security. After reviewing the evidence in this proceeding, including the input provided by other federal agencies, it is clear that China Mobile's application to provide telecommunications services in our country raises substantial and serious national security and law enforcement risks,  Pai said in a statement.  Therefore, I do not believe that approving it would be in the public interest. I hope that my colleagues will join me in voting to reject China Mobile's application. Senior FCC officials said that they believed China Mobile to ultimately be owned by the People's Republic of China and, if supported in the US, could lead to Chinese government-led espionage on US consumers. The officials also said that the Commission will not be pursuing a mitigation agreement because of these threats and a lack of trust between both the US and China. China Mobile presented a possible mitigation agreement to the administration, but it was rejected by both the executive branch and the FCC.The move comes amid new and widespread concerns about Chinese telecoms' powers over American networks. In March of last year, Pai announced that the FCC would be considering a new rule that would bar US carriers like AT&T and Verizon from using Universal Service Funds to purchase China-based telecom equipment for their networks. This move to block China Mobile does not affect funding, but senior officials said that the USF rule, which was first floated around last year, is still under consideration.This new rule will receive a vote at the FCC's next open meeting on May 9th. It's unclear how other commissioners plan to vote.Tags:  See Website:            https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18412296/fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-china-mobiles-us-telecom-services-supply-opposesContact Information:Makena KellyTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: April 18, 2019End of Document

Senate Judiciary Committee Issues Testimony From State Deputy Assistant Secretary StrayerTargeted News ServiceMay 14, 2019 Tuesday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1068 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Judiciary Committee issued the following testimony by Robert L. Strayer, deputy assistant secretary of State for cyber and international communications and information policy, at a hearing entitled "5G: National Security Concerns, Intellectual Property Issues, and the Impact on Competition and Innovation":"As the world becomes more interconnected, international cyber policy issues are becoming even more critical to national security, human rights, and economic prosperity. The State Department promotes U.S. foreign policy interests in cyberspace by engaging with our allies and partners to advance our vision for an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure digital environment."The Fifth Generation of wireless technology, or 5G, will be transformative by providing consumers and businesses with up to 100 times faster connections than 4G networks provide, and with very low latency - which is the time devices need to communicate with one another. Tens of billions of new devices will be connected to the Internet in the next few years."These connections will empower a vast array of new critical services - from autonomous vehicles and transportation systems, to telemedicine, to automated manufacturing as well as traditional critical infrastructure, such as electricity distribution. The massive amounts of data transmitted by the Internet of Things devices on 5G networks will also advance artificial intelligence."With all of these services relying on 5G networks, the stakes for safeguarding these vital networks could not be higher."As countries around the world upgrade their communications systems to 5G technology, we are urging them to adopt a risk-based security framework. To this end, the Department is executing a global campaign on 5G security that includes strategic bilateral and multilateral engagements to convince our allies and partners of the seriousness of the need to adequately secure these networks."An important element of this risk-based security approach is a careful evaluation of hardware and software equipment vendors and the supply chain. The evaluation criteria should include the extent to which vendors are subject to control by a foreign government with no meaningful checks and balances on its power to compel cooperation of these vendors with its intelligence and security agencies."For example, because of the essential role that vendors play in networks and their maintenance, they could be ordered to undermine network security--to steal personal information or intellectual property, conduct espionage, disrupt critical services, or conduct cyber attacks."Under Chinese law, most notably its National Intelligence Law, Chinese citizens and organizations are required to cooperate with Chinese intelligence and security services."In addition, the Chinese government does not have any meaningful checks or balances on its powers. As President Xi Jinping told security officials in January, China does not walk the "Western road" of constitutionalism, separation of powers, or judicial independence."Therefore, we are concerned that China could compel actions by network vendors to act against the interests of U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries around the world."Chinese technology firms are already working with authoritarian regimes - often hand-in-hand with the Chinese government - to suppress freedom of expression and other human rights through arbitrary surveillance, censorship, and targeted restrictions on Internet access. If Chinese companies build the underlying 5G infrastructure, they will be in an even better position to facilitate these activities."In addition, China has a long history of undertaking intellectual property theft to benefit its commercial interests. Last December, the United States announced that since at least 2014, Chinese cyber actors associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security hacked multiple U.S. and global managed service and cloud providers. These cyber intrusions allowed China to compromise the networks of the providers' clients, including global companies located in at least 12 countries. Countries should not allow 5G to be another vector for China to steal their intellectual property."Chinese companies, such as Huawei, appear to have benefited from subsidized financing for their equipment sales. Countries should adopt the best practices in procurement, investment, and contracting, and require that financing be commercially reasonable, conducted openly and transparently, and based on free market competitive principles, while taking into account trade obligations."The United States will be a leader in 5G deployment, and we will do so using trusted vendors to build our networks. Through our engagements, many other countries are now acknowledging the supply chain risk and beginning to strengthen their information and communications technology security alongside the United States."For example, in August of last year, Australia issued 5G security guidance to Australian carriers to protect their networks from unauthorized access or interference by "vendors who are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law.""In March, the European Commission released a set of recommendations to improve the cybersecurity of 5G networks, noting that evaluations of equipment suppliers should include the "risk of influence by a third country, notably in relation to its model of governance." This principle should be applied rigorously."Two weeks ago, the Czech Republic hosted more than 140 representatives of 32 countries from around the world, as well as the European Union and NATO, to build consensus on a common approach to 5G security. This effort produced the Prague Proposals -- a set of recommendations on how to build secure and resilient 5G networks based on free and fair competition, transparency, and the rule of law. Moving forward, the Prague Proposals will help guide our engagements with our partners and allies to build secure 5G networks."We will continue our bilateral and multilateral engagements to ensure that telecommunications, the Internet, and all the critical services that 5G will enable are secure and reliable."Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee today, and I look forward to your questions."[TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6729291 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 15, 2019End of Document

Trump: Huawei Poses National Security ThreatThe FrontrunnerJune 11, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 415 wordsBodyAsked in a phone interview on CNBC's Squawk Box (6/10, 145K) if he sees Huawei as a national security threat, President Trump said, "I do see it as a threat. At the same time, it could be very well that we do something with respect to Huawei as part of our trade negotiations with China."Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who said in a separate interview with CNBC (6/10, 94K), "As we've said all along, the Huawei discussions are really national security discussions. They separate from trade. Both we and China have acknowledged that in our discussions. Now, of course, President Trump, when he has the meeting, to the extent he gets certain comfort on Huawei or other issues, obviously we can talk about national security issues, but these are separate issues. They're not being linked to trade."Vice President Pence said in an interview with Fox News' Special Report (6/10, 1.53M), "The position of the United States of America is that Huawei, which the Communist Party of China and their government have complete access to - all of the data that they collect - represents a fundamental compromise of our national security and of the national security of our allies, and we'll continue to stand firm in that regard."Huawei Defends Practices Before British Parliament.The New York Times (6/10, Satariano, 18.61M) reports that a Huawei executive "defended the company's security practices in the face of tough questioning from members of the British Parliament on Monday." John Suffolk, Huawei's "global cybersecurity and privacy officer, appeared at a hearing in the House of Commons about the safety of Britain's telecommunications infrastructure" and insisted that the company is "independent and would never undermine the safety of its equipment to satisfy demands from Beijing." Said Suffolk, "There are no laws in China that obligate us to work with the Chinese government. There is no requirement."Some Tech Firms Cut Employee Access To Huawei.Reuters (6/10, Dave, Prentice) reports exclusively that "some of the world's biggest tech companies have told their employees to stop talking about technology and technical standards with counterparts at Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in response to the recent US blacklisting of the Chinese tech firm, according to people familiar with the matter." Intel and Qualcomm, as well as mobile research firm InterDigital Wireless Inc and South Korean carrier LG Uplus, have "restricted employees from informal conversations with Huawei," the sources said.Load-Date: June 11, 2019End of Document

They protesters were forcibly dispersed by police using tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets. They did not assemble again on Thursday and debate over the legislation was delayed.Telegram CEO Pavel Durov tweeted that most of the attackers had IP addresses from China."Historically, all state actor-sized (attacks) we experienced coincided in time with protests in Hong Kong," Durov said. "This case was not an exception."Activists in both Hong Kong and mainland China often use Telegram to organize protests in hopes the encryption will allow them to evade the government surveillance of Chinese social networking apps such as WeChat.Whereas WeChat users reported this week that photos of the protests could not be viewed, apps like Telegram offer more privacy and independence. Telegram is blocked in mainland China, but users can access it using software to circumvent the firewall, which also blocks apps and websites ranging from Facebook to The New York Times.Encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram say that messages sent on their systems cannot be decoded by third parties during the delivery from sender to recipient. "We can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression," Telegram says on its website.Telegram said that the latest attack was a distributed denial of service in which "your servers get GADZILLIONS of garbage requests which stop them from processing legitimate requests."The messaging app said on Wednesday evening that the system had stabilized.The protest in Hong Kong forced the legislature to cancel its sessions Wednesday and Thursday, putting off debate on the extradition legislation.Opponents say the bill would severely compromise their freedoms and erode Hong Kong's legal independence. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam maintains the legislation is necessary and would have safeguards to ensure human rights are protected.Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, enjoys greater freedoms than mainland China under a "one country, two systems" framework put in place when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997. Hong Kong residents can freely surf the Internet and participate in public protests, unlike in the mainland.The U.S. government has complained for years about data breaches by China to steal high-tech information and other trade secrets - a key factor in the current trade dispute between China and the United States. Pentagon leaders told a congressional committee this month that cyberattacks from China are increasingly sophisticated.When asked about the Telegram issue at a daily news briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he was not aware of the case but that "China always opposes any form of cyberattack.""China is also a victim of cyberattacks," Geng said.Load-Date: June 14, 2019End of Document

Samsung to gain from Huawei's losses in US-China trade warStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeMay 28, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 343 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyKang made the remarks at a press briefing on Monday in response to US President Donald Trump's recent remarks, Xinhua reported.Furthermore, given how China has been blocking Google-made apps and cloud software for many years now, the US ban will have no effect on Huawei's operations in its home country, the handset maker confirmed.When asked about a possible retaliation against the U.S.by China banning Apple, Ren Zhengfei said he was looking up to Apple as a teacher, leader, and mentor, without which there would be a different world, without internet. "Second of all, if that happens, I'll be the first to protest", he told Bloomberg.The latest round of Sino-US trade talks stalled last Friday, but the sides pledged to continue working toward a trade agreement in order to solve the bilateral trade dispute which has been simmering since June 2018, when Trump slapped hefty tariffs on Chinese goods in a move that prompted Beijing to retaliate. A recent clip from the popular comedy tv show discussing Chinese equipment makerHuawei's dominance in 5G mobile technology ran on Chinese state broadcaster CCTV's national lunchtime news on Monday as part of a package of stories attacking the USA position in the ongoing trade war. "How are we related to China-US trade?" he noted.

'AT LEAST ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE CAMPS FULL TIME': DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY SCOTT BUSBYStates News ServiceMay 15, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1283 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Scott Busby, deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor at the U.S. Department of State, recently spoke with RFA's Uyghur Service about persecution under Chinese rule in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), where authorities have held an estimated 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas in a network of political "re-education camps" since April 2017.During an interview with Mamatjan Juma at the State Department in Washington, Busby discussed inconsistencies in the way China has represented the camp system, what the U.S. has done to raise awareness of the situation in the XUAR, and why other countries have failed to speak out against or even defended China's policies in the region. He also pledged continued U.S. support for the Uyghurs, saying that Washington will exert pressure on China for as long as people are being detained in the camps because of their ethnic background, and religious and cultural traditions.RFA: What kind of concrete action has been taken to close [the camps] or release the detainees from the camps in China?Busby: One of the things we've spent a lot of time on is trying to get the word out about what's happening in Xinjiang. We have been sharing information with many other governments around the world, we've been doing public events talking about Xinjiang. We hostedalong with several other governmentsa side event in Geneva, Switzerland on the margins of the U.N. Human Rights Council specifically devoted to the issue of the abuses taking place in Xinjiang ... Secretary Pompeo, as you know, has met with several Uyghur individuals to hear about their experiences or the experience of their loved ones in the camps. So we have been focused, primarily to date, on getting the word out about the situation in Xinjiang, and I think the world now knows how horrible the situation is. There are other measures that we're considering, but I can't get into the details of the internal deliberations of the U.S. government at this point.Your browser does not support HTML5 video.RFA: The definition of these facilitiessome international human rights organizations and some observers are saying that these are concentration camps. Some researchers would say that these are internment camps. And Chinese is saying that these are vocational training centers. So in your view, what kind of facilities are they?Busby: Clearly, they are not vocational training centers, as China says they are. There are many, many highly educated people in these camps, highly accomplished people in these camps, and that belies China's own description of the camps. I don't really want to get into what we should call them, but I will say we know that over a million people are in these camps, they are held there against their will, some of them are subject to torture, some of them are subject to cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment. We know that some people have died in the camps. So, clearly, what's happening in the camps is horrific. And I should point out that, unfortunately, what's occurring in Xinjiang is consistent with the history of what the Chinese Communist Party has done since it has taken power. The Chinese Communist Party has shown extreme hostility towards all religion since it took power, and that continues to be of great concern to us.Your browser does not support HTML5 video.RFA: Has the United States sought access to those facilitiesnot the [Chinese government] organized [tours], but [independently] to see for themselves what is happening there?Busby: We have asked for access on a number of occasions. While some of our diplomats have been able to travel to Xinjiang, we have not been given access to the facilities ... We have also asked that China provide access to U.N. officials and to other like-minded governments, like our own, to have access to the camps, but so far that hasn't been possible.RFA: In your testimony, you said that there are 800,000 to two million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities detained in the camps. Has there been any change in this estimate, which you mentioned last November?Busby: Our current best estimate is that there are at least one million people in the camps full time. There are a number of additional people who are required to go to some of these camps or to go to other facilities for a portion of their day. But our understanding, currently, is that there are at least one million people in the camps, and possibly more.Your browser does not support HTML5 video.Challenging ChinaRFA: Why is China getting away with such horrendous abuses? If over one million people of a certain ethnicity were detained in other countries, there would have been very strong criticism around the world.Busby: Many other countries haven't spoken out and, in some cases, have actually defended the existence of these camps. We think this is a reflection of the power, unfortunately, that China exerts over other countries by virtue of the assistance that China is providing, by virtue of business relationships that China has. So I think a lot of countries are afraid of speaking the truth about what is going on in Xinjiang.RFA: When is this [mass incarceration] going to stop?Busby: It's hard to know. As I said, there have been a few people who have been released from the camps. In a few cases, people have been allowed to leave the country, so there are some cases in which we've succeeded, I think, in helping them to get out of detention. And we will continue to press the Chinese on the individual cases of the family members of the RFA journalists and on other individual cases where we're aware that relatives of people here in the United States are being held in the camps.RFA: If a trade agreement between the United States and China is signed, will the U.S. government continue to push the Chinese to close the camps and release all the detainees?Busby: We will continue to raise this issue so long as there are people being unjustly held in these camps, so long as the camps exist, and so long as people are being mistreated in the way they are being mistreated. You saw that when Secretary Pompeo spoke upon the release of our human rights reports. We will continue to report on these issues in the human rights reports, and we'll continue to raise them with China at every opportunity.RFA: Some are saying that China is carrying out ethnic cleansing or cultural genocide. Some even say that China is committing crimes against humanity. In your own view, how do you define what China is doing to the Uyghur people?Busby: China appears to be intent on robbing the Uyghur people of their ethnicity, of their religion, and that's a horrible, horrible thing. And unfortunately it's consistent with some of the things the Chinese Communist Party has done since it took power in 1949, and we will continue to raise the alarm about these horrible actions they've taken.Your browser does not support HTML5 video.RFA: Uyghur people see the United States as a beacon of hope and they believe the United States is the only country that can help them in this dire situation ... What kind of message do you have for the Uyghur people?Busby: The United States' government and the United States' people will continue to stand by the Uyghur people. We're very, very concerned about what's happening to Uyghur right now, and we will continue to raise our concerns publicly and privately. We will do all that we can to demonstrate our support for the Uyghur people.Reported by Mamatjan Juma for RFA's Uyghur Service.Load-Date: May 15, 2019End of Document

Flagging confidence on the part of businesses and consumers alike, if it is sustained, is an adverse development for the growth outlook.May New Home Sales 626K vs Briefing.com consensus of 683K; April was revised to 679K from 673 The key takeaway from the report is that demand was relatively soft despite a drop in mortgage rates and a 2.8% yr/yr decline in the median sales price of $308,000.Upcoming Economic Data:Weekly MBA Mortgage Applications due out Wednesday at 7:00 (Last Week was -3.4%) May Durable Orders due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of -0.3%; April was -2.1%) May Durable Orders -- Ex Transportation due out Wednesday at 8:30 (Briefing.com consensus of 0.1%; April was 0.0%) May Advance International Trade in Goods due out Wednesday at 8:30 (April was -$72.1 bln) May Advance Retail Inventories due out Wednesday at 8:30 (April was 0.5%) May Advance Wholesale Inventories due out Wednesday at 8:30 (April was 0.7%)Upcoming Fed/Treasury Events:Fed Chair Jerome Powell to speak today at 13:00 ET.Fed's Bostric to speak today at 13:00 ET.Fed's Bullard to speak today at 17:30 ET.The Treasury is scheduled to auction off new debt this week.Tuesday: $40 bln in 2 Year Treasury NotesWednesday: $41 bln in 5 Year Treasury NotesThursday: $32 bln in 7 Year Treasury NotesOther International Events of InterestChinese press reported that local government bond issuance could hit a record high in June due to continued stimulus.10:17OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:BHC Jul 24 calls are seeing interest with 4420 contracts trading vs. open int of 100, pushing implied vol up around 16 points to ~52%.

This isn't altogether surprising given the lack of conviction seen in the futures market ahead of the open.At the same time, it isn't all that surprising given that market participants are spying a 1:00 p.m. ET speaking appearance by Fed Chair Powell as a potential market mover and given that the highly-anticipated G-20 summit is sitting on the weekend horizon.Just not much conviction right now on the part of buyers, who have been very active throughout the month of June, which is on track to be the best June for the S&P 500 since 1955!The broader market will be excused, then, for taking a little time to consolidate after a big run. Some disappointing consumer confidence data for June (121.5 vs. 132.0 Briefing.com consensus) and weaker-than-expected new home sales data for May (626K vs. 683K Briefing.com consensus) have also cast a pall on buying efforts.Treasuries, on the other hand, have benefited from the disappointing data.

Some disappointing consumer confidence data for June (121.5 vs. 132.0 Briefing.com consensus) and weaker-than-expected new home sales data for May (626K vs. 683K Briefing.com consensus) have also cast a pall on buying efforts.Treasuries, on the other hand, have benefited from the disappointing data.

There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30 ET. Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $0.76 (-4% yr/yr) on revenue of $4.24 bln (+8.8% yr/yr). The company is expected to guide for FY20 where consensus stands at $3.31 (-4.8% yr/yr) and $17.3 bln for revenues (+1.6% yr/yr).Looking back, the company beat on EPS four times in a row, but missed on revenues four times in a row. GIS shares increased 3% following its Q4 results. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, General Mills expects Blue Buffalo's net sales and segment operating profit growth will accelerate meaningfully, driven by significant distribution expansion in the FDM channel. Based on the GIS weekly Jun28 $54 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~6% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $58.00-58.50 area, while support sits near the $49.00-49.50 vicinity.GIS has a market cap of ~$32 bln and trades at ~16x FY20 earnings, a notable discount to the average consumer packaged goods stock at 22x.11:13XPH Pharma is the big winner today after second large M&A deal is announced in as many weeksPharma and biotech stocks are the clear winners in trading this morning.

Shares of Bristol-Myers (BMY 45.68, -3.66, -7.4%) also underperformed amid a host of negative news, one of which included an announcement that its acquisition of Celgene (CELG 93.47, -5.44, -5.5%) will be pushed back to the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020.On a related note, President Trump signed a separate executive order, hitting Iran with new sanctions after it shot down a U.S. military drone last week.

Investors have shown some caution, buying into U.S. Treasuries, in front of an appearance from Fed Chair Powell at the top of the hour.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.9%. The Russell 2000 is up 0.1% after underperforming yesterday.Mr. Powell's position as Fed Chair usually commands the most attention, but the market has taken a leg lower in recent action after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC voter) said a half-point cut in the fed funds rate would be too much. Instead, Mr. Bullard prefers a quarter-point cut.Economic data released today has provided some insight into the housing sector and consumer sentiment that has also disappointed investors. New homes sales declined 7.8% m/m in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 (Briefing.com consensus 683,000), and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 121.5 in June (Briefing.com consensus 132.0).Today's action has been largely risk-off, which is being reflected across losses in nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. Leading today's retreat are the S&P 500 communication services (-1.4%), information technology (-1.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.7%) sectors. The materials (+0.1%) and real estate (+0.02%) sectors cling onto slim gains.Home construction company Lennar (LEN 48.33, -3.13, -6.1%) has also contributed to the cautious sentiment after it issued downside Q3 guidance, discouraging investors after it provided positive quarterly results earlier in the day.Separately, there has been a mega-merger deal in the health care space. Allergan (AGN 164.00, +34.41, +26.6%) confirmed it will be acquired by pharmaceutical company AbbVie (ABBV 66.33, -12.12, -15.5%) for about $63 billion, or $188.24 per share, in cash and stock. With shares of AbbVie currently down over 15%, the deal represents a 37% premium to AGN's closing price on Monday.U.S. Treasuries have advanced, pushing benchmark 10-yr yield down three basis points to 1.99%, as investors remain cautious about the economic outlook. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 96.21.Reviewing today's batch of economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 121.5 in June (Briefing.com consensus 132.0) from a downwardly revised 131.3 (from 134.1) in May. The index is at its lowest level since September 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects growing concern about trade tensions among consumers that had been previously lacking, but which had been showing up in business confidence surveys. Flagging confidence on the part of businesses and consumers alike, if it is sustained, is an adverse development for the growth outlook.New home sales declined 7.8% m/m in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 (Briefing.com consensus 683,000) from an upwardly revised 679,000 (from 673,000) in April.The key takeaway from the report is that demand was relatively soft despite a drop in mortgage rates and a 2.8% yr/yr decline in the median sales price of $308,000.The FHFA Housing Price Index for April increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) following an unrevised 0.1% increase in March. The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for April increased 2.5% as expected after increasing a revised 2.6% in March (from 2.7%).12:48TALKX Market Briefing: Bullard reins in scope of rate-cut expectationsThe stock market has hit an air pocket, moving to its lows for the session, following comments from St. Louis Fed President Bullard (FOMC voter) who said he sees a rate cut coming in July, but that he doesn't think a 50-basis points rate cut is necessary.This remark caused some knee-jerk selling interest, as there has been a growing belief that the Fed will be inclined to cut the target range for the fed funds rate by 50 basis points at its July 30-31 FOMC meeting. The fact that one of the Fed's biggest doves -- if not the biggest -- is seemingly trying to rein in the market's rate-cut hopes has taken some of that rate-cut premium out of stock prices.As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell has a speaking engagement at 1:00 p.m. ET.The Russell 2000 is down 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5%; the S&P 500 is down 0.6%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.12:00MSFT Microsoft hit by profit-taking interest (134.79 -2.99)Shares of Dow component Microsoft (MSFT 134.56, -3.22, -2.3%), which is also the largest stock by market capitalization, are underperforming today. That has to do in large part with how the stock has outperformed since June 3.Entering today, Microsoft was up 15% since June 3 (i.e. the day before Fed Chair Powell said the Fed would act appropriately to sustain the expansion) versus a 7.3% gain for the S&P 500 and a 9.2% gain for the Nasdaq Composite.A 15% move in a stock the size of Microsoft is a massive move and left shares of MSFT 21% above their 200-day moving average. The basis for today's selling, then, is a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.That condition was brought to light today by the analyst at Jefferies who raised his price target to $90 from $80, but maintained an Underperform rating and called the stock "materially overvalued."It won't be lost on investors that MSFT has defied the Jefferies view of the stock's prospects in a big way leading into today; nonetheless, with the broader market in a consolidation mode in front of the G-20 summit, the Jefferies view today looks to have served as another profit-taking catalyst.11:45SUMRX European Markets Update: DAX -0.27%, FTSE +0.13%, CAC -0.05%---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.03%Germany's DAX: -0.27%U.K.'s FTSE 100: +0.13%France's CAC 40: -0.05%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.73%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.24%11:41SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Xencor (XNCR) rises on addition to S&P SmallCap 600 index -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersXNCR (38.25 +12.92%): Co will take the place of HFF Inc.

There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30 ET. Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $0.76 (-4% yr/yr) on revenue of $4.24 bln (+8.8% yr/yr). The company is expected to guide for FY20 where consensus stands at $3.31 (-4.8% yr/yr) and $17.3 bln for revenues (+1.6% yr/yr).Looking back, the company beat on EPS four times in a row, but missed on revenues four times in a row. GIS shares increased 3% following its Q4 results. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, General Mills expects Blue Buffalo's net sales and segment operating profit growth will accelerate meaningfully, driven by significant distribution expansion in the FDM channel. Based on the GIS weekly Jun28 $54 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~6% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $58.00-58.50 area, while support sits near the $49.00-49.50 vicinity.GIS has a market cap of ~$32 bln and trades at ~16x FY20 earnings, a notable discount to the average consumer packaged goods stock at 22x.11:13XPH Pharma is the big winner today after second large M&A deal is announced in as many weeksPharma and biotech stocks are the clear winners in trading this morning.

What's notable is that both acquiring companies have blockbuster drugs (ABBV with Humira and PFE with Lyrica) that are soon facing patent expirations. It's clear large pharmas want to restock their portfolios. It's leading to speculation as to which companies may be next.On the other side of the spectrum, China, IT and gold stocks are showing weakness today.10:35SUMRX Morning Commodities: Oil sheds gains, now modestly lower, gold over 1% higherCommodities are higher (+0.5% at 79.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is slightly lower (-0.04% at 95.9420)Looking at energy:Jul WTI crude oil futures are now -$0.08 (-0.1%) at $57.82/barrelIn other energy, Jul natural gas is -$0.4 (-1.9%) at $2.24/MMBtu Moving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$18.15 (+1.3%) at $1436.35/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.05 at $15.43/ozJul copper is now +$0.03 (+1.0%) at 2.73/lb10:31SUMRX Economic Summary: Consumer Confidence & New Home Sales miss expectationsEconomic Data Summary:April Case Schiller Home Price Index 0.4% vs Briefing.com consensus of 2.5%; March was 2.7% April FHFA Housing Price Index 2.5% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.2%; March was revised to 2.6% from 0.1% June Consumer Confidence 121.5 vs Briefing.com consensus of 132.0; May was revised to 131.3 from 134.1The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects growing concern about trade tensions among consumers that had been previously lacking, but which had been showing up in business confidence surveys.

Some disappointing consumer confidence data for June (121.5 vs. 132.0 Briefing.com consensus) and weaker-than-expected new home sales data for May (626K vs. 683K Briefing.com consensus) have also cast a pall on buying efforts.Treasuries, on the other hand, have benefited from the disappointing data.

The Shanghai gave up 0.9% that seemed more like profit taking after last week's run higher. There were also reports that President Trump talked down expectations for the G-20 summit. Japanese shares lost ground following media reports that President Trump is mulling a revamp of the long standing peace treaty with Japan, suggesting the state pick up more slack for its defense. Automotive and Export stocks saw weakness with names such as Toyota and Sony both losing 1% on the day. European bourses are doing very little this morning, under very slight pressure in correspondence with the US and Asia.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -1.010 yr Note: 2.02%USD/JPY: 107.09 -0.21EUR/USD: 1.1383 -0.0016Europe: FTSE -0.2% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.1%Asia: Hang Seng -1.2% Shanghai -0.9% Nikkei -0.4%Gold (1432.90 +14.70) Silver (15.45 +0.07) Crude (57.91 +0.01)17:44FBK FB Financial to sell its Correspondent Lending channel to Rushmore Loan Management Services; expects the transaction to close early Q3 (35.08 -0.07)In addition to the $1.1 million restructuring expense reported for the first quarter of 2019, FB Financial expects to record additional restructuring charges of up to $1.5 million to cover transaction related expenses, severance and other items related to its mortgage operations.

The operators, meanwhile, are signing deals with tech suppliers for the new gear needed to run 5G internet.A 2018 U.S. law bars Huawei, the biggest global maker of network equipment that enjoys a lead in 5G technology, from selling telecoms equipment to U.S. government agencies and contractors.The Trump administration says the company can be legally compelled to spy on behalf of the Chinese government and is therefore a threat to international cybersecurity. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Huawei in May amid an escalating trade war and as the two powers struggle for long-term technological and economic dominance."We've been clear: our ask is that our allies and our partners and our friends don't do anything that will endanger our shared security interests or restrict our ability to share sensitive information," Pompeo said. "Friends speak to each other quite honestly and we had the opportunity to do that today."Blok said that the Netherlands shares U.S. concerns, but has not yet decided on the rules for its 5G auction, expected later this year."There is a specialist committee working now to decide on what criteria to add to the 5G auction and somewhere this summer those criteria will be published," Blok said.Pompeo's brief stop in The Hague is the third leg of a four-nation tour of Europe in which he is both trying to calm nerves over rising U.S.-Iran tensions and stressing that America will defend itself and not relent in raising pressure on the Islamic Republic with economic sanctions.On Sunday in Switzerland, Pompeo said the Trump administration is ready for unconditional discussions with Iran to ease tensions that have sparked fears of conflict.The United States has long accused Iran of destabilizing the Mideast region.Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Cease-fire in US-China trade war doesn't bridge differencesAssociated Press Financial WireJune 30, 2019 Sunday 11:30 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1140 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Once again, Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping have hit the reset button in trade talks between the world's two biggest economies, at least delaying an escalation in tension between the U.S. and China that had financial markets on edge and cast a cloud over the global economy.But when U.S. and Chinese negotiators sit down to work out details, the same difficult task remains: getting China to convince the United States that it will curb its aggressive push to challenge American technological dominance - and then to live up to its promises.At the Group of 20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, Trump and Xi agreed to a cease-fire in the trade conflict . Trump said Saturday he would hold off for the "time being" on plans to impose tariffs on $300 billion more in Chinese imports - on top of the $250 billion he's already targeted. This decision will jump-start trade talks that stalled last month."We're going to work with China where we left off," Trump said Saturday. He also said China had agreed to buy more American farm products.Andy Rothman, an investment strategist with Matthews Asia and a former economic official with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said the Trump-Xi meeting was more conciliatory than he expected. He was struck by Trump's use of the term "strategic partner" to describe U.S. relations with China after other administration officials have played up the geopolitical rivalry between the two countries.Addressing another contentious issue, Trump said he will now allow U.S. companies to sell some components to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, which last month was put on an American blacklist as a threat to national security. Trump said that Huawei will stay on the blacklist, however, and that its future won't be decided until the end of the trade talks.Neil Shearing, London-based chief economist at Capital Economics, predicted that financial markets will rally with relief when they reopen Monday. "But I don't think this marks the turning of the tide," he said. "Talks will ebb and flow, but the direction over the next 12 months will be toward renewed escalation because issues around industrial strategy will prove to be so intractable."The Trump administration says China is trying to cheat its way to dominance in the cutting-edge technologies of the future such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.In a report last year, the Office of the United States Trade Representative accused Beijing of resorting to predatory tactics to challenge American technological supremacy.These include forcing foreign companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market; subsidizing its own companies (especially those owned by the state) while burying foreign firms in regulations; providing government money so Chinese firms can buy sensitive foreign technology at above-market prices; and stealing trade secrets outright.Eleven rounds of talks failed to end the standoff. The United States has imposed 25% import taxes on $250 billion in Chinese products and threatened to target $300 billion more - a move that would extend the tariffs to virtually everything China ships to the United States.China has lashed back with tariffs on $110 billion in American goods, focusing on agricultural products in a direct and painful shot at Trump supporters in the U.S. farm belt.The last time Trump and Xi met - in early December at a G-20 gathering in Buenos Aires, Argentina - they also reached a cease-fire that injected new life into the talks. But the momentum didn't last.Until May, it appeared that the two countries were slowly closing in on a deal. But then U.S. officials accused their Chinese counterparts of reneging on commitments they'd made earlier, and talks broke down.Getting them back on track could prove difficult. Beijing is reluctant to end subsidies to Chinese companies and to write any commitments into Chinese law. The Chinese also want the United States to drop its tariffs as a condition of any deal. But the Trump administration insists on keeping tariffs to use as leverage to make sure that China keeps its promises.For now, business groups are relieved that the tariffs aren't expanding and optimistic the two countries can reach a deal."We are encouraged that China and the United States have agreed to continue negotiations without further escalation of the mutually damaging trade war," said Jason Oxman, president of the Information Technology Industry Council. "We are also relieved that President Trump has reconsidered his threat to impose additional tariffs, which would have accelerated harm to all American consumers, workers, and businesses of all sizes."Still, the decision to go easy on Huawei drew immediate fire politically. "Huawei is one of few potent levers we have to make China play fair on trade," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. "If President Trump backs off, as it appears he is doing, it will dramatically undercut our ability to change China's unfair trades practices."The Commerce Department put the firm on a blacklist because of the possibility its equipment could be used for cyberespionage. Trump suggested that his administration will review the company's status on Commerce's so-called Entity List and cleared the way for U.S. firms to sell it some components.Both countries have economic and political incentives to reach a deal. Xi is overseeing a decelerating economy and likely won't want to be engaged in a destructive trade war when China's ruling Communist Party meets in October. Trump, too, is confronted with an economy that, though still healthy, has looked a bit wobbly. And the trade hostilities with China have hurt his supporters in rural America as he campaigns for re-election in 2020."This is a truce for now - for Xi, ahead of the Communist Party celebrations in October and for Trump, dependent on how his re-election campaign progresses," said Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Enodo Economics. "But as we've said before, fundamentally, this dispute is about much more than trade - it's part of a longer-term Great Decoupling that stems from a conflict over technological supremacy and geopolitical power. This is about redefining the world political and economic order, a process that will see periods of relative calm and also periods of significant turbulence.""Both Chinese and U.S. leaders recognize the importance of bringing the relations back to the right track," said Li Yong of the China Association of International Trade. "President Xi said we hoped to see normal relations. It's hard to predict what will happen tomorrow, so I cannot say when the relations will return to right track."___Chan reported from London___Associated Press journalists Josh Boak in Washington and Joe McDonald, Fu Ting and Sam McNeil in Beijing contributed to this report.Load-Date: July 1, 2019End of Document

Cease-fire in US-China trade war doesn't bridge differencesAssociated Press InternationalJune 30, 2019 Sunday 11:30 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1140 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Once again, Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping have hit the reset button in trade talks between the world's two biggest economies, at least delaying an escalation in tension between the U.S. and China that had financial markets on edge and cast a cloud over the global economy.But when U.S. and Chinese negotiators sit down to work out details, the same difficult task remains: getting China to convince the United States that it will curb its aggressive push to challenge American technological dominance - and then to live up to its promises.At the Group of 20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, Trump and Xi agreed to a cease-fire in the trade conflict . Trump said Saturday he would hold off for the "time being" on plans to impose tariffs on $300 billion more in Chinese imports - on top of the $250 billion he's already targeted. This decision will jump-start trade talks that stalled last month."We're going to work with China where we left off," Trump said Saturday. He also said China had agreed to buy more American farm products.Andy Rothman, an investment strategist with Matthews Asia and a former economic official with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said the Trump-Xi meeting was more conciliatory than he expected. He was struck by Trump's use of the term "strategic partner" to describe U.S. relations with China after other administration officials have played up the geopolitical rivalry between the two countries.Addressing another contentious issue, Trump said he will now allow U.S. companies to sell some components to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, which last month was put on an American blacklist as a threat to national security. Trump said that Huawei will stay on the blacklist, however, and that its future won't be decided until the end of the trade talks.Neil Shearing, London-based chief economist at Capital Economics, predicted that financial markets will rally with relief when they reopen Monday. "But I don't think this marks the turning of the tide," he said.

International Federation of Journalists: Concerns for Chinese Journalist Arrested in AprilTargeted News ServiceMay 28, 2019 Tuesday 8:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 322 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:Beijing-based citizen journalist Xie Qiang was arrested on April 27 for 'picking quarrels and stirring up trouble' and has not been heard from since. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) raises serious concerns about Xie's wellbeing and whereabouts and call on the authorities to immediately confirm his location and grant his family access.Xie Qiang, who uses the pen name Ma Xiao has been immunicado since April 27. According to Radio Free Asia, he received a phone call from police and has not been seen since. On May 4, his family received a notice confirming Xie had been arrested under the deliberately vague charge of 'picking quarrels and stirring up trouble'.Xie was a contributor to the US-based website Chinese Human Rights Defenders and has published a series of interviews with political prisoners on citizen-journalism website Boxun News since 2013. He is also a signatory of 08 Charter, which was initiated by Liu Xiaobo, the late Chinese human rights activist. Xie himself was previously detained for a short period in 2012, a few days before the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.The IFJ said: "We are extremely concerned about the arrest of Xie Qiang. One's freedom should not be restricted just because of what he has written, the opinion he expressed, or during the 'sensitive' times like the anniversary of Tiananmen Massacre. The Chinese government should ensure the freedom of expression and freedom of individuals. For those who are arrested, their rights to fair trial should be ensured - he should be notified with their charge, be able to contact the lawyer of their choice and his family." The condition of immunicado raised the concern that Xie may be subject to torture during these days. IFJ would call for the immediate release of Xie."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6742704 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 29, 2019End of Document

Mar-a-Lago arrest is alarmingThe Tartan: Carnegie Mellon UniversityApril 21, 2019 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: FORUM FORUM; Pg. 1Length: 841 wordsByline: Frank HuBodyOn March 30, 32-year-old Yujing Zhang was arrested by Secret Service agents after lying to enter Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. At the time of the arrest, she was found to have four cell phones, an external hard drive, a malware-infested thumb drive, and two Chinese passports. A later search of her hotel room at the Colony Hotel also revealed nine USB drives, five SIM cards, and $8,000, as reported by The New York Times.While the attempted infiltration brings to light Mar-a-Lago's security concerns, it's hardly surprising that there are spies mingling amidst the resort's ensemble of wealthy patrons. Since President Trump chooses to spend time at his resort rather than the significantly more secure Camp David, Mar-a-Lago has become a high-target location, one which every foreign intelligence service has set their sights on. Espionage is commonplace, though it is rare - and hilarious - for someone to mess it up as badly as Zhang.This incident only fuels the present concerns over the impact that foreign intelligence has on our nation, with specific focus on countries like Russia and China. We have all heard plenty about Russian interference in the 2016 election, a topic that's been dominating news cycles since the beginning of the Trump presidency (and one which we get to read all about in the released, heavily redacted version of the Muller report), but there has not been a lot of focus on China beyond the ongoing trade war. Although security and intelligence officials are finally beginning to look beyond Russia, China, one of America's greatest competitors, deserves far more scrutiny and attention.Although Zhang plays to our stereotypes of what we expect from spies, 21st-century espionage is far more subtle. For example, although it will never be outright acknowledged as spying, the influencing operations of overseas Chinese student organizations is well documented and are considered projections of the goals of the Chinese Communist Party. Such organizations have a long track record, and the U.S. is aware of such activities: nearly 30 Chinese academics and policy experts have had their U.S. visas cancelled in the last year, showing that America is adopting a more stringent admittance policy for Chinese internationals. Of course, that's not to say every traveler arriving from China should be treated with suspicion under the presumption of working for foreign intelligence, as that would be outright discriminatory and wrong. Rather, there should be greater care when approving U.S. visas to ensure those with malicious intentions do not get the chance to cause damage.Human-mediated influencing operations, however, are quickly becoming the least of our concerns in terms of the threat that China poses. Through great investments in their technological capabilities, China is on the verge of becoming a full-blown surveillance state, leveraging its new 5G and telecommunications technology to spy on its own citizens. The process is straightforward and terrifying: cameras track your interactions in the real world, and private companies comb through this data, along with your social media and online shopping history, to provide you with a "citizen score," quantifying your trustworthiness and value to the Chinese government. This dystopian future is something straight out of Black Mirror and reflects the Chinese government's focus on maintaining social order and control.China spying on its own citizens is one thing, but it's more disturbing when they attempt to proliferate beyond their nation. For instance, China has continued its investments in all areas of Africa's infrastructure, pledging $60 billion during the Forum on China Africa Cooperation in Sept. 2018. While the promise is that the assistance comes with no strings attached, many see this move as a new form of colonialism through capital with dangerous consequences. If this continues, we may see Africa become infected with surveillance state technology, only adding to the reach of China's data gathering apparatus. Perhaps China could continue this strategy of targeted investment for other developing and vulnerable countries, leading to slow but sure global domination. We've seen the attempted spread of communism during the Cold War, and it's clear that such intentions are far from gone. History has repeated itself, this time via technological development and the language of capital rather than the rhetoric of revolution.Competition between China and America continues to escalate, and it's clear that both sides are seeking a competitive advantage. Whether that's in the form of vital foreign intelligence or technological superiority, we have to realize that focusing solely on domestic issues will not suffice in a globalized world. Though I dislike many of Trump's policy initiatives, I do agree with the idea of taking a more forceful stance towards China, if not with this administration's approach: if we are to prosper, we have to be aware of what our adversaries are doing and seek to beat them at every turn.Load-Date: April 21, 2019End of Document

The technological cold warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 6, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 550 wordsBody China and the United States have innovative leadership, and among them is the 21st century's strongest talent competition.  In the commercial war, these two economies put on the strategy board the creative talent and productivity of their leading technology companies.  In addition to the trade war that already exists between the United States and China, with a strong tariff flag, now appears a cold technological war. It is the domain of cybernetic capabilities, artificial intelligence, aeronautics and other cutting-edge technologies.  Both countries represent the greatest force in the process of technological creation. They are the ones with the innovative leadership, so there is the strongest competition for the talent of the 21st century. They are technological giants that renew themselves and absorb intelligence regardless of their location.  The economic result of this evolution is productivity. Several studies of international organizations warn that the companies that have taken advantage of digital technologies are those that present the highest productivity in the world. It is a sign of privilege.  At the country level, in the 1980s it was said that those who did not computerize would be the underdeveloped of the future. And there was reason in that premonition. The United States and China are in strong competition showing their aces, such as the creative talent and productivity of leading companies.  The conflict between the two countries was highlighted by the decision of the United States to ban the Chinese company Huawei from obtaining American technology, as well as the possibility of extending this veto to other Chinese technology companies.  Faced with this decision, the Chinese government has recognized that it needs to achieve technological self-sufficiency to avoid relying on the United States for the innovative phase. The president of China, Xi Jinping, said it in the following terms: "Technological innovation is the source of life for companies (....) only if we own our key intellectual and technological property can we produce highly competitive goods. and not be defeated in an increasingly intense competition. "  The Chinese government also prepares reprisals, such as reducing the supply of raw materials that are technological inputs for the United States and where China is the world's leading producer.  The decisions of the Trump government, both in the commercial and technological fields, constitute a destabilizing factor in international relations. Tension covers many sectors besides those cited, which complicates the world economic growth.  In China, an attitude that has epic profiles has already emerged on the part of the government. The president addresses the population, warning about the proximity of difficult times before which the population has to prepare.  For the time being, the Chinese government consolidates its industrial policy, which includes the granting of subsidies, the strengthening of state enterprises and the purchase of industrial property to overcome the technological knowledge of the West. Thus, it articulates facing challenges.  In China, politics and economics are run by the State, which means that it can mobilize its research institutions to pursue a technological career.  [email protected] Load-Date: June 6, 2019End of Document

Baidu posts its first loss in 15 years as China's slowdown hits online advertisingCNN WireMay 17, 2019 Friday 9:24 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 326 wordsByline: By Rishi Iyengar, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China's economic slowdown is taking its toll on one of the country's biggest tech companies. Search engine Baidu reported a net loss of 327 million yuan ($47 million) for the three months to March due to a slump in its main online advertising business.That was the company's first loss since it went public in 2005, and compared with a profit of 6.7 billion yuan during the same period last year. Baidu's stock price plunged more than 10% in premarket trading, wiping nearly $5.8 billion off its market value. CEO Robin Li said the sharp drop in earnings was due in part to China's broader economic slowdown and increased government scrutiny of online content, which had hurt the company's core business. Online marketing accounted for 73% of Baidu's quarterly revenue of $3.6 billion."Although the Chinese government has announced many economic policies to bolster the economy ... we are taking a cautious view that online marketing in the near term will face a more challenging environment," Li said during an earnings call. China's economic growth has slumped to a near three-decade low in recent months, as the country grapples with an escalating trade war against the United States and tries to rein in high levels of debt. Baidu is trying to broaden out its sources of revenue beyond its core search business, investing billions in areas like artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles.The company announced Thursday that the head of its main search business, Hailong Xiang, had resigned after 14 years at the company. Baidu named its vice president of mobile products as his successor, saying the mobile and search businesses would now be combined into one. The company's disappointing performance was in contrast to its two main Chinese tech competitors, Tencent and Alibaba, both of which reported strong earnings earlier this week. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

US Huawei Vendors Sink on US Punitive OrderCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 16, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 505 wordsBody       The head of the White House yesterday signed a presidential decree prohibiting US companies from using telecommunications equipment from foreign companies considered to be at risk. The measure hits Huawei directly and neither have its suppliers escaped the red tide in the markets today.  US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order declaring a national emergency, which bans companies in the country from using telecommunications equipment from foreign companies considered to be at risk, a move aimed mainly at China and the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.  The news was given by 19:30 in Washington (already 00:30 this Thursday in Lisbon), that is, after the close of the European and North American exchanges and shortly before the opening of Asian markets.  Huawei has already responded to this presidential decree, saying that the United States will lag behind in the development of 5G and that bans could raise "serious legal issues."  The Chinese government also reacted with the Ministry of Commerce to stress that it "vehemently" opposes the use of unilateral sanctions by other states over Chinese enterprises. And so he said he was prepared to take steps to protect the interests of companies such as Huawei.  And even though this is already a measure of the US alone - Germany and France, for example, have already said that they will not follow in the footsteps of the US Administration - investors were afraid and the reaction in the markets did not wait , with major US suppliers of Huawei slipping.  US semiconductor traders such as Micron Technology are among the most penalized in Thursday's stock market session on fears that their sales may be at risk.  If they are in fact banned from selling products to Huawei Technologies, their revenues will be severely penalized, Morgan Stanley notes in a review note quoted by Bloomberg.  According to the same research, led by analyst Josephn Moore, Micron - which continues to fall 3.15% on Wall Street - has directed 13% of its sales to Huawei in the last two quarters.  Other companies operating in the areas of radio-frequency and networking, such as Skyworks Solutions (down 5.43%) and Qorvo (-6.04%), obtain about 10% of their revenues from sales to Huawei.  Meanwhile, Broadcom (-2.69%) is looking for around 4.5% of its turnover and exports to this Chinese company.  That is, the greater the exposure to Huawei in terms of revenues, the greater the drop in the stock market.  But there is more. Many other North American companies, such as Analog Devices, ON Semiconductor, Maxim, Texas Instruments, Xilinx and Inphi, follow in the red to the account of this executive order signed by Trump, since they depend greatly on Huawei for part of the money they fit.  Analyst David Kang of B. Riley writes in an analysis quoted by Bloomberg that the US companies most exposed to Huawei are NeoPhotonics and Lumentum Holdings. They are now sinking 15.85% and 8.48%, respectively.  Learn more about DeGiro's online trading solutions.       Load-Date: May 16, 2019End of Document

The US Department of Justice brought a lawsuit in January chargingHuawei with fraud and the theft of trade secrets that is now makings its way through the courts as the US-China trade war continues unabated. The executive also said that he was not aware of Foxconn's move to cut production, the South China Morning Post reported.The technology giant has previously acknowledged that it is speeding up efforts to develop its own smartphone operating system and app store in response to Trump's administration adding the company to a trade blacklist.If the report is indeed true,Huawei could come into a staggering halt in its ambition to become the world's largest smartphone brand.Huawei officials have questioned whether the diversions were truly inadvertent.TheHuawei ban imposed earlier this month forbids U.S. companies like Google from providing critical services toHuawei, and the move is expected to obliterate overseas demand for Huawei's smartphones.Weekly oil prices down sharply amid trade concernsOil prices tank as the trade conflict spreads () was trading at $276.52 per share on Friday afternoon, down $2.51 (-0.90%). Front-month contract prices have lost more than 9% month to date and will wrap up the week off more than 5%.Now, China's biggest tech company said it's reviewing its relationship with the US delivery service.The decision has triggered companies to suspend their contracts with the company, including Google, which blockedHuawei's access to Android updates.The US alleges thatHuawei has deep ties to the Chinese government and that its presence in the US is a national security issue.

Cathay Bank/UCLA Anderson Forecast U.S.-China Economic Report Updates Analysis of Trade Agreement TalksGlobeNewswireApril 18, 2019 Thursday 9:00 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: ECONOMIC RESEARCH AND REPORTSLength: 518 wordsBodyLOS ANGELES, April  18, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In its first quarter report for 2019, the Cathay Bank/UCLA Anderson Forecast U.S.-China Economic Report notes that trade negotiations between the U.S. and China are making progress, which may mean that an agreement between the two countries is under way. While the possibility of a resolution is encouraging, it does not diminish or eliminate potential tensions or disputes that may arise between the two largest economies in the world.As mentioned in previous reports, "The world is in a new era of strategic competition between the U.S. and China, particularly in the fields of science and technology," says William Yu, UCLA Anderson Forecast economist. That tension was evident when a U.S. Senate panel discovered that work that Google may have done in China directly benefitted the country's military. Google's response:  it said it had dropped some ideas it had been pursing with the Chinese government. "We expect more of this state scrutiny and regulation with respect to technologically sophisticated products and services in the future," says Yu.Amid ongoing discussions, all of the U.S. trading partners have had an increase in U.S. exports, with the exception of China and Hong Kong. The latter is attributable to China's retaliation against the U.S. tariffs and to the slowing growth of China's economy. The potential new trade agreement could well usher in a two-tiered trading relationship between the U.S and China. One tier would include some consumer goods, services, some investment, and tourism, which would resume in a relatively free trade environment. The other tier of goods and services, involving advanced technology, information, communication, and national security, would be governed by strategic competition parameters rather than free trade.For a full report of the Cathay Bank/UCLA Anderson Forecast, click here: (https://bit.ly/2GmYKlD).About UCLA Anderson ForecastUCLA Anderson Forecast is one of the most widely watched and often-cited economic outlooks for California and the nation, and was unique in predicting both the seriousness of the early-1990s downturn in California and the strength of the state's rebound since 1993.

Biopolymer Packaging Market: Global Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2019-2024 - Growing Government Regulations for Bio Based Packaging Driving Growth - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJune 26, 2019 Wednesday 10:59 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1233 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Biopolymer Packaging Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Biopolymer Packaging market is projected to register a CAGR of 22.68%, during the forecast period (2019 - 2024)Biopolymers refer to naturally occurring polymers, primarily from renewable sources, such as plants and animals, which are helpful in manufacturing plastics. Furthermore, the market is focusing on increasing the production capabilities of biopolymers.• Increasing concerns about sustainable packaging created considerable demand for bioplastics. For example, several consumer goods companies, such as Samsung and Apple, are using bioplastics for packaging.• For example, as of January 2019, Samsung's electronics division announced its new sustainability policy, which involves changing product packaging for its phones, tablets, and appliances. Products, such as televisions, fridges, and washing machines, will no longer use plastic bags. Instead, they will be packed in bags made of recycled plastic and bioplastics, which are produced from biomass materials, like vegetable fats, corn starch, and sugar cane. Moreover, in the global scenario, the packaging is the most prominent application of biopolymers.• However, increasing consolidation in the global market and stringent environmental regulations are expected to boost the demand for biopolymers in the near future.• For instance, in January 2019, Danish enzyme manufacturer, Novozymes launched a joint venture with Carbios, a prominent biotechnology company, which based in France, to commercialize the production of biodegradable plastics, primarily with the help of plastic degrading enzymes.Scope of the ReportBiopolymers are polymers that are produced by living organisms. Some of the biopolymers are proteins, lipids, DNA, RNA, and carbohydrates. The report has segmented the market Material Type (Non-Bio-degradable (PET, PA, PTT, and Others)), Bio-Degradable (PLA, PBAT, Starch Blends, Others)), End-user (Food & Beverages, Retail, Healthcare, Automotive), and Region.Key Market TrendsFood and Beverages Industry is Expected to Witness a Significant Growth in the Forecast Period• Innovations in the fields of biopolymers are expected to drive the market during the forecast period. According to Indian Science Journal, scientists have made biopolymer films from potato peel and fruit pomace, which can be used to store perishable food products, such as bread. The biopolymer films made from potato peels and fruit pomace waste are 0.3 millimeters thin and can withstand temperatures as high as 200 degree Celsius. They have good breakage strength and elongation capacity.• The impending government regulations regarding single-use plastic packaging in China is causing the companies to ramp up the production of biodegradable plastics. For instance, the founder and chairman of Saton Daily Necessities would be spending USD 15 million to produce biodegradable straws made from polylactide acid (PLA - a type of bioplastic or biopolymer) by doubling the size of the factory.• Food and Beverages companies have started to come with initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In order to support such moves In October 2016, PepsiCo collaborated with Danimer Scientific for the development of Danimer Scientifics' biodegradable film resins to meet the sustainable flexible packaging requirements of PepsiCo's global food and beverage business. This partnership has enabled companies to expand biopolymer technology to provide innovative bioplastic solutions to a wider range of applications and products.Asia-pacific is expected to Register a fastest growth rate in the Forecast Period• The Asia-Pacific region is the largest producer and consumer of biopolymers, globally. According to the statistics released by the European Bioplastics, around 56% of the global bioplastics production is accounted for by the region. When compared to 2016, this data suggests that the country increased its production capacity by over 28%.• The Chinese government has stressed upon pollution-free economic progress which has made Chinese plastic makers look for biodegradable materials. A move like this would boost the usage of biopolymers that can be used for packaging thereby influencing the market in a positive way.• Moreover, a recent study by the European Bioplastics indicates that most of the investment in new bio-based polymer capacities are expected to take place in the Asia-Pacific region, owing to better access to feedstock and a favorable political framework.Competitive LandscapeThe competitive rivalry in the biopolymer packaging market is high owing to the presence of certain key players like Baraskem SA, Arkema SA, BASF SE, Toray Industries Inc. and many more. These firms are able to gain a competitive advantage over other players due to their ability to consistently innovate their products that could meet the demands of their consumers. This is possible due to their continued investments in research and development activities, mergers and acquisitions and strategic partnerships with other firms or institutions.• January 2019 - The European Commission cleared the company's acquisition of Solvay's polyamide business. This acquisition is expected to complement the company's engineering plastics portfolio while enhancing access to key markets in Asia and South America. Furthermore, it is expected to strengthen the company's value chain, through backward integration, in key raw materials, such as ADN.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Introduction to Market Drivers and Restraints4.3 Market Drivers4.3.1 The Growing Government Regulations for Bio Based Packaging4.3.2 Increasing Awareness for Human Well Being and Eco Friendly Products4.4 Market Restraints4.4.1 Performance Issues with Bio Based Materials4.4.2 High Cost of Biopackaging Materials4.5 Value Chain Analysis4.6 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis4.6.1 Threat of New Entrants4.6.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers/Consumers4.6.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers4.6.4 Threat of Substitute Products4.6.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Material Type5.1.1 Non-biodegradable5.1.1.1 PET5.1.1.2 PA5.1.1.3 PTT5.1.1.4 Other Material Types5.1.2 By Biodegradability5.1.2.1 PLA5.1.2.2 Starch Blends5.1.2.3 PBAT5.1.2.4 Other Biodegradability Types5.2 By End-user Industry5.2.1 Food and Beverages5.2.2 Retail5.2.3 Healthcare5.2.4 Automotive5.2.5 Other End-user Industries5.3 Geography6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles6.1.1 Arkema SA6.1.2 BASF SE6.1.3 NatureWorks LLC6.1.4 Novamont SpA6.1.5 Plantic Technologies Ltd6.1.6 Baraskem SA6.1.7 Biome Technologies PLC6.1.8 Bio-On SpA6.1.9 Toray Industries Inc6.1.10 Spectra Packaging Solutions Ltd6.1.11 United Biopolymers SA6.1.12 PTT MCC Biochem Company Ltd7 INVESTMENT ANALYSIS8 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/joa4m0View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190626005371/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Press Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900Related Topics: Packaging ,            Bioplasticshttp://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: June 28, 2019End of Document

Veto Huawei, a blow to the chip industry in the USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 17, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1043 wordsBody Yesterday the actions of some of Huawei's most important US suppliers fell after the Trump administration stepped up attacks on the Chinese technology group.  The White House and the US Department of Commerce took action Wednesday night that can effectively ban Huawei from selling technology in the US market, and also prevent it from buying semiconductors from suppliers in the United States, such as Qualcomm, which are crucial for its production. .  Qualcomm, the US chip maker, which earns about 5 percent of its Huawei revenue, saw its shares fall by almost 4 percent to settle at $ 83.08 at lunchtime yesterday in NY, despite the fact that There was a positive market in general. The titles of Broadcom, another of the suppliers, fell 2.5 percent.  The Information Technology Industry Council, which represents the suppliers of Huawei, Qualcomm, Intel and Microsoft, raised concerns about the US measure and urged management to "work with the industry" to minimize side effects.  The Commerce Department said it will include Huawei in its so-called Entity List, which means that US companies will have to obtain a government license to sell technology to Huawei. At the same time, Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring that the US telecommunications sector faces a "national emergency", giving the commerce department the power to "prohibit transactions that pose an unacceptable risk" to national security. .  The increase in pressure on Huawei comes a few days after the trade war between the US and China intensified sharply, with Trump raising tariffs to 25 percent on Chinese imports and Beijing taking similar retaliatory measures.  Countries such as Japan and Australia banned Huawei - which leads the way in the development of next-generation 5G high-speed networks around the world - and raised concerns that it could help the Chinese government carry out electronic espionage. However, Washington still has problems convincing allies such as the United Kingdom and Germany to do the same.  The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday that it opposes Washington's "abuse of export control measures," saying that Beijing will do "what it takes" to protect the interests of the companies.  China also said it formally charged two Canadians who were detained last year, something that Beijing-based diplomats called retaliation for the arrest by Canada's Huawei financial director Meng Wanzhou.  The move delighted hardline Republicans, who are campaigning for Trump to take a tougher stance with China. Tom Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas, well received the decision, and wrote in a tweet: "@Huawei 5G, RIP. Thanks for participating".  Samm Sacks, an expert on cybersecurity in China from New America, a think tank based in Washington, said that including Huawei on the blacklist is "a nuclear option" and that "will have chain effects" on a global scale.  Paul Triolo, technology policy expert at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy, said it was a "big event" that would not only hurt the Chinese firm but also impact global supply chains involving US companies. like Intel, Microsoft and Oracle.  "The United States openly declared that it is willing to participate in a full-fledged technology war with China," he said.  The List of Entities is the index ofindividuals, businesses and other organizations of the Department of Commerce that are considered a risk to the national security of the United States. While the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or terrorism are among the possible reasons for being included in the list, the US government may also include companies on the list for risks not specified for safety or even only for the objectives of the list. the foreign policy of the country.  Although the inclusion in the list is a step below that is considered a "Rejected Person" - the total ban that was imposed last year on the Chinese telecommunications equipment company ZTE - the United States export control authorities claim that the requests of licenses of the American suppliers to export to the companies in the list "normally are subject to a policy of negation".  Don Vieira, a senior national security lawyer in the US Department of Justice, said the measures suggested that the White House gave the green light to intelligence agencies and the commerce department to "confront" Huawei.  "I do not know if the US can destroy Huawei, but maybe the US government can get some concessions," said Vieira, a partner at the Skadden Arps law firm.  Huawei responded to the measures by ensuring that it is ready to collaborate with the United States government to guarantee the safety of its products.  He added that restricting Huawei poses "serious legal problems" and that "it would only serve to limit the United States to lower alternatives, and yet more expensive ones."  Dennis Wilder, China's former head of analysis at the CIA, mentioned that the combination of the executive order and the inclusion on the list is "pressure on the whole field" against Huawei, which represents "the beginning of the separation" of the Chinese telecommunications.  Executives and analysts from the semiconductor industry said the impact of Huawei's listing on the Entity List was unclear, as it remains to be seen if the US government is prepared to issue licenses to export to the company.  TENSIONS  THE ANSWER  "We urge the US to stop its wrong actions to avoid further damage to Sino-US relations," said Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng.  LEGITIMATE DEFENSE  Gao said he is against unilateral measures against any Chinese entity and that the government will take measures to "safeguard the legitimate interest of our companies."  FROM FRANCE  French President Emmanuel Macron estimated that "launching a technological or commercial war against any country now (...) is not appropriate", referring to the EU-China tensions.  REITERA CONDEMNS  Canada reiterated its condemnation of the "arbitrary" detention of two Canadian citizens in China and alleges that it is a reprisal for the capture in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's financial director.  With information from Demetri Sevastopulo, James Politi, Nian Liu, Kathrin Hille, Alice Woodhouse, Christian Shepherd and Archie Zhang. Load-Date: May 17, 2019End of Document

CHINA: Ministry revamp slows carbon trading planClimateWireMay 9, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLCSection: INTERNATIONAL; Vol. 10; No. 9Length: 621 wordsBodyA bureaucratic reshuffle has left China months behind in its preparation to launch a national carbon market, potentially slowing efforts to restrain greenhouse gas emissions by the world's biggest polluter. The delays in the initial phase of development are due to a regulatory restructuring last year that saw responsibility for the carbon market moved to the new environment ministry, according to an adviser to the Chinese government on climate change policies. Despite the hiccup, the nation should still be able to meet its 2020 launch target, according to the adviser, Ma Aimin. "The first phase was slower than originally planned," said Ma, deputy director-general of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy & International Cooperation. With the reshaping of ministries largely completed, "China is pushing ahead efforts to develop the national carbon market in a steady manner." The environmental ministry didn't reply to a fax seeking comment. China's use of financial markets to help cut greenhouse gases is expected to result in the world's biggest market for trading carbon emissions. The program will force utilities to buy permits to pollute as a means to balance the nation's campaign against climate change with rising electricity demand from its 1.4 billion people. Environmental watchdog The Ministry of Ecology & Environment took over climate duties from the National Development & Reform Commission when it was created in March 2018 as part of a major government overhaul. The consolidation of staff and functions, particularly at the provincial level, dragged on until the start of 2019, according to Ma. A bureaucratic shift of that size would "unavoidably have some impact on the progress of building a carbon market," said Zhao Xiaolu, a China Climate Initiative manager at Environmental Defense Fund, a global non-profit organization. "The government restructuring wasn't anticipated when the work plan timeline was released." Policymakers outlined in 2017 a three-step process toward creating the market. The first phase, which was supposed to last about a year, would be focused on developing systems for data reporting, registration and trading. The second stage, which would also take a year, focused on mock trading of carbon credits to test the effectiveness and reliability of the market. Spot trading would follow in the third and final step. Massive scale Regulators were still seeking feedback as of last week on draft trading rules, which were originally scheduled to be finalized by the end of last year. The outcome of China's emissions trading system is being closely watched by businesses and governments as its massive scale could shape global trends and spur a faster transition toward clean energy. The market, covering 1,700 companies across the power sector, has the potential to manage about a quarter of the world's carbon emissions. China is also drawing lessons from other regions, including the European Union, whose carbon market was up and running in about three years from the time it was proposed, according to Liu Shuang, a program director at Energy Foundation China, which provides grants to projects that support sustainable energy development. A lack of accurate data led to a surplus of allowances on the European market, which kept prices depressed for years. Lawmakers revamped the system last year and it's now expected to keep the cost of pollution on an upward trajectory through 2030. The slow start reflects China's desire to foresee and avoid problems that may emerge, Liu said. These include emission measurements, permit allocations and enforcement. "It's important to design a carbon market that fulfills policy objectives," Liu said. -- BloombergLoad-Date: June 6, 2019End of Document

Pompeo Blasts China's Treatment Of Uighurs On 30th Anniversary Of Tiananmen MassacreThe FrontrunnerJune 4, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 310 wordsBodyPolitico (6/3, Toosi, 4.29M) reports that in a statement coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, Secretary of State Pompeo "slammed China's human rights record," and "call[ed] on Beijing to end its oppression of Uighur Muslims and other groups." Pompeo wrote, "China's one-party state tolerates no dissent and abuses human rights whenever it serves its interests." According to Politico, Pompeo "has consistently pointed out China's human rights abuses during his tenure as secretary of state, among a raft of critiques the secretary of state has leveled at Beijing - from its militarization of the South China Sea and the Arctic to its trade practices to its use of mass surveillance."World Prepares To Mark 30th Anniversary Of Tiananmen Square Massacre As China Seeks To Erase It.NBC Nightly News (6/3, story 8, 2:00, Holt, 162K) reported that as the world prepares to mark 30 years since the Tiananmen Square massacre, "the Chinese government has gone to great lengths to erase the memory of that day, and prevent protests like it from happening again." Richard Engel reported that, in China, "the massacre has been scrubbed from the history books and the internet so thoroughly, many young Chinese don't even know it happened." Engel continued, "China is so determined not to have another Tiananmen uprising it's created an unprecedented surveillance state, using artificial intelligence to mind social media and integrating facial recognition into a vast network of security cameras." Elizabeth Palmer reported on the CBS Evening News (6/3, story 7, 2:15, Begnaud, 152K) reported Tiananmen Square remains "so sensitive that even tourists have to show ID, and there are surveillance cameras everywhere." Palmer added that they showed several photographs of the event to young passersby and "ended up in custody for six hours."Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

'Misrouted in Error': FedEx Sends China-Bound Huawei Packages to USStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeMay 29, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 390 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyHuawei said that two packages sent to its Chinese offices from Japan were redirected to the US, with FedEx attempting to divert two more packages sent from Vietnam to other Huawei offices in Asia.Huawei has maintained it is independent of the Chinese state and has now accused American courier FedEx of diverting its packages to the U.S., despite the fact they were travelling between Asian addresses. Two other packages heading for Huawei offices in Singapore and Hong Kong were held up after arriving at FedEx processing stations in both those cities for "delivery exception".Huawei says the documents contained documents rather than technology and declined to speculate on why it thought the packages were diverted.On Tuesday, FedEx released an apology on Chinese social media saying "we apologize for the small number of Huawei packages that were mistakenly rerouted", adding: "We confirm that no outside party requested FedEx to reroute these packages".After two packages from Shenzhen-based Huawei's overseas offices containing urgent paperwork were redirected by FedEx to the United States, the tech giant has said it's reconsidering its relationship with the company. More details can be found at the source link below.Ren Zhengfei: I will object to any retaliation against AppleWhy do students have to object to the teacher? "And second of all, if that happens, I'll be the first to protest", Ren was quoted to have said.Huawei acknowledged to Reuters that one package originating in Vietnam was received by Friday, and the other was on its way, according to FedEx tracking records provided by Huawei.The US Commerce Department also added Huawei into the Entity List, which set a unsafe precedent, Song said.Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services. "Hence, the shipment is not deliver to consignee and now being hold at FDX station and under process to RTS it (return to sender)", the representative wrote in broken English, according to an email Huawei showed to Reuters.In other words, according to FedEx, yes, some packages went the wrong way: that happens when you ship 15 million parcels a day. Nonetheless, the telecom kit maker has reportedly filed a complaint with China's State Postal Bureau.Huawei also confirmed that the said shipments only had documents.Load-Date: May 30, 2019End of Document

Beijing celebration of building binge overshadowed by debtAssociated Press InternationalApril 24, 2019 Wednesday 10:15 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 955 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A conference this week showcasing a Chinese initiative to help build ports, railways and other infrastructure in the developing world is casting a spotlight on complaints the projects leave some countries with too much debt.Asian and African leaders plan to press for relief from politically volatile debt burdens at the Belt and Road conference that begins Thursday in Beijing. That could bring a note of tension to an event meant to be an official celebration of President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative.The Belt and Road has stirred anxiety in Washington, Moscow and Tokyo about Beijing's strategic ambitions as well as how projects are devised, managed and financed. The meeting starting Thursday brings together leaders or envoys from three dozen countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Serbia, Myanmar and Kenya.Debt "is going to be part of the prime minister's focus at the forum," said Billenne Seyoum, press secretary for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia.In a meeting Wednesday, Xi told Abiy that Beijing had forgiven interest due on loans owed by Ethiopia through the end of 2018, the prime minister's office announced on its Facebook page. It gave no financial details.Other governments welcomed Beijing's initiative in a region the Asian Development Bank says needs $26 trillion of investment by 2030 to keep economies growing. But countries including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have canceled or renegotiated railways and other projects they concluded were too expensive or unproductive.Most projects are built by Chinese state-owned companies and financed with loans from government banks at commercial interest rates that critics say could leave borrowers mired in debt they cannot repay.Beijing also faces grumbling by the United States, Japan, India and Russia that Belt and Road is a tool to build a China-centered political structure and erode their influence. American officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have told countries considering Belt and Road projects to look closely at Beijing's motives and warned about debt."BRI project financing will be a main topic for discussion" at the forum, said James Su of research firm Fitch Solutions in an email. He said Chinese leaders appear ready to discuss "more sustainable" financing to ease fears of a "debt trap.""We see this as crucial for China as it seeks to reduce negative sentiment surrounding the initiative," said Su.Beijing has given some borrowers more time to repay or made other concessions. Ethiopia's Abiy reached agreement in September to extend repayment for a $4 billion railway linking his country with neighboring Djibouti from 10 years to 30 years.Pakistan, which is building 22 Belt and Road projects including power plants and highways, has run into a debt crunch that forced it to ask the International Monetary Fund for an $8 billion bailout. But authorities say Prime Minister Imran Khan has no plans to ask China to renegotiate their deals during this week's forum.China has invested $13 billion in Pakistan and lent $6 billion for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a series of 22 projects.Washington argues the IMF shouldn't help Pakistani repay Chinese lenders.Despite debt concerns, Ethiopia and other governments express support for Belt and Road and want more Chinese financing.Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta plans to pursue a $3.7 billion loan from Beijing this week to extend a Chinese-built railway, his government's ambassador to Beijing, Sarah Serem, told The Nation newspaper.That is despite complaints the railway is unproductive and cannot pay for itself. The 962-kilometer (597-mile) project is intended to link Kenya with central Africa and Congo.Kenya owes Chinese banks $3.2 billion for its first 472-kilometer (293-mile) link from the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa to the capital, Nairobi. Kenya is due to borrow almost $10 billion from Beijing for the full project.The Nation said in September that Kenyatta wants China to pay for half of the next stage but other news reports said Beijing balked at that.Beijing scored a diplomatic coup in March when Italy became the first member of the Group of Seven major economies, which includes the United States, to sign an agreement to support Belt and Road.The number of countries that have signed at least preliminary Belt and Road agreements has risen to 115 from 64 in 2013, according to the Chinese government."As its relationship with the U.S. has soured, China is increasingly looking to the BRI to provide a tool for geopolitical influence," said Moody's analysts in a report in January.Elsewhere in Europe, a 42-kilometer (26-mile) Chinese-built highway in Montenegro has prompted complaints the 810 million euro ($910 million) project is costly and wasteful."The project is completely unfavorable for Montenegro," said Ivan Kekovic, a civil engineer in Podgorica, the country's capital.Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic defended the deal, saying in an interview any contractors could bid but only Chinese companies submitted concrete proposals.In the Indian Ocean, President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih of the Maldives says he wants to review the country's Belt and Road projects and debt.Chinese officials say Beijing is learning from experience and examining borrowers closely to make sure they can repay loans.Possibly due to tighter scrutiny, the number of new Belt and Road projects has plunged.The total value of new contracts fell 42 percent in the first half of 2018 compared with a year earlier, according to Moody's.___Munir Ahmed in Islamabad, Elias Meseret in Addis Ababa, Tom Odula in Nairobi, Roshan Sedhai in Kathmandu, Dusan Stojanovic in Belgrade and Stephen Wright in Jakarta contributed.Load-Date: April 25, 2019End of Document

But Chinese users appear to be rallying around the company, with social media posts on Weibo and Douyin showing strong support for Huawei, according to What s On Weibo.The debate over Huawei and national security was thrust back into the spotlight over the weekend, when, as part of a US government order, Google revoked Huawei s Android license, which cuts the company s phones off entirely from most Google apps and services. It s less of a problem for users in China, given nearly all Google services don t function in China anyway, but the move is far more problematic for Huawei s efforts to expand beyond its Chinese customer base to places like Europe and the US.Per What s On Weibo s report, Chinese customers are posting in support of Huawei with declarations that they ll continue using their Huawei phones or to purchase their next device from the company in the future. Hashtag campaigns for  Huawei Doesn t Need to Rely on America for its Microchips  (#              #) and  Huawei s Self-Developed Operating System Hong Meng  (#          #) were also trending on Weibo, highlighting that Huawei already develops many of its own components for its phones, as well as the in-house operating system that Huawei has been developing for just this sort of circumstance.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632988/huawei-google-android-license-china-customers-support-weibo-douyinContact Information:Chaim GartenbergTags:,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: May 21, 2019End of Document

Big Tech has a lot to lose in the Trump-Xi Jinping talksCNN WireJune 27, 2019 Thursday 1:48 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1117 wordsByline: By Clare Duffy, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  As President Donald Trump arrives in Japan for the G20 summit, Big Tech companies will be closely watching his planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.The trade dispute between the United States and China has disrupted a lot companies. The stakes for tech are particularly high. "Everything in the trade war is hurting us as well as the Chinese," said Matt Gold, a law professor at Fordham University and former trade negotiator.Most experts don't expect a formal trade agreement to come out of the meeting, though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC that he thinks there is "a path to complete this." Whether or not the trade dispute can be resolved has important implications for many US companies' abilities to continue making or selling products in China.Here are some of the tech companies likely to be monitoring the meeting:AppleChina has long been a hub for manufacturing American goods. But with the trade war dragging on, Apple and a number of other tech companies, including Google and Nintendo, have begun to consider shifting production out of China. Relocating manufacturing to elsewhere in Southeast Asia would help these companies avoid tariffs on Chinese-made goods that risk harming their ability to turn a profit, and could also prevent higher prices for consumers. Apple last week asked its major suppliers to explore the costs of moving some production from China to places like India and Vietnam, according to a Nikkei report. But China has better infrastructure to support manufacturing than those countries, making shifting manufacturing elsewhere costly and difficult. It's an even greater challenge for technology companies than for, say, apparel companies who don't have to rely on the same kind of highly trained workforce."This is not making shirts, this is very sophisticated," said Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst with Susquehanna International Group. "It requires dedicated labor and a very extensive supply chain. If electronics companies had to move production outside of China, it would involve significant costs for training workforce and building new infrastructure." Last month, the United States hiked import tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in Chinese goods, including electronic equipment. And now Trump says he is considering applying a 10% to 25% tariff to an additional $300 billion in Chinese exports.Apple, Dell Technologies and more than half a dozen other tech companies wrote to the Trump administration last week asking to be exempted from that extension of tariffs. The Consumer Technology Association estimates the tariff would raise the average cost of cell phones by $70 and the average cost of laptops by $120.For these companies, the G20 meeting represents a chance to see Trump relax his stance on taxing Chinese exports and to put the brakes on expensive potential supply chain shifts. "We hope to see a deal and encourage the US and Chinese governments to continue a dialogue to resolve outstanding issues," a Dell Technologies spokesperson said. GoogleAt the same time that the United States and China have ratcheted up the trade war with tit-for-tat tariffs and other retaliatory measures, the White House has raised concerns about the safety of producing goods in China because of intellectual property violations.That's among the reasons tech companies, including Google, might be looking to move manufacturing or assembly of sensitive products like motherboards out of China. While a trade resolution would be unlikely to dispel legitimate security concerns, Hosseini said he thinks it might take the pressure off of tech companies to respond by leaving China altogether. "There are companies that have been in China since the 1980s without any problems with security," Hossseini said. "Tech companies have already been doing things to safeguard their data and production. Some of these concerns, in my opinion, are just negotiating tactics." Huawei The trade war has also coincided with the US government's implementation of an export ban against telecom equipment giant Huawei and five other Chinese enterprises.The move threatens to topple Huawei's spot as the second largest smartphone seller in the world because it relies on products from US companies --- Android software from Google, chips from Intel and Broadcomm --- to make cell phones. Huawei sued the US government in March saying the export ban singled it out unfairly, and the company has downgraded its revenue expectations for 2019 and 2020 by $30 billion. Technically, trade negotiations and national security measures like the export ban are separate. But Trump has said he might consider concessions for Huawei as part of a trade deal with China. However, such a deal could set a dangerous precedent, according to Gold. "Both the President's timing of certain actions and hints that the President has made expressly have raised fears that he's offering the Chinese a compromise of our national security enforcement in exchange for the kinds of concessions that he can boast about on the campaign trail," Gold said. "If we put legitimate enforcement of our national security laws on the table in trade negotiation, we are inviting our adversaries to demand we drop national security enforcement at future trade negotiation tables."MicronHuawei isn't the only one affected by the export ban. American tech companies including Micron, Intel and Qualcomm also count on sales of smartphone components and software to the Chinese company. Huawei was Micron's top customer prior to the ban. Revenue for Micron's mobile business unit was down 33% from the prior year due in part to lowered shipments to Huawei, Micron Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said during the company's third quarter earnings call Tuesday.Micron did say that in recent weeks, the company found that it can legally continue to sell certain products to Huawei and resumed those shipments. But questions over whether restrictions will be tightened continues to create challenges for the company. "There is obviously considerable uncertainty here," Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrota said Tuesday. And Susquehanna International Group's Hosseini said that uncertainty extends beyond Micron. "There appears to be some gray area where companies may be able to ship to Huawei through third party distributors, but it's not clear," Hosseini said, adding that he doesn't expect the confusion to be resolved by the Trump-Xi meeting this weekend. "I do expect some sort of a handshake for window dressing, but not a clear resolution with details coming out," Hosseini said.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Why the meeting between Trump and Jinping is important at the G20CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 28, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1105 wordsBodyExpansion/Clare DuffyAs President Donald Trump arrives in Japan for the G20 summit, big tech companies will closely observe their meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.The u.S.-China trade dispute has affected many companies. Bets on the technology sector are particularly high."Everything in the trade war is affecting us and the Chinese alike," said Matt Gold, a professor of law at Fordham University and a former trade negotiator.Most experts don't expect a formal trade deal to emerge from the meeting, though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday that he believes there is "a way to complete this."The fact that the trade dispute may or may not be resolved has important implications for the ability of many U.S. companies to continue manufacturing or selling products in China.Asian giant China has long been a manufacturing center for American products. But, with the advancement of the trade war, Apple and several other technology companies, such as Google and Nintendo, have begun to consider shifting production out of China.The relocation of manufacturing in other parts of Southeast Asia would help these companies avoid tariffs on Chinese-made products that risk them to damage their ability to make a profit, and could also prevent higher prices for Consumers. Last week, Apple asked its major suppliers to explore the costs of moving some of China's production to places like India and Vietnam, according to a Nikkei report.But China has better infrastructure to support manufacturing than those countries, making moving manufacturing elsewhere costly and difficult. It's an even bigger challenge for technology companies than for, say, apparel companies that don't rely on the same type of highly skilled workforce."This isn't t-shirts, it's very sophisticated," said Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group. "It requires dedicated labor and a very extensive supply chain. If electronics companies had to move production out of China, it would involve significant costs of workforce training and building new infrastructure."Last month, the United States raised import tariffs to 25% of $200 billion (mdd) on Chinese products, including electronic equipment. And now Trump says he's considering a 10- to 25% tariff on an additional 300,000 mdd on Chinese exports.Apple, Dell Technologies and more than half a dozen other tech companies wrote to the Trump administration in the past few days to ask for an exemption from that fee extension. The Consumer Technology Association estimates that the tariff would raise the average cost of cell phones by $70 and the average cost of laptops by $120.For these companies, the G20 meeting represents an opportunity to see Trump relax his stance on taxing Chinese exports and curbing potential costly changes in the supply chain."We look forward to seeing an agreement and encourage the U.S. and Chinese governments to continue a dialogue to resolve outstanding issues," a spokesman for Dell Technologies said.At the same time that the United States and China have intensified trade war with 'eye for an eye' tariff and other retaliatory measures, the White House has expressed concern about the safety of producing goods in China due to property violationsIntellectual.That's one of the reasons technology companies, including Google, might be looking to move the manufacturing or assembly of sensitive products, such as motherboards, out of China.While a trade resolution is unlikely to address legitimate security concerns, Hosseini said he believes it could take the pressure on tech companies to respond by leaving China altogether."There are companies that have been in China since the 1980s without any problems with security," Hossseini said. "Tech companies have already been doing things to safeguard their data and production. Some of these concerns, in my opinion, are just negotiating tactics."huaweiThe trade war has also coincided with the US government's implementation of an export ban against telecom equipment giant Huawei and five other Chinese companies.The move threatens to take down Huawei's position as the second-largest smartphone seller in the world because it relies on products from Us A.S. companies - Google's Android software, Intel chips and Broadcomm - to make their phones Cell. Huawei sued the U.S. government in March saying the export ban unfairly attacked him unfairly, and the company has lowered its revenue expectations for 2019 and 2020 by 30,000 mdd.Technically, trade negotiations and national security measures, such as the export ban, are separate. But Trump has said he might consider making concessions for Huawei, as part of a trade deal with China.However, such an agreement could set a dangerous precedent, according to Gold."Both the time the president performed certain actions and the indications he has expressly given have raised fears that he is offering the Chinese to compromise compliance with our national security in exchange for types of concessions that he can boast in the campaign," Gold said. "If we put legitimate enforcement of our national security laws on the table in trade negotiation, we are inviting our adversaries to demand that we abandon the application of national security at future trading trading venues."MicronHuawei is not the only one affected by the export ban. U.S. technology companies, including Micron, Intel and Qualcomm, also depend on making sales of smartphone components and software to the Chinese company.Huawei was Micron's main customer before the ban. Revenue for Micron's mobile business unit was down 33% compared to the previous year due in part to reduced shipments to Huawei, Micron's chief financial officer David Zinsner said during the third-quarter results conference of the Company.Micron said that, in recent weeks, the company has discovered that it can legally continue to sell certain products to Huawei and resumed those shipments. But questions about whether the restrictions will be tougher continue to create challenges for the company."Obviously there is considerable uncertainty here," Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrota said Tuesday.And Hosseini, of the Susquehanna International Group, said uncertainty extends beyond Micron."It seems that there is a gray area where companies can ship to Huawei through third-party distributors, but it's not clear," Hosseini said, adding that he doesn't anticipate the confusion going to resolve at the Trump-Xi meeting this weekend."I hopesome kind of handshake to keep appearances, but not a clear resolution with details that emerge from it," Hosseini said. Load-Date: June 28, 2019End of Document

US Chamber Official: China Trade Talks Show Progress On Cloud ComputingThe FrontrunnerMay 3, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 196 wordsBodyReuters (5/2, Alper, Lawder) reports US negotiators engaged in trade talks with China are "likely to win more access to the country's cloud computing market than initially expected, but Chinese commitments to curb industrial subsidies will probably fall short of US demands," US Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Myron Brilliant said Thursday. Brilliant told reporters, "We expect greater market access opening than was initially provided by the Chinese in these negotiations, which was through a pilot zone." However, he added, "It is not clear we will get as much as we would like in that area, but we're going to continue to make this an issue that has to be addressed ultimately, if not in the negotiations, then shortly after."The New York Times (5/2, Swanson, 17.3M) says Brilliant told reporters the talks are "entering the final stage, but a deal is expected to fall short of addressing several key Trump administration goals, including combating Chinese cybertheft and state subsidies at various levels of the Chinese government." The Washington Examiner (5/2, Higgins, 458K) reports Brilliant said the talks were "94.5% finished" and close to "endgame" status.Load-Date: May 4, 2019End of Document

The Shanghai gave up 0.9% that seemed more like profit taking after last week's run higher. There were also reports that President Trump talked down expectations for the G-20 summit. Japanese shares lost ground following media reports that President Trump is mulling a revamp of the long standing peace treaty with Japan, suggesting the state pick up more slack for its defense. Automotive and Export stocks saw weakness with names such as Toyota and Sony both losing 1% on the day. European bourses are doing very little this morning, under very slight pressure in correspondence with the US and Asia.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -1.010 yr Note: 2.02%USD/JPY: 107.09 -0.21EUR/USD: 1.1383 -0.0016Europe: FTSE -0.2% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.1%Asia: Hang Seng -1.2% Shanghai -0.9% Nikkei -0.4%Gold (1432.90 +14.70) Silver (15.45 +0.07) Crude (57.91 +0.01)17:44FBK FB Financial to sell its Correspondent Lending channel to Rushmore Loan Management Services; expects the transaction to close early Q3 (35.08 -0.07)In addition to the $1.1 million restructuring expense reported for the first quarter of 2019, FB Financial expects to record additional restructuring charges of up to $1.5 million to cover transaction related expenses, severance and other items related to its mortgage operations.

Happy Monday, everybody, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 24th.We have breaking news this morning, new threat from Iran, a top official warning Tehran is capable of shooting down more American drones, calling the United States, the enemy. It comes as the White House plans new sanctions that will go into effect today.A Missouri police officer gunned down in the line of duty, meanwhile, this is the 22nd this year, we have the details.Then, the crack-down on big technology continues, new bipartisan legislation set to be unveiled today, looking to put a price on your personal data, what it means to the industry and your privacy.Bitcoin prices racing higher again, the crypto currency briefly topping 11,000, what's behind this rally now? All ahead, right now. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.And we have breaking news this morning, Iran's naval chief is threatening the United States, saying that his country is capable of shooting down more American drones, this as the United States is planning to implement additional sanctions on Tehran, as soon as today, the European allies urging both sides to show restraint.Oil prices meanwhile, are moving higher this morning, on the news. Take a look after last week's 8 percent surge, oil now up another three-quarters of one percent this morning, at 57.87.Markets in terms of stocks, take a look at indications here, Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, Dow Future up 59 points, a quarter of a percent right now, and the S&P Futures up seven, and the NASDAQ Futures higher by 26.Joining me right now is former National Security Council Chief of Staff, Center for Policy President and CEO, Fred Fleitz, Fred, good to have you on the program, this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.FRED FLEITZ, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CENTER FOR SECURITY POLICY: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Characterize the situation with Tehran right now?FLEITZ: Well, you know, the President is struggling with two factors, his promise to get the U.S. out of wars and not to start new wars, and his realization he may have to take military action against Iran. Iran dodged a bullet last week. And look, all this (INAUDIBLE) by Iranian leaders that we can attack the U.S. or hurt it badly, the U.S. could flatten Iran if it had to.The President pulled out of this fraudulent nuclear deal, and this argument that the U.S. is somehow responsible for these increase in tensions. Look, Iran's behavior got worse after the nuclear deal was announced and the argument that, you know, we're responsible for Iran's threats and belligerent activities.The U.S. does not remain in agreement because the other state threatens violence and terrorism, if we withdraw. That would be giving in to blackmail. Our policy's working right now. The ball is in Iran's court.BARTIROMO: Well, what do you want Iran to do, I mean, in their court?FLEITZ: Well, first of all, the U.S. should keep policy it has, because we're denying funds around which spent on terrorism, on meddling in Middle East conflicts, on the troops that Iran has sent into Syria, Iran's going to have to stop the belligerent activity and decide it is time to start negotiations. But if it isn't, we can simply stay the course, our policy is succeeding.BARTIROMO: Yes. On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" yesterday, I spoke with House Armed Services Committee Member Congressman Mike Turner, who said this about the future military action against Tehran should that become really part of the single conversation, so listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Is that the only leverage after all of these sanctions to have some kind of a military situation?REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): Well, I think the President has said and certainly Secretary Pompeo has said that all options are on the table, which includes a military response, and certainly to the extent that Iran has increased its military attacks within the area both on tankers and U.S. drones.We might see in the future that need for a military response, I think it's great that the President showed restraint as a result of the downing of the U.S. drone, but what the President is making clear both with the build-up in the area and with his planning for action is, the President would not hesitate to use military force.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: So, what about that, Fred, would you recommend military force, when the President doesn't want to go to war, but what if Iran keeps up these provocations?FLEITZ: Well, first of all, the President decided that killing 1 to 200 people in retaliation for downing an unarmed drone was unjustified. I think that was a right call. We should have a chief executive who is very careful and thoughtful in taking steps like this.And it worries me there are so many people on the right who want to go to war with Iran, they want to knock out Iran's oil refineries and basically plaster them. We have to have very good justification for doing that. The President is ready to do that if necessary. He's trying to show restraint, I give him a lot of credit for that.And Maria, you know there are a lot of people in this country on the right and left who do not want another war and I think the President is proceeding very carefully on this.BARTIROMO: Yes, and we have seen Iran's economy really get impacted quite a bit by these sanctions, it's continuing to dive. We are watching a lot of economic data, this week, here in the U.S., earnings much anticipated, G20 summit as well, in Osaka, Japan.The President is going to be meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two countries, of course, the trading passes there. The U.S. is also reportedly considering requiring all 5G equipment for domestic use being made outside of China. What's your take in terms of what might get down at the G20 meeting, first off, between the President and President Xi?FLEITZ: Well, I think the exchange that everyone is looking at is the Xi- Trump meeting and what will this -- what will this mean, in terms of a possible future economic deal. And we know the Trump administration is doing everything possible to facilitate a productive outcome.You know, Mike Pence is supposed to give a big speech today, bashing China, but the vice president called it off because trying to set the stage to get China to make the decision that it really wants a deal, we are in a much better position, economically, to get a deal. We know China's economy is hurting for a variety of reasons. This meeting may come at just the right time for a big breakthrough.BARTIROMO: Maybe, but I mean, they reneged on some of the big-ticket items such as continued theft of intellectual property, the forced transfer of technology, can the President do a deal without the Chinese committing on those two issues?FLEITZ: No, those are necessary. And I think there is some dissent within the Chinese government on the concessions they had agreed to earlier. And I also suspect they thought that we want a deal so badly, we'll simply go along with them, back-tracking.Well, President Trump isn't going to go along with that. He said he just doesn't want a good deal, he wants a great deal. And I think this is going to be an opportunity for the two presidents to talk about the key issues that concern both of them and these are things President Trump is not going to back away from.BARTIROMO: And do you see the Chinese actually committing to that?FLEITZ: I'm hoping that the Chinese will commit to continue to talk and to discuss these issues. I don't -- I don't know that we will get a breakthrough on issues such as theft and intellectual property at the meeting, but the fact that China had been talking about them and it looks like there had been an agreement, I think it gives them hope that we can get some movement on it.BARTIROMO: Because this is as much a security threat, a national security issue, as it is an economic deal, right Fred? I mean, the Chinese want to overtake the U.S. as the super power when it comes to the military.FLEITZ: That's right. Well, look, when China was allowed into the global economic system, we thought that it would play fair, it never has played fair. It has exploited international trade. It has set-up a mercantile system where it maximizes exports and tries to import as little as possible, and then to steal technology, it's the worst case of mercantilism in history.And it's about time that a world leader has called China on it, and look, other states are looking at this too. The Europeans have pressed China on the same issues and it's annoying the Chinese because they realize that President Trump has started something, globally, to force the Chinese to start practicing fair trade.BARTIROMO: Well, that's a really good point. Fred it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much.FLEITZ: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Fred Fleitz joining us there. Meanwhile, there's this, a Missouri police officer shot dead, Cheryl Casone with the details there and headlines now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right. Good morning, Maria. Officer Michael Langsdorf was killed in the line of duty overnight. He had been on the job for just three months. This makes 22 police officers killed in the line of duty so far this year.He was shot by somebody trying to cash a bad check. Officials say the suspect is in custody and then a gun has been recovered at the scene.Well, a major protest in Prague, to tell you about, an estimated 250,000 people took to the streets calling for the resignation of the country's prime minister. The billionaire leader, who is being called Czech Trump by some media outlets there, is accused of fraud involving E.U. funds. Now, the event was built as the largest protest since the fall of communism, there.Well, Bitcoin soaring passed the 11,000-dollar mark for the first time, in 15 months, look at this, 10,908 but it was above 11,000 earlier, digital currency is up 170 percent so far this year. Analysts (INAUDIBLE) that the latest boost is coming from Facebook's Libra crypto currency project.Bitcoin hit a record high of over $19,000 though, back in late 2017, one of the many things that you covered while you were in France and welcome back.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Yes, you know, the head of the Facebook crypto currency unit told us it is also good for Bitcoin because it, sort of, legitimizes the sector.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Interesting reaction there from Bitcoin investors, Cheryl. Thanks.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up big technology is on the hill this morning, new bipartisan legislation looks to put a price tag on your personal data. Several congressmen and senators are coming up with legislation to protect your data, coming up. Then Wal-Mart cracks down on theft, a look at how it's using Artificial Intelligence to do just that, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have a big show this morning. Coming up, Florida congressman, former Green Beret and former White House policy adviser for Defense Secretaries Gates and Rumsfeld, Michael Waltz is here this morning.Texas congressman and member of the House Appropriations Committee, Henry Cuellar, joining me, along with Texas congressman and House Financial Services Committee member, Roger Williams. Former ICE Director, Tom Homan, stopping by, along with professional golfer, Bryson DeChambeau, joining us. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big couple of hours coming up.I want to kick this hour off with big tech and your data, a bipartisan effort from two senators looking to crack down on companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon, to force them to reveal the value of their user data. Senator Mark Warner talked about it to Axios, on HBO. Here's what he had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): Clearly, I don't think we'll end up being the long-term status quo case, is that all of this personal information that is being sucked out of us, often times, unknowingly, as we use our phones and devices on a regular basis. That that is not something that is entirely owned by the platform company.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: On the House side, Congressman Kevin McCarthy pushing this through as well, joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Jackie DeAngelis, the Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath, and PWC Partner, Mitch Roschelle, great to see everybody this morning.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Good morning, welcome back.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. And, you know, I mean, Kevin McCarthy will say, look, we ought to know, as the public, what data is being sold and what data is being used for what purposes, and I think it's true.ROSCHELLE: One of the things that's interesting with what they're talking about in the Axios piece is the value of the data, and I think that's very esoteric concept. I think we should step back and be very clear and transparent about what data is out there and who is using it and how is it used.I think putting financial disclosure is in about the value of the data, is just going to further confuse the process, I think the consumer wants to know what their data is and who has it.HILSENRATH: There are so many issues for big tech right now in Washington. It's not -- it's not just this privacy issue of how your data is being used but it's also the idea that these companies have so much power, monopolistic power that needs to be reined in.And then there's also the issue of fairness, are they unfairly, you know -- are they treating conservatives unfairly in forums like Facebook and whatnot, so the big-tech's problems are going to be a big focus in Washington for a while.BARTIROMO: Which is why Devin Nunes, who joined me yesterday, Congressman Nunes is suing Twitter and McClatchy, he's got a court date for Twitter in August for this very reason, because he has been treated differently on Twitter he says, than for example, AOC.HILSENRATH: Right.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the President makes that claim as well. But what I think is really interesting is the consumer aspect of this, when all these platforms originated, they weren't big business, and now they are.Consumers are also wizening up to the fact their data is being harvested, and they're going to turn away. I know so many people who have said I'm not using Facebook anymore. I've taken the app off my phone because they're worried about it.So, as, you know, business is catering to consumers, that's one concern as well as the regulation side of it as well.BARTIROMO: How easy is it to take it off your phone? For a little while, we were talking about this and you couldn't delete if you tried.ROSCHELLE: But you can't delete your account, but I know so many people, and I am guilty as is somebody to my right. That we are not using Facebook, but we are using Instagram, right?DEANGELIS: Yes. Well, they're all and WhatsApp. They're all together.HILSENRATH: We are following our children, right, because they abandoned Facebook a long time ago and are all over Instagram.ROSCHELLE: And Snapchat and WhatsApp, exactly.DEANGELIS: I'll tell you something, I did a little experiment, I turned the microphones off on these platforms and looked to see how the advertising, the targeted advertising actually changed, and I found that the ads were less targeted to me.BARTIROMO: Wow.DEANGELIS: I'm not saying there is a connection there, but it definitely was something that made me think twice.BARTIROMO: That is really scary that they are listening to you so closely and then targeting ads at you just from the microphone. Whoa.ROSCHELLE: I have a case study, I walked into my house last week, I said to my wife, our Polaris, that's the thing that cleans the bottom of the pool, is broken, because the wheel came off and there was an ad in my phone the following morning for Polaris.BARTIROMO: And all you did was say the word --ROSCHELLE: I said the word, Polaris. It could've been anything.BARTIROMO: Do you have echo or anything in --ROSCHELLE: No, I don't have. I don't have any of those chat box, and so it just had to be my phone.BARTIROMO: So, it was your phone?ROSCHELLE: Yes.BARTIROMO: That's incredible, actually. A senior Facebook executive told the BBC that the company favors government regulation when it comes to offensive content. So they are basically saying, look, we welcome it, bring it on, they have to say that at this point. At this point, they are up against the corner. They know regulation is coming.HILSENRATH: Right, right. And now, the only effort is to manage how tough it's going to be, how deep it's going to be.ROSCHELLE: But history has proven that if your industry is going to be regulated, there's two ways to deal with it, you can ignore it and fight it and resist, or you can get ahead of it and then try to craft what the regulation is, and that's what they're doing. It's a smart strategy.BARTIROMO: This Devin Nunes lawsuit is interesting because if he wins, then it could mean that these companies are regulated differently, in fact, they are looked at as media companies because part of Devin Nunes' lawsuit is that Twitter is a content publisher.DEANGELIS: Yes, and absolutely, I mean, you think about it every day as soon as you go to publish something there. You're putting it out there. You have a platform to do that and I think, you know, people are thinking twice about it, but the question that I would have is how can they regulate it? There's so much content, what can they actually really do?BARTIROMO: Well, these companies say, no, we're not media companies, we are an internet company. We are just giving you the forum to talk back and forth. But, in fact, there is a lot of content --HILSENRATH: But do they want to embrace the idea that they are media companies and use the first amendment to their -- to bring it to their own defense, I'm not sure how that strategy fits into what they are thinking about. But, you know, they could argue that they shouldn't be regulated because they are media companies.BARTIROMO: That's a good point. We'll take a short break. When we come back, FedEx is under pressure this morning, the shipping giant slashing prices to keep up with the competition. Then, no case of the Mondays here, we're taking a look at how to keep employees happy, in this new era of work, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures indicating a higher opening this morning for stock prices, despite rising tensions with Iran, joining me right now, Optimal Capital Director of Strategy and Market Analyst, Frances Newton Stacy, Frances, it is good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.FRANCES NEWTON STACY, DIRECTOR OF PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, OPTIMAL CAPITAL: Hey, great to see you, Maria, thank you.BARTIROMO: You know, interesting that you've got all of this unrest, whether it is the uncertainty about China or the unrest having to do with Iran and one of the most important stories for these markets right here, cover story of the Journal, bond yields plunging, signaling unease this morning.And last week, we saw the 10-year drop below 2 percent, what do you think yields are telling us, Frances?STACY: Well, I think the yields are telling us that the truth about decelerating growth, decelerating inflation in the economy is definitely slowing down. But what's so fascinating, as you say, is that it's not being priced into the indices.And just that tells me that volatility coming up against, you know, all- time highs, taking up all-time highs, and volatility being so low, is actually suppressed by the expectation, number one, for a China deal to wiggle its way through and also the expectation for the Fed to cut rates.BARTIROMO: So, it's all that uncertainty, Jon, typically when you see yields this low, it indicates, perhaps, a recession is on the horizon. Does it always indicate that, though?HILSENRATH: So, what we've got is something called an inverted yield curve where long term interest rates are lower than short term interest rates. And basically, what -- that the market thinks the Fed is going to have to cut short-term interest rates because they are too high, the Fed tends to cut short term interest rates when we're heading towards a recession to get the economy going.So, it is a troublesome sign. And I think it's one of the reasons why we've seen the Fed shift its stance dramatically in the last few months. They are now talking about a cut -- the market is pricing in a high probability of a cut at the next meeting in July.BARTIROMO: And which is why the Federal Reserve was such in focus last week. The Fed, last week, decided to hold rates steady, even though the President has called for a rate cut, the President denied that he actually threatened to demote Federal Reserve Chairman, Jay Powell.He never actually said that. He was answering a question from a reporter. Here's what the President said about all of that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHUCK TODD, CURRENT MODERATOR, NBC'S MEET THE PRESS: Do you threat to demote him? Do you think that's had an impact?DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I didn't ever threaten to demote him.TODD: There have been some talks that you might demote him to the number two slot.TRUMP: I'd be able to do that if I wanted, but I haven't suggested that.TODD: That's not a threat --TRUMP: No, it's not.TODD: -- that's just a reminder that you can?TRUMP: No, no. I have the right to do that, but I haven't said that. What he has done is 50 billion a month in quantitative tightening, that's ridiculous. What he's done is he raised interest rates too fast.TODD: Are you worried it's going to hurt --TRUMP: I've been proven right.TODD: -- your re-election?TRUMP: I think the economy is so strong. We're going to bull through it. But I'm not happy with his actions. No, I don't think he's done a good job. I think this, if he didn't raise rates, Obama had very low rates, so Obama was playing with funny money. I wasn't. I'm playing with the real stuff.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Frances, your reaction to what the President has said about Jay Powell?STACY: Well, I think it's very interesting. I think he thought he'd tightened too much too quickly, and I actually agree with that assessment as we saw the markets selloff in December. The thing that the Fed is really contending with is that we only have 2-1/2 percent or 250 basis points to lower rates should we have problem with the economy.So, they have every incentive to try and get those rates up. But I agree with your other guest, they can't really do it. You know, the inverted yield curve, they're going to have to go ahead and cut rates. Although, I do not think that we're going to see a rate cut in July, unless they stop producing the balance sheet, reducing the balance sheets, putting the brakes on, rate cuts are stepping on the gas.And I don't think they're going to do this two things simultaneously because they're not going to negate their own tools with only 250 basis points to play with, so I think we'll see a rate cut in September.BARTIROMO: It's a good point. You don't want to see the executive office, bullying the Federal Reserve, I get that. But you have to also look at what Jay Powell has done here, because we were talking about three-rate hikes just six months ago and the unwinding of the balance sheet. Obviously, he was misguided.HILSENRATH: Well, you know, the Fed misread where the economy was going. They expected a slowdown, what they didn't expect was an inflation was going to stay so slow, and that the global economy was going to slowdown.I just want to raise one point, in that clip, the President said he's got a right to demote the Federal Reserve chairman, that's not at all clear in the law, and Jay Powell has said that if the President asked him to leave his job, he won't do it, so if the President amps this up, this could be the kind of thing that ends up in court.BARTIROMO: Well, I was uncomfortable with reporting last week, that the President said he wanted to demote him in the first place, because he really never said that. He was answering a reporter's question. The reporter said, do you want to demote him? He goes, we'll see how he does or we'll see what happens, which is what he says to a lot of things.ROSCHELLE: One thing that's interesting is this Fed has been incredibly transparent, right? And there are three Fed governors/president speaking this week, including Powell, a matter of fact, tomorrow, so it'd be interesting in the wake of all of this and more economic news and $13 trillion worth of global debt with negative yields, what they have to say about this.And the FOMC themselves are very divided about raising versus lowering, so it'd be interesting to see about the (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: We've got a lot of (INAUDIBLE) to read, actually. Frances, before you go, real quick, we've got the GDP number out this week, your thoughts on what we are going to hear from all these economic data in the next couple of days, consumer confidence out tomorrow, GDP out on Thursday before the G20 meeting on Friday.STACY: Yes. I think it's just going to continue to show that growth is decelerating, which I think is going to give Trump more impetus to put pressure on the Fed.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Great to talk with you, Frances, thanks.STACY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Frances Newton Stacy joining us there. Coming up, crisis at the border, lawmakers skeptical after President Trump gave them a deadline to change the asylum law. Former ICE director Tom Homan weighs in on that when we come right back.And then, Wal-Mart cracks down on shoplifting, a look at how it's using Artificial Intelligence to get that job done. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 24th. We have breaking news right now. Russia is saying that deployment of U.S. missiles near Russian borders could lead to a crisis comparable to the Cuban Missile Crisis. That's according to a Russian news agency this morning.Plus, a new threat from Iran. A top official warning Tehran is capable of shooting down more American drones. Calling the United States, the enemy. It comes as the White House plans new sanctions on Iran today.Markets are rallying this morning, take a look at Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading. Futures indicating a gain of 65 points on the Dow, S&P is up eight, and the Nasdaq up 28. Friday, markets closed down slightly. The Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S&P we're poised for record highs before Iran tensions cut into earlier gains. At the close, the Dow is down 34, S&P down three, and the Nasdaq lower by 19.In Europe this morning, the Indices are mixed. FT-100 is up two points. CAC Quarante in Paris is down 11. And the DAX Index in Germany lowered by 70.In Asia overnight, we had slight gains across the board as China confirm that President Xi is headed to the G20, where he is expected to meet with President Trump. As you see, the Shanghai Composite was up a quarter of a percent.Wal-Mart fighting theft with A.I. The retailer turning to cameras powered by Artificial Intelligence to keep a close eye on checkouts. And FedEx is cutting rates this morning. Find out why the shipping giant is cutting prices on day -- its two-day air service. The stock is down this morning by 1-1/2 percent.Employee happiness. What employers can do to empower their workforce? All those stories coming up this Monday morning. But our top story this half an hour, the border crisis.President Trump announcing plans to delay the deportations of millions of illegal immigrants in order to have more time to work with Congress. On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES", I spoke with House Intel Committee ranking member Devin Nunes about the wait.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to the president's move to wait two weeks to see if the Democrats actually approach this issue?REP. DEVIN NUNES (D-CA): I think what he's doing is the Democrats asked him if he would delay this? He said, "OK, I'll give you two weeks." Now, remember the Democrats have been in office for six months now, they have yet to move a comprehensive immigration bill. And I think that's what the American people need to focus on is the people that they elect have responsibilities to pass legislation.They can't just oppose what the president wants to do because as you know, you've been at the border, you know that it's a -- it's a disaster down there. It is a humanitarian crisis. And this is a problem that could easily be fixed if we wanted to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, Tom Homan. Tom, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Are you expecting any action on these issues? We know that because of the Flores agreement, because of the asylum standards, we have all of these people crossing the border. We're talking about a million people expected, a million this year. HOMAN: No, I'm not optimistic. I think the president's smart to give him -- you know, giving opportunity to come to the table and present something that's -- you know, that's appropriate. But look, as Nunes just said, look, they've had this issue for a year and a half. Meaning that the Congress where they haven't closed the loopholes that caused this crisis to begin with.Women -- 31 percent of women being raped. Children are dying. That wasn't enough to make them move. What was the final stroke that broke the cameras back? ISIS going to go and rest illegal aliens who've been ordering moved by a judge. That is what the Democrats brought -- that's what brought them to the table. Not the other stuff.This, again, I think it's very telling they're more interest in protecting illegal aliens who've been ordering moved by a judge. They're more interest in protecting them than securing this border. And this latest offered by Nancy Pelosi proves it.DEANGELIS: Tom, the president has used unconventional tactics to work on this issue. But offering this two weeks to the Democrats. Do you think that they'll take that opportunity and try to move the ball forward?HOMAN: I think they'll put something on the table but it won't be anything meaningful. I mean, do I think they're going to change the asylum laws were 90 percent of the claimants are creating fraud? No.Do I think they'll going to allow us to detain families long enough to see a judge? No. Do I think they're going to treat children of Central America the same way you treat children from Mexico, once it's determined you're not a victim of trafficking, you can be returned? No. I think they're going to throw money at the humanitarian crisis, which is -- which is a good point, but they're going to do nothing to secure this border in a meaningful way.BARTIROMO: But, why not? I mean, Tom, why not? We're looking at these pictures of the children that I encountered when I went to the border about a month and a half ago now. It was incredible. First of all, they were all sick. They had been walking, hitchhiking for months. They needed to go to the hospital many of them.These two over there, they were sisters, they're holding each other's hands. One was six, one was eight. They said that their mother -- they were with their mother but their mother said she was going to get something to eat and then left. And -- you know, she -- they haven't seen their mother.I mean, I don't know how true that is, I don't know what the story is, but there's obviously a renting of children program going on in Guatemala, which we've heard about. How much are mothers getting for their kids for that just smugglers could take the kids over the border and then send them back, and then do it again?HOMAN: What is -- it is happening. There's intelligent enforce -- there's criminal investigations being conducted by ICE. It goes from a several hundred -- several hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars.But your question why won't they fix this? That's a good question. I mean, again, children are dying, women are being raped. They -- you see the images on the southern border. You got Democrats calling these concentration camps, but they haven't offered up one fix for the crisis.They have -- they haven't offered one idea. The president actually put an immigration plan on the table. They're not even talking about it. So, you know, this is politics. They want this president to fail on his border security promise. This is about the election, this is about power, this is about resisting this president.ROSCHELLE: Hey, Tom. Good morning, Michele Roschelle. In the list of things that you articulated before from pathway to citizenship, DACA, chain migration, and so forth. Is there anyone element where there could be sort of a kernel of bipartisanship to build on? Or is this just becomes so tribal and not wanting to give the president to win on it for any reason that we're just not going to make any progress in these two weeks?HOMAN: I don't see any bipartisanship. I see one thing. I think both sides care about the health and safety of women and children. I think the border (INAUDIBLE) are doing the best job they can. They don't want these children be sick, they don't want these women to be raped.So, I think what they can agree all on that, that there is a humanitarian crisis. But what they don't agree on is this a humanitarian crisis has caused a national security crisis. Border Patrols already said, 46 percent of (INAUDIBLE) are not working like taking care of the vulnerable populations, which means that cartels are moving drugs and bad people to unprotected parts of the border.So, I got -- I got -- I'm not optimistic about this at all, but I agree, the president given an opportunity. From once again he can say, I gave you an opportunity, you could -- the three things I just mentioned, TVPRA, asylum, and the -- and the Flores settlement. That can be fixed in one day. They don't need two weeks.So, let's see if they're serious about -- you know, protecting these women, protecting the children, and stop -- and stop enticing them to come to this countries by closing the loophole.BARTIROMO: So, so wait, you were the head of ICE. You say this can be fixed within a couple of weeks.HOMAN: Absolutely. If they came to the table and fix asylum laws to make it make sense, so, you -- it's not 90 percent fraud. If they just change - - if the families want to come and claim asylum, fine.Let us detain them long enough to see a judge. Back in 2015, I did that. And we kept about 40-45 days, and guess what, 90 percent loss of cases. We fill planes full of families the send himself, and the border numbers went down.BARTIROMO: Yes.HOMAN: It wasn't until the Flores and some of agreement said, well, I'm not going to let you hold them long enough to see a judge, we're going to release him after 20 days. That's where -- that's where the surge started.HILSENRATH: Tom, how does the rise of sanctuary cities affect ISIS ability to enforce these deportation cases and the whole strategy of dealing with these cases?HOMAN: It makes it very difficult. First of all, sanctuary cities is another enticement where people, you know, the bankroll criminal cartels against the United States, will then get into sanctuary city where they think they'd be protective mice.Even they get arrested in county jail. That's another enticement that brings these people to this country. But it's hard. When local law enforcement who want to do the right thing, they want to work well in law enforcement, but the -- either the mayor or the -- or the governor has passed legislation, said you're not going to do it.So, it makes it hard to be -- it makes -- it makes ICE see job harder. They could arrest these people into county jail. That to get arrested rather than going to the neighborhoods, and putting himself at risk, put the immigrant community at risk. Because when you go out to the community rest the bad guy, chance are you going to find others, others that weren't even on our radar.So, sanctuary cities are dangerous for immigrant communities and it's dangerous for men and women advice.BARTIROMO: Tom, you make a lot of important points. Thanks so much.HOMAN: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Tom Homan joining us there. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart is turning to artificial intelligence at the checkout line. Cheryl Casone with headlines now. Cheryl.CASONE: Probably, that this was coming, Maria. The retailer is installing A.I. powered cameras of more than 1,000 stores. They say that the cameras are going to help identify checkout scanning errors, and also failures. The system notifies checkout attendants when a theft issue arises. Which shares a Wal-Mart up about 20 percent, so far, of this year.Well, FedEx reportedly slashing prices in the face of rising competition to fill its planes. The Wall Street Journal says that the company is offering discounts to some of its express network customers.This comes as FedEx is trying to take business away from UPS. FedEx ending a shipping contract with Amazon later this month. That's already been announced. The company reports earnings after the closing bell tomorrow. There is the year to date chart of FedEx.Slurpees on the beach. Yes, (INAUDIBLE). My blast story. Convenient store 7-Eleven becoming more convenient. The chain is expanding its delivery service to public places.The customers can now order a Slurpee, have it delivered to more than 2,000, 7-Eleven hot spots, including Central Park, obviously. Venice Beach in Los Angeles, all to starts today. Customers need to download the 7NOW app to get the service.My biggest question, will my Slurpees still be icy cold on the beach, but we shall see.BARTIROMO: Well, yes, that is a good point, after the whole delivery, yes.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: For, at least, we now know that we could feed our Slurpee -- want to download,DEANGELIS: And it's another app. They'll track your location, they'll know exactly what you're doing in, Maria.BARTIROMO: Shut the microphone.ROSCHELLE: Can we get them delivered right here after a couple more cups of coffee?BARTIROMO: Oh, maybe, we'll have sure there's a hotspot.ROSCHELLE: Cheryl, can we get -- yes.HILSENRATH: By the way, the FedEx story is really interesting to me. You know, it's another sign that there's just no inflation in this economy. When -- you know, we talk about the economy growing fast and unemployment so low, everyone is expecting prices to start rising, and FedEx is out there cutting them.BARTIROMO: That's a great point. It's a great point.ROSCHELLE: And to tie the story, and the more negative yields around the world, the stronger our (INAUDIBLE) gets, and the less inflation we have.HILSENRATH: Right.ROSCHELLE: So, all time together.BARTIROMO: There you go. Yes, all right, coming up, CBD crackdown. One city ready to take cannabis products off a store shelves in just days. The threat to business, coming up.And then, work hard, work happy. How you can start off your week with a bang and your boss can help? Back in a minute with that.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The Hawaii Star Advertiser reporting this morning, NTSB opens probe into Dillingham Air Field plane crash, 11 people killed in that crash. The National Transportation Safety Board says it would be looking at evidence like log books, weather conditions, runway conditions and the plane's maintenance record to figure out why the plane went down.The San Francisco Chronicle this morning reports BET Awards honor Mary J. Blige, Nipsy Hussle, and Tyler Perry -- the 2019 awards features a number of pop and rap stars dominating the charts but the show belonged to artists viewed as icons, including singer Mary J. Blige; filmmaker, Tyler Perry; and late rapper, Nipsy Hussle.And the New York Post this morning reporting that New York City is banning CBD stores. CBD has stores (INAUDIBLE) options; the clock is now ticking for retailers that sell goods infused with CBD. A New York City Health Department ban is slate to go into effect, July 1, those not obeying this new rule will start getting fined in the fall. Business is now weighing other options.These are some of the stories across the country. Of course, we've got a major week this week not just economy data but also the G-20, where the president will meet with President Xi -- any expectations in terms of what takes place here, Jackie?DEANGELIS: I think that he's going to have a constructive conversation to set the stage for something to happen, but I think anybody who thinks something's going to happen this week per se, might be getting a little ahead of what's actually, you know, happening --BARTIROMO: Yes, because these are important issues that they reneged on, like the theft of intellectual property, they don't want to make that a law, that's against the law to steal the intellectual property from the west.HILSENRATH: They don't have enough time to get talks going again to be able to come to a deal, so I don't think anyone should have expectations that they're going to have a deal coming out of this meeting. I mean, what it looks like is going to happen is an agreement to start talking again and maybe something happens down the road.ROSCHELLE: But that's progress, because right now the talks are stalled altogether. So, the two of them can get the train back on tracks. I think that the market will perceive that as good news.HILSENRATH: If they can get it back on track. But then, you have to wonder if they don't get it resolved say, six months down the road, does the president say, that's 300 billion tariffs on another on another 300 --DEANGELIS: He just might. He just might. I think that's why he's holding onto that card, to play it potentially down the road. But overall, I think the market thinks end of the summer, that could be, you know, good timing.HILSENRATH: You know, the other variable is that after end of summer, we're moving into an -- really moving into an election cycle and how does that play into the president's calculations on tariffs and how they affect the economy and all this other stuff.ROSCHELLE: One thing that's interesting is there bite for being tough on China. So, it's an interesting card for the president to play as he's going up against a handful of Democrat opponents to show himself as being tough.BARTIROMO: No one has done it before this.HILSENRATH: On the one hand, there's support for being tough on China. On the other, we have global economy that's slowing that looks like it's affecting the U.S. economy, and China is at the center of that global slowdown. So, you know, he wants a strong economy going into this election year, so it's a tough call.BARTIROMO: Yes, but a strong economy is also strong national security, right? And this is a national security issue. Mike Pompeo -- Mike Pence, the president, have been trying to communicate to the public that this has (INAUDIBLE). Let's face it. China had been pumping out submarines, they've been building up their military, they want to overtake the U.S. as largest military. Somebody said to me this weekend, the U.S. has duty to stop China from doing -- from becoming the largest military power. A duty, because who wants a communist country dominating the world? That's what this is about.DEANGELIS: Yes.ROSCHELLE: And the think about for generations, all of our wars were about stopping communism.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break, when we come -- yes?HILSENRATH: I was just -- this is a different kind of communist country than the Soviet Union. China is very much engaged in the global economy in ways that it wasn't --BARTIROMO: Are you -- you want China -- you're not uncomfortable with the Chinese having the largest military and the most dominant military in the world.HILSENRATH: That was the next point I was going to make, you know, is that good for us or bad for us, that's the part I can't say.BARTIROMO: All right. We will take a break. When we come back, optimizing employee happiness; how to start workweek off right with the help of your boss. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The case of the Mondays, headed back to work after the weekend can be rough if not sad. Happiness at the office is something more employees want and more employers are looking to give them in order to keep them for the long haul. Joining us right now is the CEO and Founder of Brightfox, Deena Fox. Deena, great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.DEENA FOX, CEO AND FOUNDER, BRIGHTFOX: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Tell us what the goal is and how to achieve happiness for employees?FOX: Yes, I think happiness is the result of employers creating a great employee experience. And I think that something that employers and employees need to keep in mind is that the employment relationship is like any other relationship in our lives and it requires engagement from both sides.BARTIROMO: Do you see that throughout corporate America? When you worked in human resources departments at Amazon, you've worked at Jet.com, Hugo Boss, Oscar Health, tell us about your experiences and what you've taken away from the companies working there in H.R.FOX: Yes. I mean, these are companies in different industries, different stages of growth, different sizes -- anywhere from 90 people to, you know, hundreds of thousands of people. And I think that over last nearly two decades I found that people generally want three things, to find meaning and purpose at work. One they have to find that the work that they're doing is meaningful, that they actually enjoy it, that they leverage the skill set that they have today to contribute to their role. They have to have opportunities to learn and grow. And, third, they have to feel a sense of community and belonging at work and I think in each of those areas, the employer has to focus on the employment experience and really ensure that people feel that they can optimize their performance in a way of sense of accomplishment for them.HILSENRATH: Deena, what's the biggest mistake that managers make in managing their workers? What do you see people doing over and over again that they need to change?FOX: I think it starts with not setting clear expectations up front and then when things sort of start to fester --DEANGELIS: Avoiding conflict?FOX: Right, avoiding conflict. And I think that, you know, your question about managers is really on point in terms of that correlation between workplace, happiness and satisfaction, because managers are the single biggest variable in the experience that people have in the company. And so, I think really, companies have to think about how to take that variability and streamline the experience. And, of course, I think, you do in great part through leveraging technology like we do in so many parts of our lives.ROSCHELLE: One of the things we mentioned here -- and you've said about (INAUDIBLE) workplace, and how much of this -- real quickly -- how much of this is physical, like the workspace as opposed to intangible in terms of experience?FOX: That's also a great question. So, employee experience is a term that employers and H.R. leaders use pretty regularly now, but it's sort of staying at this really superficial level and it is a combination of all three of those things. So, it's a thoughtfully curated program that incorporates the physical work space, the perks and benefits of the company, the core H.R. processes as well as that whole sense of community and belonging.DEANGELIS: You know, I wonder how you could advise employees to communicate better with managers.FOX: I think that it goes back to my earlier point that they have to understand that they have a responsibility to engage, sometimes I think people in the workplace, they tend to keep things inside or my manager --BARTIROMO: We take it for granted.FOX: My manager didn't ask me for.BARTIROMO: Deena, it's great to get your insight.FOX: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.DEANGELIS: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Deena Fox. Stay with us. We'll be right back.Load-Date: June 24, 2019End of Document

DAFOH Calls Upon U.S. Congress to Investigate Genocide of Falun Gong in ChinaPR NewswireJune 19, 2019 Wednesday 1:56 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 475 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, June 19, 2019 BodyPR Newswire The United States Congress must act immediately on the findings of theIndependent Tribunal on Forced Organ Harvesting that the killing of detainees in China for their organs has continued despite the regime's promises to the contrary, according to leading human rights organization Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH). The tribunal, chaired by former international war crimes prosecutor Sir Geoffrey Nice, released its final judgment on June 17th."The tribunal's judgment demonstrates beyond all doubt that China is continuing to kill prisoners of conscience for their organs. We believe that forced organ harvesting in China is linked to other prolific abuses of this target group and amounts to a deliberate campaign of genocide against Falun Gong practitioners," said Dr. Torsten Trey, executive director of DAFOH.The tribunal's findings recognize that some elements of a genocide are "clearly established" and explicitly invites further investigation concerning genocide. DAFOH echoes the tribunal's call for further investigations and urges Congress to launch formal proceedings to determine the extent of the practice and the degree to which it constitutes genocide.The tribunal's report coincides with the one-year anniversary of anacademic article, co-authored by members of DAFOH, which first described the organ harvesting campaign as a 'cold genocide' against Falun Gong practitioners in China.One characteristic of a 'cold genocide' is that the eradication of the targeted group occurs in a slow-moving manner, said Trey. The Chinese government's framing of Falun Gong as a 'cult' has misled the Chinese people and the international community preventing unbiased investigations of the genocide carried out against practitioners. "The campaign to label Falun Gong as a 'cult' has become part of the cold genocide, as it tries to conceal the eradication of the group," said Trey.Falun Gong is known worldwide as a peaceful, orthodox Buddhist Qigong practice.

NEW APTECH TARIFF PORTAL DELIVERS THE GOODS ON TARIFFSStates News ServiceApril 18, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1822 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: RESTON, VA BodyThe following information was released by the Association for Print Technologies (APTech&#8480;):Association for Print Technologies Opposes Trump Tariffs: Creates Information PortalOpposition to Trump Administration tariffs on aluminum, steel, Chinese products and Canadian uncoated groundwood (UGW) paper has become the top priority of Association for PRINT Technologies (APTechSM) government affairs advocacy. Individually, and even more so collectively, these tariffs add needless and damaging costs to technology suppliers, printers and other down-steam customers, and threaten to put a drag on the overall U.S. economy.In response, APTech has appealed to the President , met with Commerce Department officials, submitted testimony to the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee , and allied itself with several multi-industry coalitions that are seeking congressional action to staunch the onslaught of these ill-advised tariffs, which are a tax on American businesses and consumers. To communicate its actions in response to these tariffs, APTech has established this Tariff Information Portal on its website to track tariff-related developments and receive input from APTech members and their customers.Section 232 Tariffs on Aluminum and SteelAfter an investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerc (DOC) cited national security concerns, in March 2018 President Trump issued proclamations under the authority of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (9704 and 9705) imposing a 10% tariff on aluminum and 25% tariff on steel imported into the United States. But, before the tariffs were imposed, the President suspended them until May 1 for the EU, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, and said Canada and Mexico could be excluded if North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations succeeded. Countries with security relationships with the U.S. were offered a "satisfactory alternative" to the tariff if one could be found, and agreements were reached with Argentina, Australia and Brazil. On April 30 the President delayed the tariff one last time until June 1 when it was imposed on the EU, Canada and Mexico.Overall, eight U.S. trading partnersthe EU, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia and Turkeyhave noticed retaliation against the United States potentially impacting approximately $39 billion in U.S. exports, including a high proportion of U.S. manufactured goods, from steel and aluminum products to motorcycles and vehicles to processed food and distilled spirits.Section 232 Tariffs Exclusion ProcessIn March the Commerce Department also announced a protocol for seeking an exclusion from the tariff for any aluminum or steel article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality and based on specific national security considerations. But, requests for relief are restricted to directly affected parties located in the United States. More than 24,000 exclusion requests for steel and aluminum products have been made public thus far, but far fewer have been granted.Congressional objections to this process have been raised on due process and procedural fairness grounds. The House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee held a hearing (see APTech's submission to the hearing) during which the flawed process received deserved criticism. In its submission APTech strongly opposed the Trump tariffs on aluminum and steel, because they needlessly increase costs for printing technology suppliers and their customers, which greatly outweigh any benefits to a narrower segment of the economy that supplies aluminum and steel. This is especially egregious where no domestic source exits. Printing plate manufacturers' cost have gone up as have plate prices for printers while suppliers pursue exclusion requests.Section 301 Chinese TariffsIn August 2017, President Trump directed the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to investigate Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. At the conclusion of this investigation USTR determined that the acts, policies, and practices of the Chinese government related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce resulting in harm to the U.S. economy of at least $50 billion per year.1 In a March 2018 response to the investigation's conclusions, the President directed USTR to: (1) open a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute on Chinese licensing practices, (2) propose measures restricting Chinese investment "aimed at obtaining key U.S. Technologies", and (3) propose 25% Ad Valorem Duties on imported Chinese goods "with an annual trade value commensurate with the harm caused to the U.S. economy." 2In April 2018 USTR announced a proposed list of 1,333 tariff lines for which Chinese goods would be subject to additional duties of 25%. After public hearings and a public comment period, this list was narrowed to just over 1,100 lines and broken into two distinct sets. The first set, List 1, is 818 lines accounting for ~$34 billion of Chinese imports; the second set, "List 2," contains 284 proposed tariff lines accounting for ~$16 billion of Chinese imports. The list 1 tariffs went into effect July 6 while the list 2 products are currently in a public comment period, awaiting implementation.After tariffs went into effect on the original list of Chinese imports (list 1), China announced corresponding tariffs on 545 goods,3 imported into China from the U.S. from sectors ranging from automobiles to agriculture, which also went into effect on July 6. Additionally, they announced a separate set of 114 goods from sectors like chemical products, medical equipment, and energy products, which were proposed, but not yet officially implemented. In response to this, President Trump instructed the USTR to propose an additional set of goods, "List 3" accounting for roughly $200 billion of Chinese imports, which originally would have had a 10% duty added, but now may have a 25% tariff imposed. The third list of goods is expected to have public hearings and an open comment section in August. Each of the three lists include printing technologies.1,2 USTR Section 301 Fact Sheet3 Zhong, Raymond. "China Strikes Back at Trump's Tariffs, but Its Consumers Worry". The New York Times. 6 Jul. 2018.APTech Response to Proposed Section 301 China TariffsIn response to the proposed Section 301 tariffs on certain Chinese products, APTech joined other interested associations in their opposition to China's unfair trade practices and disagreed with the use of tariffs as leverage against them. A comprehensive USTR Section 301 Report rightly identified the key issues that U.S. businesses face in China. In a letter to United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, APTech and its free-trade allies have strongly recommended the Trump Administration use the results of the report to consult closely with industry stakeholders and Congress to develop a joint approach that will address these longstanding commercial issues within China. Only through extensive collaboration and alignment can the Administration develop and execute a strategic policy to effectively address our shared issues of critical concern in China. A continued escalation of a trade war will not benefit either country.Canadian UGW Paper DutiesIf aluminum, steel and Chinese product tariffs weren't enough, a single paper supplier, NORPAC, alleged that Canadian imports of uncoated groundwood paper (UGW), which is used for newsprint, directories, book publishing, and circulars, are being subsidized or shipments are being dumped into the United States, putting downward pressure on price.In September 2017, the International Trade Commission (ITC) made a preliminary determination that there was a "reasonable indication" of injury or threat of injury, which is a very low bar for moving forward. In January 2018 the Department of Commerce (DOC) released its preliminary determination assessing countervailing (anti-subsidy) duties on UGW imports from Canada. These duties ranged from 4.4 to 9.9% with an average of 6.53%. In March, DOC released preliminary anti-dumping duties that ranged as high as 22%. This means that some Canadian imports of newsprint are being assessed new taxes of up to 32%right now at the borderas the investigation in this case continues. The duties are already causing a price shock and a disruption in the marketplace.Although in this case their application is not warranted, antidumping and countervailing duty laws provide American businesses and workers with an internationally accepted mechanism to seek relief from the harmful effects of the unfair pricing of imports into the United States. Commerce currently maintains 456 antidumping and countervailing duty orders which provide relief to American companies and industries impacted by unfair trading practices.On August 2 the DOC announced its affirmative conclusion in the investigations and issued slightly revised rates for anti-dumping and countervailing duties. Though lower, the revised rates are still damaging to the industry. The next step in the process is a determination in mid-September by the U.S. ITC of whether the Canadian imports have damaged the domestic paper industry. If the ITC finds in the affirmative, the duties will remain in place; conversely, a finding of no damage terminates the investigation and repeals the duties.A majority of the U.S. newsprint manufacturers and even the trade association for the U.S. paper industrythe American Forest and Paper Associationoppose the NORPAC petitions for import duties on Canadian newsprint. A decades-long shift toward digital platforms is the chief disruptor of U.S. newsprint producers, not unfair pricing from Canada. Since 2000, the demand for newsprint in North America has declined by 75%. The newsprint tariffs that are now being assessed are harming newspapers, printers and the U.S. newsprint industry. Higher costs of 25 to 30% are forcing publishers and printers to take steps to reduce production, print fewer pages, reduce distribution, and shift more of their news and advertising content to digital platforms.The paper industry and its allies in the newspaper, printing and supplier community, including APTech, have been fighting these ill-advised duties collectively through the Stop Tariffs on Printers and Publishers (STOPP) Coalition. STOPP has been successful in garnering much congressional opposition to the DOC duties, both in testimony before the U.S. ITC, and in support of the PRINT Act (S. 2835 / H.R. 6031), which would put a pause on the new tariffs until the ITC studies and reports on the impact of the tariffs on the printing and publishing industry.Stay up to date with APTechYes, please keep me informed and up to date about what's happening at APTech and PRINT 19!Load-Date: April 19, 2019End of Document

Here's what happened to the last Chinese tech company that got the 'death penalty.'China's ambassador to Pakistan, Lijian Zhao, tweeted a joke on Monday about Trump's executive order. "Look at the logo of Huawei. It has cut APPLE into pieces..." He included a photo of a cut-up Apple for comparison:Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1130563675725672448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw BREAKING: It has been just revealed why @realDonaldTrump hated a private company from China so much that it went so far by announcing a national emergency. Look at the logo of Huawei.

Apple is the third-largest, and was overtaken by Huawei in March, according to International Data Corp.This isn't the first time the logos have been compared. 9 to 5 Mac reports that the joke has become a feature of the "boycott Apple" movement in China.But the joke backfired somewhat when people pointed out that the tweet appears to have been sent from an iPhone, as when viewed in Tweetdeck it displays "Twitter for iPhone."This isn't the first time a Huawei fan has tweeted support for the company from an iPhone. In January, two Huawei employees were demoted and had their pay docked for tweeting a New Years' greeting from the official company account on an iPhone.Huawei's leadership also doesn't seem adverse to using Apple products. CFO Meng Wanzhou was carrying a bunch of Apple devices when she was arrested in December, and CEO Ren Zhengfei            told Chinese state television this week that he admires the company and buys iPhones for his family when abroad.NOW WATCH: Watch Google's I/O 2019 event in 7 minutesSee Also:• Huawei's CEO says he admires Apple and buys his family iPhones when they are not in China• Huawei's torment in the US could be about to backfire, dealing a stinging blow to Apple• THE TECH COLD WAR: Everything that's happened in the new China-US tech conflict involving Google, Huawei, Apple, and TrumpSEE ALSO: Huawei's CEO says he admires Apple and buys his family iPhones when they are not in ChinaLoad-Date: May 22, 2019End of Document

Vodafone Confirms Security Flaws In Huawei EquipmentLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsApril 30, 2019 Tuesday 9:52 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 668 wordsBody Vodafone Group PLC on Tuesday confirmed it found vulnerabilities in network equipment supplied by Huawei as the debate continues over the presence of the Chinese firm in communications networks.First reported by Bloomberg News, the UK telecoms firm is said to have discovered the flaws between 2009 and 2012 in internet routers and other equipment used by its Italian business.The "hidden back doors" could have allowed Huawei to access users' home internet networks, the report claimed.Vodafone confirmed the issues but disputed aspects of the report, claiming the flaws were diagnostic tools used to monitor the state of a network that had failed to be removed and could not be used to access a user's network."The issues in Italy identified in the Bloomberg story were all resolved and date back to 2011 and 2012," a Vodafone spokesman said."The 'back door' that Bloomberg refers to is Telnet, which is a protocol that is commonly used by many vendors in the industry for performing diagnostic functions. It would not have been accessible from the internet."Bloomberg is incorrect in saying that this 'could have given Huawei unauthorised access to the carrier's fixed-line network in Italy'."In addition, we have no evidence of any unauthorised access. This was nothing more than a failure to remove a diagnostic function after development."The issues were identified by independent security testing, initiated by Vodafone as part of our routine security measures, and fixed at the time by Huawei."The Chinese firm is at the centre of a debate about the company's trustworthiness and whether it should be used at the centre of communications network infrastructure, having reportedly been given the green light by Prime Minister Theresa May to be used in non-essential parts of the UK's upcoming 5G network.Huawei has been the subject of concern for some years because of allegations of close ties to the country's government.Under Chinese law, firms are compelled to "support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work".A deputy assistant secretary at the US State Department, Robert Strayer, said on Monday that Huawei "was not a trusted vendor" and any use of its technology in 5G networks was a risk.And his position was backed by a Conservative member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Bob Seely, who said: "Huawei cannot, by definition, be a trusted vendor. It is required by law to co-operate with Chinese secret services. It is close to, if not part of, the Chinese state."China has achieved great things, and we need to respect it and develop good deep relations with it, but it also has a reputation for wholesale intellectual property theft and state hacking."Its military theory sees warfare as a battle between systems, including communications systems. It takes a very different approach to human rights and human freedoms.Some critics have expressed concerns that Beijing could require the firm to install technological "backdoors" to enable it to spy on or disable Britain's communications network.Huawei has always denied having ties to the state and says it abides by the laws of the countries in which it operates.Founder Ren Zhengfei said earlier this year that Huawei had never been asked to share "improper information" about its partners by the government."I personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me and my company would not answer to such requests," he said."No law in China requires any company to install mandatory back doors."In a statement on the Vodafone report, Huawei said: "We were made aware of historical vulnerabilities in 2011 and 2012 and they were addressed at the time."Software vulnerabilities are an industry-wide challenge. Like every ICT vendor we have a well-established public notification and patching process, and when a vulnerability is identified we work closely with our partners to take the appropriate corrective action."By Martyn Landi, Press Association Technology Correspondentsource: Press AssociationLoad-Date: May 1, 2019End of Document

An ugly sweater party, a stolen thumb, and international outrage: How a drunken mistake at a Philly museum confounded the art worldPhilly.comApril 12, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 2162 wordsByline: Jeremy Roebuck, Philly.comBodyApril 12--As he crept past a roped-off stanchion, up a ramp and into a darkened room at the Franklin Institute, Michael Rohana knew he was somewhere he wasn’t supposed to be.He had slipped away from his friends while attending an after-hours, “Ugly Sweater” Christmas party at the museum. And using his cellphone as a flashlight, the inebriated 24-year-old began to scan the area around him.Stern gray faces etched from clay leered out from the shadows -- the visages of 10 life-size soldiers from a 2,000-year-old Chinese terra-cotta army.Pretty cool, he thought, grabbing one of figures in a side embrace and mugging for a selfie.As he prepared to sneak back out, Rohana stopped to examine one more: An elaborately armored statue positioned next to an sculpted clay horse. Rohana reached toward the warrior’s hand, grasped its left thumb, and pulled.That decision -- one Rohana later described as a drunken, stupid mistake -- would quickly ripple across the globe. It would spark an international incident with China, expose Pennsylvania’s most popular museum to questions about its security failures and eventually land Rohana in federal court.It would also lead to an unusual trial in Philadelphia featuring testimony from a host of fine art experts eager to challenge each other’s qualifications and, in the process, expose an inherent clash between the subjective world of art appraisals and the justice system’s demand for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.And this week, that one thoughtless act left a jury in Philadelphia flummoxed, unable to reach a verdict after absorbing a week’s worth of testimony and evidence that for the first time revealed the full story behind the prank that grabbed headlines around the world.But as he stood in the darkness two years ago with a broken clay thumb in his hand, Rohana couldn’t have envisioned any of that.He simply shoved the finger into his pocket and ran.“I still don’t know why I did it,” he would tell jurors more than a year later. “I just don’t know what I was thinking.”‘I started to hyperventilate’The morning after the Dec. 21, 2017 party, the seriousness of Rohana’s actions began to sink in.He woke up in his bedroom in his parent’s two-story brick home in Bear, Del., still wearing his jeans and the garish green sweater he had bought the previous day with his mom at a shopping mall. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the thumb.“That’s when a million things started going through my head,” he would later explain. “I started to hyperventilate. I was in my bedroom pacing back and forth. I was scared.”Shoving the digit in a desk drawer, he tried to convince himself the statue was a replica -- that he hadn’t defaced a piece of art nearly as old as Chinese civilization itself. He forced himself to go to work that day at his job as a department store shoe salesman.But Rohana’s panic only grew.As the weeks passed, he found himself constantly Googling “Franklin Institute,” “terra-cotta warrior” and other search terms like “stealing jail time” -- hoping they wouldn’t turn up headlines.His dread became too much to bear. One night, while watching TV with his mother, Michele, he leaned in, clutched her arm and told her everything.They discussed returning the finger to the Franklin Institute. But how? Mail it? Sneak it back into the museum? Or could they anonymously leave it somewhere for Institute staff to find.Ultimately, they did nothing.At the museum, a panic of a different sort had set in.A ‘failure of security’Two weeks after the “Ugly Sweater” party, Susannah Carroll, an assistant director of collections at the Franklin Institute, was making her daily rounds when, for the first time, she noticed the absent thumb.The defaced statue -- a piece known as The Cavalryman -- was one of 10 on loan to the museum from China, each a prized relic fully restored from thousands of fragments unearthed from the tomb of the nation’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.A dominant figure in Chinese history, he united the nation under his rule in the third century B.C. His tomb in central Shaanxi Province took 39 years and a labor force of up to 720,000 workers to complete and is today considered one of the country’s most important historic sites.The Chinese government strictly regulates display and restoration of the terra-cotta warriors housed inside and had spent years reviewing the Franklin Institute’s security protocols and exhibit plans before agreeing to loan the works overseas.Carroll had been on the team the museum sent to China to escort the statues to the United States. She knew instantly that the fallout for its failure to protect them would be severe.Within 24 hours, specialists from the FBI Art Crimes Team arrived. They reviewed ticket stubs, and pored over surveillance camera footage from the night of the party. Days later, they narrowed in on their suspect.On Jan. 13, 2018, a 3:30 a.m. phone call sent the Rohana household scrambling.Agents had just visited the home of a friend who had also been the museum party. They are on their way to your house, he warned.Rohana ran to wake his parents; his mom fainted. Then, came the knock at the door.“Do you have anything you want to turn over to the FBI?” the agents asked.Rohana immediately pointed upstairs, led them to his bedroom and fished the thumb out of the desk drawer where he had kept it in for weeks.“Part of me was kind of relieved,” he would later testify. “It was like the pressure was finally taken off.”But that momentary relief proved fleeting.After his arrest, China sent a delegation to assess the damage and retrieve The Cavalryman’s thumb. Representatives were horrified by the damage. The director of the Shaanxi Cultural Heritage Promotion Center demanded “severe punishment for the perpetrator.”Eager to assuage the upset Chinese, Philadelphia’s City Council that spring passed a unanimous resolution of apology, calling the incident “an embarrassment” and citing a “failure of security” at the museum.Three months after the incident, a federal grand jury indicted Rohana on counts of theft and concealment of an object of cultural heritage -- crimes each punishable by up to a decade prison.A charge fit for an art thiefThe law under which Rohana was charged, known as the federal art theft statute, emerged from a 1994 bill sponsored by Sens. Edward Kennedy and Orrin Hatch in response to the audacious -- and still unsolved -- heist of artwork worth an estimated $500 million from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.U.S. District Judge Petrese B. Tucker, who was assigned to Rohana’s case, had overseen one of the first cases prosecuted under the statute -- a 2001 matter involving the misappropriation of a Civil War officer’s uniform by the former curator of Philadelphia’s Civil War Library and Museum.It has been used less than 20 times in the years since to punish thieves, whose loot included everything from gold bars and valuable coins from museums to historically significant maps.But in each of those cases the motive had been financial gain. Rohana’s proceedings marked the first time the law was applied to a theft with no apparent motive besides the thrill of vandalism.With their client potentially facing years behind bars, Rohana’s defense lawyers, federal public defenders Catherine C. Henry and Nancy MacEoin, balked at what they saw as prosecutorial overreach.This was case, they thought, that they could fight and win. They dove into research on the statue’s history and consulted with art world insiders, all the while counseling Rohana to hold his nerve and reject any pressure to plead guilty.“Being a drunk kid doing an act of vandalism was never meant to fit into the federal art theft statute,” Henry would later argue in court. “That just doesn’t belong here.”As the trial opened this month, they highlighted another key element of the federal art crimes statute -- a requirement that the stolen item be worth more than $5,000 -- and asked jurors to consider a question:Just how do you measure the value of a Chinese relic considered by all accounts to be priceless?Pegging the price of a fingerThe Chinese government has forbidden the sale or purchase of the terra-cotta warriors from the Emperor Qin Shi Huang’s tomb. And yet, a wide range of estimated values has been put forth over the years.The United Nations valued them at $350,000 each when they were first displayed in 1985. Lloyd’s of London insured The Cavalryman at $4.5 million before it was shipped for exhibit to The Franklin Institute in 2017.But those sums were for the whole statue. Rohana’s case concerned only the value of the thumb he stole.“The only way I could appraise this is accept the $4.5 million insured value and then try to assess what percentage the thumb would represent,” said Michael Cohn, an Asian-art appraiser called as an expert witness for the government.Cohn ultimately concluded a hand would comprise roughly 20 percent and the thumb alone just 5 percent of the statue’s overall value. His appraisal: $150,000.He justified that determination with a sweeping analysis that touched on everything from the importance of opposable thumbs in human evolution to the role fingers have played throughout art history, starting with the first ancient cave paintings and running through to Michelangelo’s masterwork The Creation of Adam on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.Defense lawyers dismissed Cohn’s reasoning as “preposterous, circular logic.”“You placed a value of 20 percent on a hand and 5 percent on a finger?” MacEoin challenged him in cross-examination. “So, if a statue was missing five fingers, it would lose more value than if it was missing the whole hand?”Asian-art specialists called by the defense were equally dubious -- though, they too, confidently produced wildly differing figures.“The thumb in question, I would characterize as a pottery shard,” said Marley Rabstenek, who owns appraisal and art brokerage firms in New York and Hong Kong. “Taken out of context -- away from the warrior, away from the army -- it loses all of its marketability. It just becomes a piece of pottery that really has no value.”Its value at an auction? Maybe $500 -- at most, she saidJurors even got a dose of celebrity on the stand. Lark E. Mason, a bespectacled, bow-tied staple of PBS’ Antiques Roadshow, suggested the value of The Cavalryman might actually increase once the broken thumb was restored.Modern adhesives are more sophisticated and less noticeable than those used when the statue was first reassembled from more than 30 pieces in the 1970s and ‘80s, he said. Still, Mason estimated the thumb’s price at $1,000, likening any value it might have on its own to the sentimental worth a collector might assign to a vial of dirt from Yankee Stadium or one brick from the Great Wall of China.“When you’re talking about digit-sized elements, you’re not talking about artistry at all,” he testified. “You’re talking about someone who wants a piece of the greater whole.”Challenged during his cross-examination with those vastly varying estimates and approaches, Cohn threw up his hands.“Appraisal practices are not set up in such a way that these things are set in stone,” he said. “Everything becomes a little bit subjective.”DeadlockIn the end, the inherent subjectivity in the various appraisals left jurors exasperated. For 11 hours over two days this week, they clustered in a room off the 16th-floor courtroom, arguing over whether Rohana’s crime -- and more specifically the single clay digit he stole -- fit the criteria of the federal theft statute.Finally they told the judge they were unable to agree.In interviews afterward, six members of the panel described a seven-to-five vote to acquit -- all because they couldn’t conclude beyond a reasonable doubt how much The Cavalryman’s thumb was worth.“We just didn’t know what to make of any of that,” said juror Pedro Padilla, a 62-year-old operations supervisor from Allentown. “You had one person saying it was worth a couple hundred and another saying it was worth hundreds of thousands.”Prosecutors have not yet indicated whether they intend to retry Rohana. If the case does not proceed in federal court, it’s possible that he could face state charges such as criminal mischief or vandalism -- crimes with much less severe penalties.Either way, Assistant U.S. Attorney K.T. Newton said, some form of punishment is warranted.“Michael Rohana deliberately broke the thumb,” she said in her final pitch to jurors last week. “He took it out of the Franklin Institute, and he took it home. That is theft. That is stealing.”But as the judge declared a mistrial Tuesday, Rohana -- who had spent much of the prior week with his brow knitted in anxiety, his face looking like he might vomit at any moment -- cracked a first, wary smile.He had been spared for now, at least, by the unknowable price of a thumb.___ (c)2019 Philly.com Visit Philly.com at www.philly.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: April 12, 2019End of Document

Thanks to Trump, China missed the ending to Game of ThronesStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeMay 22, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: CULTURE; Pg. 1Length: 390 wordsByline: Julia GonzalesBodyHere's where it gets tense: At the time, Tencent stated they were having "transmission medium problems", even instructing viewers that they would notify them of "another broadcasting time". "And I said, "That's okay, we're going to tariff their products". The Chinese government has targeted the entertainment industry in the past when relations with another country deteriorated.Fans in China not being able to stream Game of Thrones is just another example of how increasingly tense the trade disputes between the United States andChina have become over the last few weeks.On Sunday night, 19.3 million viewers watched the final episode of Game of Thrones across HBO's various platforms (includingHBO G0 andHBO Now), which exceeded the previous series high of 18.4 million viewers from last week, HBO said on Monday. The brief statement didn't give a new air date, and the company declined to provide further detail. "What's next - cutting off internet connections betweenChina and the U.S.?" wrote one user on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. "Shame, shame, shame", some users posted a famous line from the show - along with bell emojis - on Weibo.Other people blame the trade war between US andChina.Frustrated Democrats plan 'emergency' impeachment meeting after McGahn subpoena snubFormer White House counsel Don McGahn yesterday defied a subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee , at the White House's request.Tencent, on the other hand, seems to have been unable to convey the episode as one of the consequences of theongoing trade war with the US. We can only imagine the firestorm thatTencent is now experiencing, as getting between a GOT fan and their weekly fix sounds a lot like trying to hold back the Army of the Dead. State media reported that TV stations and streaming platforms inChina abruptly canceled the premiere of "Over the Sea I Come to You", which centers on a Chinese father sending his only child to study in America.Not long after the finale aired, anHBO spokesman told the Wall Street Journal thatChina had restricted the showing due to the ongoing trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.Washington and Beijing have amped up their trade battle recently, with both sides imposing new tariffs on each other and President Donald Trump designating Chinese tech giant Huawei a national-security threat.Load-Date: May 23, 2019End of Document

Google shareholders ask to assess the risks of a possible return to ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 20, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 346 wordsBodyA group of shareholders from Alphabet, Google's parent, asked the company during the shareholding meeting on Wednesday to prepare a report studying the human rights impact of a hypothetical search engine return to China with a version Censored.The petition, which was rejected by the assembly, referred to the company's "Dragonfly Project" to re-operate in China - where it has had no presence since 2010 - with a censored search engine that meets the requirements of the Chinese Communist Party.Following the upheaval after information about this project was leaked last year, Google claimed to have cancelled it, but information recently published by the specialized press claims that the Mountain View company (California, USA) hasn't completely abandoned it."Dragonfly could increase the Chinese government's control over citizens by allowing it to track individuals' searches on Google by linking them to their phone numbers," the motion put forward by the investor group, which failed to support the majority shareholders.In its rejection of the proposal, the firm's management insisted that "there are currently no plans to bring the search engine to China", that no work is being carried out on that project and that the people who were in it have been reassigned to other areas .In addition to the reference to China, Alphabet's minority shareholders submitted 12 other proposals, mostly related to issues of transparency, equality within the company and social responsibility, all of which were rejected.Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page control 51% of the vote, and the latter, who holds alphabet's CEO, did not attend the meeting with investors - where he hasn't shown up since 2016 - leading to public complaints from some of the Present.Another of the most striking motions that was rejected was the one promoted by the SumOfUs group, which proposed to anticipate possible antitrust measures by regulators in the US and Europe and "strategically reduce the company's dimensions through sales of companies," that is, divide Alphabet into several companies.Load-Date: June 22, 2019End of Document

PROMINENT UYGHUR WRITER DIES AFTER BEING DEPRIVED TREATMENT IN XINJIANG INTERNMENT CAMPStates News ServiceJune 17, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 873 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A prominent Uyghur writer has died after being deprived treatment for diabetes while held in an internment camp in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), according to sources.Nurmuhemmet Tohti, 70, was detained from November 2018 to March this year in China's vast network of camps in the XUAR, where up to 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas have been held since April 2017, his Canada-based granddaughter, Zorigul, recently reported.During his internment, Tohti was denied treatment for diabetes and heart disease, and was only released to his family after he became incapacitated due to his medical condition, she wrote in a message posted to the Uyghurnaz Facebook page, which is maintained by members of the Uyghur exile community.After suffering complications, Tohti died on May 31, Zorigul wrote, adding that she had only learned of his death 11 days later, because members of her family in the XUAR feared that they would targeted for detention at an internment camp for making the information public.Zorigul's comments were accompanied by a post to Instagram in which Tohti's grandson, Babur Ilchi, said he had called his grandmother, who confirmed that his grandfather had died."Shortly after the call, my grandma received a message from the Chinese government saying she had answered a foreign call and that that was a dangerous decision," he wrote, adding, "What did she do other than tell us he had passed away? Why should that be met with consequences?""His name was Nurmuhemmet Tohti and he was a respected writer; no affiliation with terrorism, which is what the Chinese government claims these concentration camps are fighting against. He deserved better, and so do the MILLIONS of Uyghurs who are suffering in these camps rights now."Ilchi wrote that by denying him treatment, "my grandfather was murdered by the Chinese government."Tohti, from Tewekul village in the XUAR's Hotan (in Chinese, Hetian) prefecture, had graduated from Xinjiang University in the prefectural capital Urumqi in 1977 and worked as a lecturer at Hotan Pedagogical College before taking a position as a secretary with the Hotan Prefectural Government.Despite faithfully serving the government for many years, authorities have not released any official confirmation of the death of the man who also worked for the Xinjiang Writers Association and was revered within his community for having left an indelible mark on Uyghur literature.While investigating Tohti's case, RFA's Uyghur Service spoke with multiple contacts at various branches of the Hotan Prefectural Government, but no one at these departments was able to confirm his death or where he had been held.However, when asked when Tohti was released from his internment camp, the secretary of the Hotan Prefectural Department of Culture told RFA that it was "about one month ago."Other reports from within the Uyghur community in exile suggested that despite his critical health condition, Tohti was kept in shackles after being released from the camp in March and returned to his family, although RFA was unable to independently confirm this information.Camp networkThough Beijing initially denied the existence of internment camps, China has tried to change the discussion, describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage radicalization and help protect the country from terrorism.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.In May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in an apparent reference to the policies of Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, cited "massive human rights violations in Xinjiang where over a million people are being held in a humanitarian crisis that is the scale of what took place in the 1930s."U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback recently told RFA's Uyghur Service in an interview that countries around the world must speak out on the Uyghur camps, or risk emboldening China and other authoritarian regimes."The Muslim countries should do that. The Western world, the entire world, should do this and condemn these sort of internment camps, of over a million people interned in the year 2019, and they are interned primarily because of their faith and the practice of their faith," he said.The U.S. Congress has also joined in efforts to halt the incarcerations, debating legislation that seeks accountability for China's harsh crackdown on the Uyghurs. The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act would appoint a special State Department coordinator on Xinjiang and require regular reports on the camps, the surveillance network and the security threats posed by the crackdown.Reported by Shohret Hoshur for RFA's Uyghur Service.

Happy Friday, everybody, I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us. And it is Friday, June 7th, jobs Friday, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Trade tensions are continuing this morning, President Trump reportedly planning to declare a new national state of emergency to impose tariffs on Mexico in just three days.Markets are waiting trade and waiting the May jobs report, any news on both, the health of the labor market, in question, after that disappointing ADP report on Wednesday.Our jobs report special this morning, jobs in America kicking off this morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, all hands on deck, join us for that.And then the threat from Huawei, the company signing a major deal with Russia, as one technology giant warns that banning Huawei could be a national security risk.Investors, hungry for Beyond Meat, the stock soared yesterday, after the company's first quarter earnings report as a public company.Plus, Tom Brady's bling, the Patriots' quarterback shows off his six Super Bowl rings and his chugging skills last night. We'll show you the viral video of terrific Tom.MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.BARTIROMO: Let's look at markets this morning on this jobs Friday. We've got a pretty good firmer tone, once again, this morning, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ, up for three days straight on some optimism over trade, hopes of a cut in interest rates and the momentum continues this morning.The Dow Futures are up 68 points right now, the S&P Futures up 7-3/4, and the NASDAQ Futures higher by 26 points. Investors, of course, are waiting the May jobs report that is out in two hours' time. Estimates call for 185,000 jobs to have been added to the economy, in the month of May, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.6 percent.Joining me right now is the CEO of ETF Trends, Tom Lydon. And Tom, it is always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for joining us.TOM LYDON, CEO, ETF TRENDS: Hi, Maria, nice to be here.BARTIROMO: So, tell me about all of this nervousness that we've been seeing in this market this last month or so, about trade, has that resulted in investors pulling money from ETFs? What's the sentiment out there?LYDON: Well, the good thing is, all this trade tension has not rocked the investor's support. We've continued to see more money flowing in the ETFs. However, it's shifted a little bit in the second quarter compared to a lot of money that was going into U.S. equities. We started to see more money going into foreign equities, and especially emerging markets.And then, most recently, with the uncertainty about the Fed, we've seen more money going into higher yielding fixed income bonds because, in fact, we're not as concerned about rising interest rates.Investors are now in a better position to be able to chase after higher yields with the threat of higher rates really moving aside. We're seeing more, actually, billions of dollars going into high yield or lower quality corporate ETFs.BARTIROMO: Yes, but look where interest rates have gone, I mean, they've gone down. You talk about the threat of an interest rate hike on the side, yes, and now people want to see an interest rate cut where we've got trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as the U.S. and Mexico now.That's on top of all of that, the President reportedly now mulling a new national emergency to impose those tariffs on Mexico in just a few days. The President commented on tariffs with FOX News' Laura Ingraham last night. Listen to this, got to get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you're the piggy bank that everybody steals and robs from and they deceive you, and they've -- like, they've been doing for 25 years, tariffs are a beautiful thing. It's a beautiful word, if you know how to use them properly. Republicans should love what I'm doing because I view tariffs in two phases.Number one, it's great to negotiate with because people don't want to be tariffed for coming into the United States, I don't want that, and number two, frankly, if (INAUDIBLE) you make a fortune because all the companies are going to move back into the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Tom, your reaction to this? How do markets view the President's plans here?LYDON: Yes, well, when you look at small companies, where really the basis of GDP growth is on the backs of small companies. The interested numbers that we'll get today will be notable. But the ADP number that we had this week was really telling. Those companies that had under 50 employees actually lost 52,000 jobs.The President did a great job with the tax plan. The small businesses benefited hugely from that and we saw a big boost. Now, we're seeing that small businesses are nervous. They're not hiring as much. And although, I think we all believe that this game of chicken that the President is playing with China and Mexico will probably pay off for us.In the meantime, a lot of small businesses are on hold and were not going to be gearing up any time soon until we see this trade talk settled.BARTIROMO: So, does the backdrop feel strong to you still? Because now, you've got the Federal Reserve officials debating whether or not to cut interest rates. The President weighed in on that, as well. I wonder how you feel in terms of the broad backdrop here. Does it feel like the economy has slowed down for you?LYDON: Well, the numbers aren't there that it's slowed. It's slowed a little bit. But the whole key is, the small businesses, if confidence starts to wane, where it appears that it has, because really, you come out of the recession, Maria --BARTIROMO: Yes.LYDON: Big businesses did fine. Small businesses, it took a long time for them to catch up. That tax cut that we had really gave them the boost that we saw the last couple of years.BARTIROMO: Yes.LYDON: Now, you're seeing small businesses pull back again.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see about that. The President weighed in on whether or not we would see lowered interest rates, actually. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're up $14 trillion in value. Look at what's going on with the stock market. And this is despite a Federal Reserve that frankly should have had lower interest rates and everything else. Now, there's a safety net that's good and yet it's more conservative.But, if we didn't have all these interest rate, you know -- who thought he was going to raise interest rates. But if we didn't have that, we would be at 5.2, and the stock market would be up 10,000 points more.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What about that, Tom? Do you think that the Federal Reserve made mistakes here that should have been -- we should have seen rate cuts? Do you think we'll see a rate cut this year?LYDON: Well, I think they did what they had to do based on the numbers they had at the time.BARTIROMO: Right.LYDON: Now, going forward, obviously, they have some new numbers. We have indication that we'll see at least one rate cut, possibly two, throughout the rest of the year. I think what the President is pointing out is very important. We've had some great growth in the market. But, valuations are no longer expensive. We're actually mid-priced, which is fine. And the key is growth.Earnings growth is definitely slowing and that's really important to keep an eye on. I think the future is, now as we're coming up on this 10-year anniversary of the bull market, the longest bull market that we've seen in the history of the stock market, is it long in the tooth? Is it time for investor to diversify towards high yielding bonds, possibly, and especially, cheaper valuations in stocks overseas.BARTIROMO: Is that what you would recommend, other ETFs that you recommend right now, in this environment?LYDON: Yes, absolutely. There's a Nuveen Aggregate Bond ETF, NUAG, N-U-A- G.BARTIROMO: OK.LYDON: Also, Fallen Angel ETFs, ANGL, and then most importantly, emerging markets, there's EEM and Charles Schwab, fundamentally weighted ETF. It's really more on the value side. These areas, I think, in the coming months are going to do very well.BARTIROMO: Tom, thanks so much, good to talk with you.LYDON: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Tom Lydon, joining us there. Stay with us for our coverage of the May jobs report beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern this morning, all hands on deck as we identify where the jobs are right now.I want to look at mortgage rates now, falling to a nearly two-year low, according to Freddie Mac. Dagen is on that story this morning, Dagen, good morning to you.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Let's hope this helps the economy in myriad ways. So, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage falling to the lowest level in 21 months, 3.82 percent. To see how far it's fallen, just compare it to where the 30-year fixed was, just a year ago, 4 -- more than 4-1/2 percentage points, 4.54 percent one year ago, in June of 2018.What does this do to the housing market? Well, existing home sales have been in a slide, showing declines annual, year-over-year declines for 14 straight months. Homes despite the lower mortgage rates still look expensive in many parts of the country, number one.And number two, you will have people who are able to re-fi their mortgages and get some money back or reduce their monthly payment. About 6 million borrowers or even more could see their rates drop through refinancing. It's the largest number in, at least, three years, and that could mean monthly savings north of $1-1/2 billion.So, you re-fi, you lower your payment, and that puts more money in your pockets. So that's good news for the economy, if people are willing to spend it. Maria.BARTIROMO: It was definitely stimulation there. Dagen, thank you, we will see you in a little bit on that.Meanwhile, we've got layoffs at IBM to report, Cheryl Casone with those details now, in headlines, Cheryl, good morning to you.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria, and good morning. As many as 1,700 workers could be affected. The cuts come as IBM seeks to acquire a software company, Red Hat, for $34 billion. IBM shares are up 16 percent so far, this year.Well, now you have some help in blocking those unwanted robocalls. The Federal Communications Commission has voted to give phone companies the right to block the calls without getting customers' permission first. Some carriers currently offer call blocking, but customers must opt in to use them. This new rule that service providers block calls as a default.Well, shares of Beyond Meat, going beyond. Soaring in the premarket, look at this, up more than 24 percent, the company's first results came out as a public company and they beat expectations, net sales, more than tripling to $40 million, Maria. The CEO of Impossible Foods, Pat Brown, another meat alternative company, told you yesterday that his business is booming.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAT BROWN, CEO, IMPOSSIBLE FOODS: In our own business, we've seen just an absolute surge in demand that actually exceeds our expectations by a substantial amount. So, we went from being at about 5,000 restaurants at the end of year, to more than 9,000 now.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, Brown also told you that his company's sales, in Asia, soared in just one quarter. And I was watching that interview yesterday, Maria, and I was fascinated by how it looks so real, the meat does. It's incredible.BARTIROMO: Yes, and he says -- Dagen said it was soy and potatoes.CASONE: Amazing, amazing.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up, quick break, then in Huawei's global expansion, the Chinese technology company strikes a deal with Russia to build its first 5G network, the fallout, coming up.And then round six for the Patriots, the Super Bowl champs celebrate their latest ring bling. Tom Brady shows off some master chugging skills, as well, back in a minute with that.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Let's look at Huawei, Russia's top mobile operator, MTS, defending its decision this morning, to let Huawei build its 5G network. Now, Huawei has been banned from any involvement with 5G networks in the United States.During my exclusive interview with the Vice President, he talked about the risk of using Huawei Telecom.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The whole issue of Huawei is -- it's an issue of national security. I mean, Huawei is, in effect, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chinese Communist Party. And to have Huawei operating as a 5G network in our country or in our allies' countries, we believe represents a fundamental compromise of our national security and the privacy of millions of citizens.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning, former Home Depot and Chrysler CEO, Bob Nardelli, is here, along with Chief Workforce Analyst at EmployBridge, Joanie Courtney, and Dagen McDowell, as always, great to see everybody this morning.JOANIE COURTNEY, CHIEF WORKFORCE ANALYST, EMPLOYBRIDGE: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: What do you make of this Russia now, partnership with Huawei, you know, not just the Vice President, but also, the Secretary of State has told us about the risks around Huawei, they have communist members on its board, the Chairman of the company, the member of the Communist Party.Secretary of State Pompeo told me that the U.S. will be forced to share less information with Europe, because Europe uses Huawei. Now, what about Russia?BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, HOME DEPOT AND CHRYSLER: Yes. I wouldn't want them in my house. I mean, I think there's a very legitimate reason and concern, you know, that the Vice President brought up, Secretary of State brought up with you, Maria, it was a great interview, and I think it's a legitimate concern.BARTIROMO: Somebody said to me the other day, you know, it is our duty to stop China from dominating the world. I wonder how you feel about this, it's the U.S.' duty. I mean, knowing China's behavior and its human abuses, I mean, they're rounding up Uyghurs, right now, you know, in camps, calling them re-education camps, and they are being guarded by guns.They, obviously, have incredible human rights abuses. And it's a Communist country. So, do we want China to continue getting dominant, dominant, dominant, across the world, and this person said to me, it's our duty, and I thought, you know what? I think you're right.COURTNEY: I think -- I do think it is our duty, and it's the duty to protect the American people and privacy issues. But this has been a challenge, you know, for many years, you know, decades and decades. But it's very concerning when you think about the technology that really could -- you know, just really impact privacy, and information, and data, and access --BARTIROMO: Yes.COURTNEY: -- to so many, you know, personal, you know, financial records.BARTIROMO: It's more than individuals. It's defense information. It's where our troops are, across the world.MCDOWELL: Right. So please, China, spy on Russia. Vladimir Putin, what do you think China's going to do to you? Do you really think that China's your ally? So you can stay behind that iron curtain of telecom equipment and allow -- and then Russia will retaliate, of course.It's the biggest problem that Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State has talked with you about, is our allies using this equipment, because, again, then we lose control of any information from a defense perspective, even an intelligence gathering perspective that we might share with these allies. That's the biggest problem. But between Russia and China, please --BARTIROMO: You're OK with that.MCDOWELL: Well, I think --BARTIROMO: I understand what you're saying, though. Yes, this is a different issue.MCDOWELL: They're both spying on the world and trying to disrupt markets. So, are they really that great of an ally? So, maybe they're trying to poke our President in the eye a little bit, with this deal, but China's going to spy on you. If you let China install telecom equipment in your nation, they will be spying on you, period.NARDELLI: You know, Maria, I think what this administration has done is re-establishing a base back here, in the United States. You know, let's think about how we got into this situation. Huge population, we saw it as a very, you know, exciting market to sell into.Because of our tax structure, you know, when I was competing with Siemens, ABB, I didn't have an outsourcing strategy. I had a global competiveness strategy. So, a lot of times, we had to go there to get the prices and the concessions to compete on a global market.BARTIROMO: Yes.NARDELLI: I think the more we're doing now with some of the policies and relaxing some of these issues, that the administration is allowing a repatriation of these jobs and manufacturing technology, back to our country. It's a great thing.BARTIROMO: That's true. But look what Google said. Google is warning the Trump administration that risks compromising national security, if it pushes ahead with export restrictions on Huawei.This, from the Financial Times, Google concerned that the ban would prevent updates to its android operating system on Huawei's smartphones, which could lead to Huawei developing its own version of that software. Now, Google, we know, has been working with China, although recently, pulled back a bit.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: And now, it's actually telling the U.S. to think twice about this ban. I don't know how to read this. What do you think?MCDOWELL: I-- well, one, you know, you have to assume that the Chinese -- that any company that's controlled indirectly or directly by the Chinese government, would do that anyway, would develop its own operating system for your phone. They're worried about global competitiveness.I don't know where the middle ground is, between restricting Huawei technology, even the smartphones, and we've said this early on in this debate. Huawei phones are not allowed to be sold on military bases anywhere, even in the -- in the United States.So, again, we've seen this coming for a very long time. I don't know where the middle ground is with this.BARTIROMO: If Google is thinking that China is not trying to come up with the competitive product to Google right now, I mean, they're out of their minds. Obviously, that's what China is doing.COURTNEY: Yes, Facebook's concerned too. So, I think -- I mean, thank God, our administration is taking this very seriously.NARDELLI: Right.COURTNEY: And I thought that interview with Vice President was great, too. You can see that this is so important to our safety and privacy.NARDELLI: Google has no choice but to protect their base, their core business, right? So, if they see the protectionism come in like that, they're worried about their installed base on the phone.BARTIROMO: Well, China's already trying to copy that.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: We know that. All right, we'll take a quick break. We want to get into autos with you, Bob --NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Automakers are pushing back against the Trump administration emission regulations, with a plan for improved fuel economy. We'll talk about that. Then, more troubles for Lori Loughlin to tell you about, the looming legal conflict between the actress and the University of Southern California, the admission scandal coming up, right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning, the Denver Post reporting that Jeffco schools superintendent proposes demolishing, rebuilding Columbine High School to escape morbid fascination with the shooting.It is a move set to be driven by the ongoing fascination with the school, the Board of Education and administration considering asking voters for up to $70 million to tear it down and build a new facility nearby. Twelve students and a teacher were killed at the school on April 20th, 1999.The Los Angeles Times writes this morning. Lori Loughlin and husband could face legal conflict with USC over admission scandal. The University of Southern California telling lawyers for the actress and her husband, it anticipates legal disputes over the alleged role in the scandal, but it's unclear if USC is considering suing the couple or if the school expects to be sued.And the Miami Herald this morning, says a twist on a gender reveal, it involves an already born rhino and a toy ball. Is it a boy or a girl? Zoo Miami still doesn't know today. They hope to find out the gender of a rare greater one-horned Indian rhinoceros born in April. It's still a mystery.Today, it's father will be given a giant ball to break, revealing either pink or blue. If that doesn't work on rhino, tug-of-war is the backup plan. Oh, God. That is beautiful.Lori Loughlin, in this admission scandal, she still will not admit to anything, and that's a problem.MCDOWELL: This -- it's not clear what this -- what USC is really trying to message with this contacting the lawyers for Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli.But, again, it shows the backs -- the kind of background legal jockeying that's going on with this entire admission scandal, whether who gets sued and by whom, even -- because, again, criminal charges, potential -- criminal charges, but also civilly, very interesting.BARTIROMO: It's an incredible story, actually, and I think that it has put a stink throughout academia universities, whereas they're trying to look at their own, you know, behavior, and make sure that there is nothing like that going on.NARDELLI: Yes, especially in the athletic department, Maria, I mean, there's always that concern or issue is that that student get in because of their academic capability or their athletic capability --BARTIROMO: Or money.NARDELLI: -- or money, yes.COURTNEY: Right.MCDOWELL: But now, the parents of idiot children who they were embarrassed by, had to go out and pay massive amounts of dollars and basically, commit crimes to get their kids into school, is just appalling. The kid is so stupid, they can't get into Yale or USC, why does it matter?Again, their daughter, who they got into USC, she already had a booming social media business. What is the degree matter?COURTNEY: And she didn't want to go. She didn't even want to go.MCDOWELL: I think they were embarrassed by her, clearly, because they wanted that USC diploma so they could brag about it to their friends, is just so -- the crazy world of Hollyweird and rich people.BARTIROMO: Wow, all right, quick break. When we come back, we're looking at the border battle. The U.S. and Mexico said to be making progress over immigration issues, yet there are fresh tariffs on Mexico set for Monday. Where is this going?And then it is jobs Friday, we are expecting to see 185,000 jobs, created in the month of May, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.6 percent. The number is out in two hours' time. Stay with us for our jobs in America special, right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is job's Friday this morning, June 7th. Your top stories right now. 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Mexico trade talks resumed for day three. Tariffs set to go into effect on Monday as President Trump considers declaring another national emergency. But he also says Congress is to blame.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I say we're going put tariffs on because we want you to help us with. Because they won't pass any legislation in Congress. What they are doing is they're hurting a deal.

They ruin a million families every year. If you look at that, that's really an invasion.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: New border surveillance video shows dozens of migrants casually walking around in unfinished border fence. Joining me right now to talk more about that is the executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations at ICE, Nathalie Asher.Nathalie, it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.NATHALIE ASHER, EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR ENFORCEMENT AND REMOVAL OPERATIONS AT ICE: Good morning, thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Can you characterize what's happening at the border and where specifically?ASHER: Certainly. Well, it is an absolute crisis. It is a humanitarian and border crisis, which also spills into a national security and public safety crisis as it relates coming into the interior. You're asking where it's affecting us, it's all across the southwest border.The numbers are continuing to go north, our partners in CBP are holding in the upwards of 19,000 people in their custody who are awaiting processing of which over 8,000 are single adults awaiting placement into detention facilities. We and enforcement and removal operations are at an absolute - - we've hit a breaking point, we have close to 53,000 individuals in our custody. This is a true crisis, and it appears that it's not going to stop anytime soon.BARTIROMO: You know, Nathalie, what really struck me when I took the show to the border a couple of weeks ago -- a month ago, or so, was that the situation with children.ASHER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Where people are renting out their kids, and so, that smugglers could come across the border with children, and then, you know, look like they are a "family", and then the kids go back home and then they do it all again. Mothers getting a $140 apparently for children.Can you -- can you tell us what's happening in these countries, Guatemala, El Salvador, where we are seeing this renting situation. Can you confirm that?ASHER: Well, it's absolutely a confirmation. Our partners in ICE, homeland security investigations have been doing remarkable work. They've sent hundreds of agents to the border also working with our international connections, our attaches in those home countries to combat these fraudulent operations that are ongoing.It's these -- not -- it's these criminal organizations who are enticing sadly families or people to pose as families all in the name of making a profit to bring to this country. And there's undoubtedly a fraud and many children who are clearly being recycled and being used over and over again to come to our border with an adult because the vulnerability that we have in our system is we are unable to detain these families who are coming across specifically male heads of household.So, we have seen a sharp increase in that type of family composition, if you will. And there's no question we know to date, at least, 25 percent of those types of family units that are making presents are fraudulent.BARTIROMO: Wow.ASHER: So, again, it's such an alarming situation. It's a crisis, it's a danger to children. And without changes to the laws, without something more has to be done, it's going to continue to get worse.BARTIROMO: And one of the issues is as these kids are showing up at the border and they've been hitchhiking, they've been walking for three months, and they're sick.So, the ICE members, the Border Patrol men, and women are actually finding themselves changing diapers, transporting kids to hospitals, doing all sorts of stuff, but not their jobs in terms of staying at the border?ASHER: Right. And you've heard from our CBP partners, just -- you know, about 40 percent of their agents are having to be pulled off the line to do those types of things. The same thing is going on in ICE. My folks, in enforcement and removal operations, I have hundreds of deportation officers who I've had to divert to the border to assist.And not necessarily enforcement, but releasing of family units. You see the stat since December 21st. My component has released. We will be over 200,000 releases of family units into the interior certainly by next week.I think, yesterday we are at 197,000.BARTIROMO: Wow.ASHER: And all of this is at the expense of interior enforcement. If I'm having to divert officers to do releases --BARTIROMO: Right.ASHER: I have more individuals in custody. We are also affected, we're not able to do our job to the interior.BARTIROMO: Right.ASHER: Our criminal arrests are down by almost 15 percent. There, without the consequences of arrest, the incentive is going to continue for these individuals to come to the United States.BARTIROMO: So, is that part of the reason for what's happening at these detention centers? Because the Department of Homeland Security has found, "egregious" conditions at ICE detention facilities last year.A new report shows that department watchdogs found unusable bathrooms, expired food during four unannounced visits. What's going on there, Nathalie?ASHER: So, I think as it relates to ICE detention centers, these inspections, and audits while necessary, oftentimes these are on-the-spot corrections of situations that I think are often exaggerated if you will.Listen, it's quite remarkable when we are in taking close to 400,000 individuals into our custody. And now at any given time, we're over 50,000 in custody where we're essentially running little cities of individuals from over 170 countries.The operation is colossal. The men and women of ICE, of ERO specifically, do a phenomenal job. A humane care, medical care, et cetera, for these individuals who are awaiting their removal proceedings.BARTIROMO: So, what could you do, do you think at ICE to make these detention centers cleaner and better?ASHER: I think, it's a constant sort of policing of ourselves. We have a tiered approach to conducting inspections of our facilities. I think that that's just a constant that, you know, on the occasion will there be something that needs to be corrected absolutely.But overall, I believe that the conditions that we have for aliens who come into our custody are of the most excellent condition.BARTIROMO: All right, well, we'll see if Congress can do anything about those loopholes, Nathalie. We understand the issues. Good to have you on the program this morning. Thank you.ASHER: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Nathalie Asher from ICE there.Meanwhile, Facebook is said to be gearing up for a possible antitrust investigation. Cheryl Casone with the details there. And we know that the antitrust departments already targeted Google.CASONE: Yes, and here we go with Facebook. And they're getting ready, definitely. Facebook, as the social media giant has revamped its defense team as it facing a more serious antitrust threat, the most at its history.The Wall Street Journal says the Facebook has appointed new heads to its legal and communications teams with an emphasis on experience in dealing with the government.Facebook declining to report on the reports of this. Federal Trade Commission said to be overseeing this investigation. Many tech companies under the watchful eye of the government. Now, as you can see, Facebook is about a quarter percent higher in the premarket.YouTube's steps this week to blocks hate speech video, some spark to backlash online. An analysis by social media intelligence firm, Storyful, shows that messages with threatening terms directed at YouTube started appearing on social media, about 150 times an hour, yesterday. That's five times more than normal. And one Twitter poster user said, "Be careful who you silence, YouTube.Meanwhile, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos confronted by a protester at the Mars conference in Las Vegas. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRIYA SAWHNEY, ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST, BERKELY, CALIFORNIA: Jeff, please. You're the richest man on the planet. You can help the animals. You can help the environment.JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER, AMAZON: Do you have a response to that?CASONE: She was protesting -- it's hard to hear, but she was protesting animal-rights, a chicken farm that she is angry about that supplies Amazon. She reportedly is from the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere.Again, they supply Amazon with chicken, but that Jeff Bezos, kind of-- kind of laugh it off, to be honest with you.And this may be hard to watch, folks. At the same Amazon conference in Las Vegas, Boston Dynamics robot dog, Spot, collapsed on stage. It's kind of sad, Maria. You know how I feel about these robots. You can see Spot malfunctioning during the presentation.Meanwhile, the company is reportedly planning to sell the robot dogs. Boston Dynamics says that Spot should be available for purchase within months. Not clear how much it's going to cost.I always hate seeing them when they kick the robot and knock it down. I know it's a robot, but, you know, I just can't help myself.BARTIROMO: Well, don't feel bad for robots, they're going to have a lot of job opportunities in the future.CASONE: It's ridiculous. I know.BARTIROMO: Yes, thank you, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up, automakers are pushing back against Trump administration emission regulations with a plan for a better fuel economy. Who better to ask than Bob Nardelli, who knows all about these subjects, he's on the panel this morning.And then, round six for the Patriots. The Super Bowl champs celebrate their latest ring bling. Plus, Tom Brady's chugging skills go viral. All of that coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Automakers sending a warning to President Trump that his new emission rules could impact sales and create industry instability. Joining us right now, the Car Coach, Lauren Fix. Lauren, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.LAUREN FIX, CAR COACH: Good to see you. Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: What's your take on these emissions and these new proposals. What the automakers are pushing back on?FIX: Well, the bottom line for, at least, the auto industry is they plan years in years in advance. So, they're kind of working in the, you know, 2025 and what they're going to produce based on what they thought the emissions rules and campaign standards were going to be the corporate average fuel economy. However, California and, of course, Sacramento and the California Research Board have been pushing for higher standards even though manufacturers are not meeting those standards, and that's why the president stepped in with this administration to say wait a minute, this is not working, California doesn't want to negotiate; they're completely inflexible.They want one state to control the other 49 states are doing. So, the federal government say, we're going to step in and change all the rules. This is where things turn around where 17 manufacturers are saying: well, can we come with a happy medium? Maybe a five percent decrease in what California is suggesting. This is what they wrote yesterday in a letter that would freeze the EPA standards from 2020-2026. The big factor on this is, is that the free markets should rain. Why is one state controlling what the other 49 are doing, why is it that someone in West Virginia has to pay the higher rates in order to meet the California standards and that's why the federal government has stepped in, and that's where we are today and new rules are coming out soon -- and I don't think they're going to be very flexible.BARTIROMO: And that's exactly what Bob Nardelli said during the commercial break, because President Obama wanted California to write the rules.NARDELLI: Yes. You know, we lived through this in '07, '08, and '09. And the administration adopted California standards rather than standing tall with the EPA, Maria, and establishing their own standards. We, honest to god, thought about doing make a car for California and then make a car for the rest of the U.S., because there was a major difference in the emission standards and the cost to achieve those. We knew at the time there would be an off-ramp that the industry, as hard as they were with using the most available technology, we're not going to meet them. And as we just heard, they're not meeting him. Tremendous progress, but not getting to those standards. So, I think this rollback that the administration is talking about, I would be in favor of it, and establish reasonable aggressive standards but don't let California dictate -- you know, let's not let the tail wag the dog.MCDOWELL: For the nation.NARDELLI: For the nation, yes.MCDOWELL: You'll want to get into a situation where all of these states are competing with each other for fuel economy standards. One car for the U.S., one SUV for the U.S. One thing I will add, this is what politicians do, though, is that President Obama raising the fuel economy standards going through 2026, they hide the cost to consumers. The burden of increase costs was on the company and then the company would ultimately pass it on to the consumer rather than just hike it. If you want to work on climate change and have a green initiative, raise fuel prices it would do the same thing but they're sneaking and they hide it and that's exactly what --NARDELLI: You know, if you want to be totally compliant, and I had this discussion, so then we would be limited. In other words, the government would tell you, you can only make so many trucks, so many SUVs, and you're going to have to make all of these 500s which nobody bought. I tried to make the point the consumer decides what car they want to buy and what fuel prices, Dagen, as you say they are. People are going for SUVs are going for trucks so why would the government tell the consumer you're only going to be able to buy this sized car to meet the fuel efficiency.MCDOWELL: But see, they don't do it directly. They do it indirectly. They put the burden on the company and then people are like why are you making all these little two-door cars? I want the -- why is the SUV more expensive? It's because the government regulations.BARTIROMO: Jump in here, Lauren, because -- I mean, the automaker are -- if you've got two different standards, they're going to be forced to make two different cars.FIX: Right, and got to remember, the government has -- is not great at running business. We already know that. We've seen it based on the (INAUDIBLE) service and Amtrak, they don't have a clue and they want more power over the auto industry. They're demanding electric vehicles. Well, over the past few years there has not been a change of over two percent of electric vehicles. Manufacturers are building them because California is forcing you them to build them. Because if you don't, you cancel vehicles in their state. So, now, we're building cars that aren't selling, that are not profitable. Businesses are in business to make profits not just for the stock market, but for, you know, they got to be able to grow. You can't grow if you're not making profits. So, they're building tons of electric vehicles people don't want.BARTIROMO: You would think that this is understood given the fact that, you know, the industry has tried to push out electric cars for a lot of years. The consumers is not necessarily biting a big way.NARDELLI: Proof positive -- let's look at Tesla. They've been at it for a while, they lost the first advantage and they're having trouble building cars.MCDOWELL: Yes, their cars are super cool, though -- man, they're rolling.(CROSSTALK)FIX: Tesla is in a lot of trouble but if you exclude them the rest of the manufacturers, they're not making profits. They're building products, really cool products: Audi E-trons and Jaguar, and BMW or whatever. The fact is, is they're not making profits. They're selling them because they have to. There's no other choice.BARTIROMO: There you go. Lauren, thank you. Thanks for weighing in. Lauren Fix joining us there.FIX: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We got a patriot party to tell you about.

Happy Friday, Maria. They were throwing bottles and debris on the ice in Boston last. The fans were disgusted. St. Louis Blues scored a goal that many say should not have been allowed. The Blues took a 2-0 lead of the third period when David Paran scored a goal; many thought there would be a delayed penalty because the player got tripped but there is no tripping -- a non-call, just like we saw in the NFC championship -- and the Blues go on and win the game, 2-1. They are one win away from the Stanley Cup.NBA finals game number four tonight in Oakland. One person we won't see courtside is Warriors Minority Owner, Mark Stevens -- so-called fan who shoved the Raptor's Kyle Lowery in Toronto's game three win. The NBA has banned Stevens one year from the team and fines him half-a-million-dollars.

Alibaba Files For Potential $20 Billion Hong Kong Listing - ReportsTheStreet.comJune 13, 2019 Thursday 7:58 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 472 wordsByline: Martin BaccardaxHighlight: Alibaba shares edged higher Thursday following multiple media reports that the online retailing giant has filed for a Hong Kong listing that could be worth as much as $20 billion.BodyAlibaba Group Holding Co.'s  shares edged higher Thursday following multiple media reports that the online retailing giant has filed for a Hong Kong listing that could be worth as much as $20 billion.Reuters reported the listing could come as early as the third quarter of this year, while Bloomberg added that China International Capital and Credit Suisse will steer the secondary offering, the biggest follow-on share sale in at least seven years. Alibaba floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, raising $25 billion in what remains the world's biggest IPO some five years later.Alibaba shares were marked 0.6% higher in pre-market trading Thursday, indicating an opening bell price of $160.04 each, a move that would extend the stock's year-to-date gain to around 16.75%.Alibaba's move to list in Hong Kong could reflect concern for the fate of Chinese companies doing business with, or having capital ties to, the United States as it presses hard for changes to its current trade agreement with Beijing.China-based firms have flocked to the U.S. market to raise equity capital since Alibaba's blockbuster IPO in 2014, with 33 listings worth $9 billion last year and 2019 pace that could see over 40 companies debuting before the end of the year.Luckin Coffee Inc.  debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange with an IPO that valued the China-based rival to Starbucks  at more than $4.2 billion, but chipmaker SMIC said it would de-list its U.S shares and place them on the Hong Kong market instead.Last month, former White House adviser Steve Bannon, a noted hawk on U.S.-China relations but nonetheless an influential voice in certain Republican party circles, told the South China Morning Post that "the next move we make is to cut off all the IPOs, unwind all the pension funds and insurance companies in the U.S. that provide capital to the Chinese Communist Party.""We'll see a big move on Wall Street to restrict access to capital markets to Chinese companies until they agree to] this fundamental reform," he said.Around 160 Chinese companies are listed on U.S. exchanges, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission -- including Alibaba, Baidu  and JD.Com  -- with around 11 of those having at least a 30% stake owned by the Chinese government.Recent moves by the White House to restrict the ability of China-backed Huawei Technologies from doing business with the Untied States, while simultaneously pressuring its international allies to shut it out of 5G network construction contracts going forward, has created significant tension between Washington and Beijing.It's also raised the prospect of both reprisals from the Chinese government and a "tech cold war" that could add further uncertainty to companies attempting to lever production and exports between the world's two biggest economies.Load-Date: June 14, 2019End of Document

MISSING UYGHUR PROFESSOR PRESUMED DETAINED IN XINJIANG POLITICAL 'RE-EDUCATION CAMP'States News ServiceMay 9, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 937 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A Uyghur professor and founder of a Uyghur language software firm has been missing for more than a year and is presumed detained in a political "re-education camp" in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), according to sources.A group of Uyghur intellectuals living in exile recently posted to social media a list of colleagues they believe are interned in the XUAR's vast network of camps, where up to 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas have been held since April 2017.Among those on the list is Alim Ahet, a faculty member at the School of Mathematics and System Science at Xinjiang University in the XUAR capital Urumqi, who the exiled intellectuals noted had "disappeared" from their WeChat group in January 2018.Since then, they said, Ahet's overseas contacts have been unable to communicate with him and believe he has been arrested.Ahet had partnered with Microsoft while working as a lecturer at Xinjiang University and in 1998 formed Urumqi UighurSoft Computer Ltd.the first company to produce software in the Uyghur, Kazakh and Kirgiz languages.UighurSoft also produced dictionary software used by speakers of Uyghur, Kazakh and Kirgiz to study Chinese, as well as the first software to include a spell checking function for the three languages.Ahet's firm gained him recognition as a ground breaking software developer and in 2011, Chinese officials recognized him with an award as a "top ten innovator of China."While investigating Ahet's disappearance, RFA's Uyghur Service found that his name had been scrubbed from the faculty list on the Xinjiang University School of Mathematics and System Science website.RFA spoke to a Chinese staff member at the school who confirmed that Ahet "is no longer working here."When asked when he had left the school, the staff member hung up the phone.RFA was also able to contact a source in Urumqi who revealed under the condition of anonymity that Ahet had "not been seen in public for the last year."Alim Ahet's former schoolmate, Norway-based Uyghur activist Helchem Memtiminwho last saw the mathematician in the XUAR in 2003 after he returned from a trip to Londontold RFA he had disappeared sometime "in the summer of 2018."Memtimin called Ahet "one of the most intelligent and quick-thinking students in class," and questioned why he would be targeted by authorities."The Chinese government has incarcerated millions of people in re-education camps, including a vast number of highly educated, extraordinary individuals," said Memtimin, a member of the Norway Uyghur Association."Alim Ahet is a highly trained intellectual; he doesn't need any education from the Chinese government," he said, adding that if Ahet is being held at a camp, authorities should release him "immediately and unconditionally."Camp networkThough Beijing initially denied the existence of re-education camps, Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the XUAR, told China's official Xinhua news agency in October 2018 that the facilities are an effective tool to protect the country from terrorism and provide vocational training for Uyghurs. Official propaganda for a time called them "boarding schools."China recently organized two visits to monitor re-education camps in the XUARone for a small group of foreign journalists, and another for diplomats from non-Western countries, including Russia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Thailandduring which officials dismissed claims about mistreatment and poor conditions in the facilities as "slanderous lies."Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Adrian Zenz, a lecturer in social research methods at the Germany-based European School of Culture and Theology, has said that some 1.5 million people are or have been detained in the campsequivalent to just under 1 in 6 members of the adult Muslim population of the XUARafter initially putting the number at 1.1 million.Michael Kozak, the head of the State Department's human rights and democracy bureau, in an apparent reference to the policies of Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, said in March people "haven't seen things like this since the 1930s" and called the internment of more than a million Uyghurs "one of the most serious human rights violations in the world today."In November 2018, Scott Busby, the deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor at the U.S. Department of State, said there are "at least 800,000 and possibly up to a couple of million" Uyghurs and others detained at re-education camps in the XUAR without charges, citing U.S. intelligence assessments.In remarks at a news conference at the Pentagon on May 3 that rankled Beijing, Randall Schriver, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, said "the Communist Party is using the security forces for mass imprisonment of Chinese Muslims in concentration camps."Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news conference on May 6 that China "voiced strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition" to Schriver's comments, which he called "totally inconsistent with the facts."Reported by Sada for RFA's Uyghur Service.

Society for Threatened Peoples: 30 Years After the Tiananmen Square MassacreTargeted News ServiceJune 4, 2019 Tuesday 1:18 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 369 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: GOTTINGEN, Germany BodyThe Society for Threatened Peoples issued the following news release:* * *- Commemorate the victims, call out the perpetrators* * *The Society for Threatened Peoples (STP) organized a vigil for the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, which took place 30 years ago. Human rights activists gathered in front of the Chinese Embassy in Berlin, together with representatives of the Independent Chinese PEN Center and the Federation for a Democratic China.On June 4, 1989, hundreds (or perhaps thousands) of people got killed in the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations, and thousands of government critics were arrested throughout the country. "The Chinese government never apologized to the relatives of those who got killed, and the actual number of victims was kept secret," stated Hanno Schedler, the STP's Expert on Genocide Prevention and Responsibility to Protect. "On the contrary, a Chinese government official recently described the massacre as justified." It is noteworthy that the government in Beijing commented on the excessive violence at all - as the massacre is usually tabooed, and all commemorations are suppressed.All media are under state control, and the internet and social media channels are censored. Many young people in China are not informed about the crime. "The only possible option to heal the wounds would to be to initiate a process of coming-to-terms with the past. The Communist Party should listen to the families of the victims, instead of silencing them," Schedler emphasized.In China, state oppression is not a relic of the past. In the Chinese media, the massive human rights violations in Xinjiang or Tibet are censored, and large parts of the population are unaware of the fact that more than 1.5 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz people are kept detained in reeducation camps.On Monday (June 3, 2019), the STP broadcast a live interview (via Facebook) with Tienchi Martin-Liao, representative of the Independent Chinese PEN Center. The conversation focused on the massacre, its political and social consequences, and on the current situation in China.

Technological innovations, global partnerships key to eliminating poverty, hungerPR NewswireMay 17, 2019 Friday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2386 wordsDateline: BEIJING, May 17, 2019 BodyPR NewswireA video story presented by China.org.cn on Global Solicitation and Challenge Prize on Best Poverty Reduction Practices: The 3rd annual International Seminar on Global Poverty Reduction Partnerships organized by three Rome-based UN agencies (RBAs) -- The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the World Food Programme (WFP) -- together with the International Poverty Reduction Center in China (IPRCC) and China Internet Information Center (CIIC), was held Wednesday in the margins of the Expo for International Cooperation (EXCO 2019) in Rome, Italy. It focused on the role of technological innovations and global partnerships in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), accelerating poverty reduction and eradicating hunger.This year's seminar discussed how to better use technological innovations in rural areas to promote inclusive and sustainable development, promote food security, nutrition, sustainable agriculture, gender equality and reduce rural poverty. Partnerships, with a special focus in South-South and Triangular Cooperation, were highlighted as key to promoting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The Deputy Executive Director of WFP, Amir Abdulla, speaking on behalf of the RBAs, highlighted the role of partnerships to achieving the SDGs in several domains around the world, and how the use of technology improves the lives of the most disadvantaged communities in rural areas."I'm glad that this year's seminar is focusing on technological innovations to help accelerate poverty reduction and achieve zero hunger. We need to continue working in a collaborative way to bridge the increasing gap of technology gains between developed/developing countries, rural/urban areas and disadvantaged communities," Abdulla said.He also noted that one initiative that is increasingly generating synergies between public and private actors is e-commerce to connect farmers with value chains and markets at a global scale. This has proven to reduce rural poverty, by increasing farmer's incomes and productivity and creating jobs.Xia Gengsheng, vice minister of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Reduction and Development, said that in the past six years, China has made decisive victories in the battle against poverty. Based on current standards, China has lifted 82.39 million rural poor out of poverty, with the rural poor population down from 98.99 million in 2012 to 16.6 million in 2018. The poverty rate has decreased from 10.2% to 1.7%.He emphasized in light of the international experience and China's practices in poverty reduction, the last miles of poverty reduction efforts are the hardest. "We need to continue to push forward with all efforts, fight against poverty with perseverance, consolidate current achievements and reduce poverty for more people. We will never give up during the battle," he said.Xia noted that the Chinese government is working on the post-2020 strategy for poverty reduction. "We will take into account China's current context and learn from international successful experiences. We will promote cooperation with international agencies such as the FAO, IFAD and WFP, so that we can better explore measures to address relative poverty and promote China's poverty alleviation cause in a sustainable manner."Tang Shengyao, director of the Office of South-South and Triangular Cooperation of FAO speaking on behalf of the RBAs, highlighted during his remarks the importance of this seminar for disseminating successful experiences on the use of technological innovations for rural development. He indicated that sharing these innovations is useful for all development actors. He also added that the seminar serves as a platform for raising awareness on the key role that global partnerships play in sustainable development, which is at the core of South-South and Triangular Cooperation, and pointed out that the engagement of new actors such as developing banks and private sector is key for sharing knowledge about technological innovations that contribute to meet the 2030 Agenda.During the seminar, the result of the Global Solicitation and Challenge Prize on Best Poverty Reduction Practices was presented, with the list of the first compilation of 24 poverty reduction case studies released, out of all the 110 best case studies on the shortlist, announced by Xue Lisheng, vice editor-in-chief of CIIC.Xue said, the campaign was jointly launched by seven organizations, including theWorld Bank, theAsian Development Bank, FAO, IFAD, WFP, IPRCC and CIIC, in May 2018 in Beijing. Among 820 case studies received in total, 645 Chinese ones were received, introducing various poverty reduction approaches, such as through tourism, financial poverty alleviation, poverty reduction for vulnerable groups and poverty reduction through employment and entrepreneurship.International organizations and research institutions contributed 175 international case studies from over 30 countries, including Brazil, the Philippines, Colombia, Pakistan, Haiti, Ghana, Cambodia, Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, Laos, Malaysia, etc.Some participants introduced their poverty reduction practices on the seminar. Ni Limin, the director of Alibaba Poverty Relief Fund said, the company fights against poverty in the aspects of education, health, women, ecology, and e-commerce, to help poverty-stricken regions eradicate poverty and to explore a sustainable and participatory "Internet + poverty relief" model."We will leverage more social resources so that more enterprises, institutions, and the public can join the fight against poverty," Ni added.He Zhiwei, county mayor of Horqin Zuoyi Rear Banner (County), Inner Mongolia of China, stressed that scientific and targeted measures should be adopted to reduce poverty in areas with frail ecological environment and severe land desertification. "It is important to improve the living environment and production conditions, foster leading ecological industries and increase income of people in poverty in a sustainable way," he said.Yao Li, the founder and chairperson of BN Vocational School said that efficient charitable vocational education can provide high-quality educational resources for poor and vulnerable young people, thereby improving their ability to get a job and increase income.Ashwani K. Muthoo, director of Global Engagement and Multilateral Relations Division of IFAD, said, "This is a very commendable initiative, because it does give an opportunity for China and the global community to learn from the practices and experiences of people who are actually implementing activities on the grounds. We can identify best practices that can be replicated and scaled in other contexts. We can also explore, further deepen and understand what those innovations are and to see how they can be adopted in other countries and other context."Melanie Ullrich, external relations officer, European Representative Office of ADB said, "With unremitting efforts, the PRC has made remarkable achievement in the past 40 years. China's successful experience in reducing poverty has also generated a bulk of knowledge to share with the rest of the developing world. It could be the immediate, tangible contribution that China can make to the global commitment to end poverty and achieve sustainable development by 2030. The Global Solicitation and Challenge Prize on Best Poverty Reduction Practices is very fruitful and allows more countries to learn from China's experience."As the third seminar of its kind since 2017, this year's seminar has received support from various parties, with a growing number of partners along the way. More than 200 people from governments, international organizations, private sector, civil society and academia attended the seminar.List of the first compilation of best poverty reduction case studies (In no particular order)Title of the case studySubmission organizationBringing laborers out of poverty with vocational education -- A case study on poverty reduction by using a "pedicure" training program in Ziyang CountyHuman Resources and Social Security Bureau of Ziyang County, Shaanxi Province, ChinaPoverty reduction through ecological protection and ecological compensation -- A case study of ecological poverty alleviation in Horqin Zuoyi Rear Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous RegionOffice of the CPC Committee of Horqin Zuoyi Rear Banner, China and Inner Mongolia Minzu UniversityBreaking the cycle of generational poverty through charitable vocational education-A case study of poverty alleviation through the BN Vocational School ModelChina Institute for Poverty Reduction, Beijing Normal UniversityThe path of "Internet + Poverty Alleviation" based on China's national conditions -

(Photo: The White House) The May 7 indictment of a Chinese national and unnamed conspirator for hacking and stealing data from nearly 80 million customers of the health care company Anthem in 2015, which researchers previously linked to Chinese state-sponsored actors, is the latest iteration of a four-year U.S. government trend of publicly charging state-backed hackers. The use of criminal charges as an instrument of foreign policy is striking in its recent prominence and in the complex equities it implicates for policymakers.Two camps have emerged in the debate on the deterrent power of charging foreign hackers. Some argue that charging hackers lacks serious impact. For example, Jack Goldsmith and Robert Williams have argued in Lawfare that the strategy of charging Chinese hackers for theft of U.S. trade secrets has failed to deter such activity, citing the public charges against Chinese state-affiliated hackers in 2017 and 2018 as reason to believe Chinese cyber theft of American intellectual property had not ceased. Others consider such charges an effective tool for deterring malicious cyber activity. John Carlin, who oversaw the early charging of foreign hackers as assistant attorney general for national security from 2014 to 2016, has written about charging foreign hackers more broadly as part of a package of tools that the U.S. government can use to disrupt and deter state-sponsored hacking.We believe the value of bringing criminal charges against foreign hackers is more complicated than the arguments about their deterrent value have so far suggested. In our view, these actions are not without impact. In some cases, charges have led to the arrest of those accused and may deter individual hackers from working with particular states. At the same time, because arrests have been the exception and the charging documents are primarily  speaking indictments  that communicate important details about hacking operations to the public, we conclude that charging foreign hackers, as well as online influence operators, serves purposes other than merely arresting specific individuals. We therefore distinguish between criminal charges as a tool for long-term deterrence versus as a tool for operational disruption.We identify the following objectives to which charging foreign hackers can contribute: (a) attributing malicious cyber activity, (b) disrupting hacker networks, (c) coordinating with further U.S. government actions, (d) providing restitution for the victims and credit to defenders, (e) pressuring states to refrain from future malicious activity and (f) supporting the emergence of robust norms. These dimensions show that the decision to charge foreign hackers goes beyond considerations of deterrence and that prosecutors and policymakers should make those decisions carefully. It takes intensive effort by investigators and prosecutors to compile criminal cases in some cases, years of work so the effect of the act of unsealing them should be maximized and tailored to the strategic goals an indictment is most likely to advance.Since 2013, the Department of Justice has brought 24 cases and 195 counts against 93 foreign nationals for state-linked hacking activity and foreign online influence operations. (Monica Witt, a U.S. national charged in a hacking conspiracy on behalf of the government of Iran, is not included in this tally.) Under the Trump administration, the pace has quickened 16 of the 24 cases were charged after January 2017. A full listis provided below and includes charges against foreign state-linked hackers involved in influence operations, which is often considered together with hacking in discussions of deterrence and responding to malicious cyber activity. This post proposes a framework for evaluating the record of publicly disclosed charges to date and considers the implications for U.S. cyber policy.The framework we describe below illustrates that criminal charges against foreign hackers can serve important objectives, including attribution, disrupting state-proxy relationships, providing punishment and retribution, the so-called  naming and shaming  of adversaries, contributing to joint international actions and building international norms. We outline a few policy considerations involved in charging criminal foreign hacking and discuss some trends and outstanding questions observed from the 24 public cases.A Conceptual Framework forCharging Foreign HackingBringing criminal charges against foreign hackers differs in important ways from other options available to policymakers like press conferences, sanctions or offensive cyber operations for responding to a cyber incident.• First, criminal charging documents are individual-centric that is, they name specific individuals as responsible for the criminal charges they allege. Other ways that states attribute cyber attacks, such as public statements or technical alerts, have typically named an entire nation-state or a specific government agency (although they could name an individual). For instance, the joint attribution by the U.S., U.K., Australia, Denmark and eight other governments of the 2017 NotPetya ransomware attack named the Russian military intelligence unit, the GRU, responsible. In contrast, all indictments to date have named individual defendants for instance, in October 2018, the Justice Department charged seven GRU officers as the perpetrators of a hacking scheme against the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World Anti-Doping Agency.• Second, bringing criminal charges requires evidence that meets a finding of probable cause by a grand jury or a federal judge to bring charges. This is in contrast to intelligence assessments that rely on information gathered from classified sources and methods, which may not be admissible in court. Unsealed indictments or criminal complaints often present evidence to the public, lending them greater credibility, especially to potentially skeptical observers in the technical community.• Third, criminal charging documents are a predicate for law enforcement action. The Justice Department needs an indictment or a criminal complaint to make an arrest in most cases. Unlike a public attribution or diplomatic demarche, a formal criminal charge has the distinct aim of bringing its target to face justice, even though arrests may be unlikely.It is clear that every set of charges serves a different purpose, and potentially more than one. Six  objectives stand out:First, public criminal charges are a way of publicizing attribution of threat actors and foreign governments. Attribution by indictment or criminal complaint is often effective because an indictment must present facts and reasoning that persuade a judge or grand jury that there is probable cause to believe that the described conduct meets a criminal standard. When the first indictment of foreign state-linked hackers was unsealed in 2014, the challenge of attributing cyber incidents to foreign actors was still widely seen as being nearly insurmountable. When the U.S. government started to publicly attribute cyber attacks, it faced significant pushback and criticism not only by the accused but also by the tech community in the United States. Over time, these indictments helped demonstrate, with an unprecedented level of detail about foreign governments  cyber operations for public releases from government sources about specific cases of state-linked cyber activity, that attribution is indeed possible. (For a detailed discussion of criminal charges as a tool for attribution, see Chimène Keitner s recent article on the subject.)Attribution can transition into a second purpose disruption because indictments name specific hackers or operators. In most cases, criminally charging foreign state-linked individuals does not lead to arrest (one notable exception being when Canadian authorities arrested the hacker Karim Baratov for aiding in the 2014 Yahoo hack). Proxies collaborating with U.S. adversaries might decide that the costs of their association have become too high, particularly the cost of risking arrest anytime they travel to one of the more than 100 countries with which the U.S. has concluded an extradition treaty. (However, it is hard to judge whether this has happened since there have not been detailed follow-ups about many of the charged individuals who remain abroad.) States may reach the same conclusion regarding proxies that have been  outed  by criminal charges.Further, the individual-centric attribution that indictments provide undermines a core goal of many hackers: secrecy. One of the main reasons states turn to hacking is secrecy, and while an indictment may prompt skilled hackers to up their tradecraft and more skillfully avoid attribution in the future, for hackers the U.S. attribution capability may pose a fearsome barrier to surmount and may thus deter further actions on their part.Third, criminal charges can complement other U.S. government actions responding to state-sponsored hacking. The Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on individuals and companies named in foreign hacking indictments, like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)-linked hackers named in the 2016 indictment for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the U.S. financial sector, as well as the GRU operatives named in indictments in 2018. The same week that the Justice Department indicted the Chinese semiconductor firm Fujian Jinhua for funding a scheme to steal U.S. chip designs, the Commerce Department, acting under its own statutory authority, banned Fujian Jinhua from receiving exports of U.S. chip components, cutting off its supplies.Fourth, when criminal charges do lead to arrests and penalties, they punish those responsible for a cybercrime and provide some psychological restitution for the victims of their crimes. Simply knowing that law enforcement has investigated and charged those responsible counters the perception that there is no accountability or justice for state-backed hackers. This can have a beneficial effect on domestic constituencies arrests can provide a measure of redress for victims to know a perpetrator was identified. Moreover, public charging documents also help validate the work of cybersecurity defenders, who in many cases make their own attributions of major cyber incidents. The credibility these defenders get from having their attributions backed up by the U.S. government makes it easier for them to work with future victims and act as a front line against state-backed intrusions.Fifth, the deterrent power of criminal charges is the dimension where expectations often exceed practical effects. The record so far suggests that bringing criminal charges against foreign hackers and online influence operators does not impose enough costs on adversaries to convince them to cease from further malicious activity. Deterring some state activity as well as individual hackers, as states must factor the cost of attribution or arrests of their hackers or proxies into their calculations. In this way, the operational costs of criminal charges contribute to partial deterrence of the state s broader activities, as state-backed hackers might follow much stricter operational security procedures to avoid detection by U.S. law enforcement.Bringing criminal charges has also increasingly become a way to denounce malicious cyber activity in concert with U.S. allies. When the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Canada attributed the hacking of the World Anti-Doping Agency and the OPCW to the GRU, the Justice Department timed the unsealing of an indictment against several GRU officers for the same offenses to coordinate the denunciations.Lastly, criminal charges contribute to the growing body of state practice related to cyber norms. They provide clear evidence of what types of activities the United States views as unacceptable, enhancing U.S. efforts to build international cyber norms. While some might argue that the routine violation of these norms by states like North Korea and Russia could undermine these efforts, the U.S. has worked to build support for its condemnations of their activity among U.S. allies and other nations. And, over time, the record of indictments may contribute to the formation of customary international law and new norms, such as the proposed norm against foreign cyber-enabled election interference endorsed by the G-7 in 2018.Policy ConsiderationsPolicymakers looking to use criminal charges as foreign policy instruments face considerations and trade-offs that can limit the effectiveness of and raise potential risks with future uses of indictments.First, consider the questions that Justice Department prosecutors and policymakers bringing foreign hacking charges face: Is there a chance that the indictment will lead to an arrest? Are any targets in a country that has an extradition treaty with the U.S. and if so, are they prominent public figures or foreign government officers or officials and how will their governments react when they are arrested? How high up the chain of command is the target?Another risk with criminal charges is whether the risk of revealing U.S. intelligence sources and methods from information revealed in a charging document outweighs the possible benefit. Since criminal charges require a public stipulation of facts, policymakers and prosecutors must decide what they are willing to reveal while preserving any potentially sensitive means through which the evidence was obtained. But waiting until the relevant sources go dry or methods fall out of use reduces the impact that criminal charges are likely to have, as individual hackers are likely to have changed their behaviors and may not be working with the foreign government at that point.In addition, using criminal charges for foreign policy purposes raises the risk that governments will respond in kind and detain U.S. government employees or U.S. nationals. Former National Security Agency security scientist Dave Aitel expressedserious concern about that type of retaliation on Lawfare in 2016. And in other contexts, China has detained foreign nationals to respond to their governments  arrests of Chinese citizens. For instance, Chinese authorities have detained Canadian citizen Michael Kovrig in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada s arrest of Meng Wanzhou pursuant to a U.S. extradition request. It appears likely that China and Russia would apply the same logic of retaliation in response to a U.S. arrest of one of their hackers.The Justice Department s process for developing cases and bringing criminal charges is traditionally independent from political considerations. For policymakers hoping to gain some of the benefits discussed above for instance, providing redress to victims domestically or denouncing malicious activity in concert with foreign allies that independence can pose barriers to coordination across the federal government. (While the Department of Justice informally consults with other agencies about politically sensitive charges, it maintains that only it has final say when bringing them.) Accused foreign governments have responded to charges by arguing that they are political actions, saying the U.S. is attempting to worsen relations with them.This leads to a broader consideration about the impact that the charging strategy may have on multinational law enforcement efforts to combat international cybercrime. In recent years, the U.S. and Europe have been increasingly worried about the politicization of international law enforcement efforts and institutions by countries such as Russia. Even if Washington does not use criminal charges against foreign hackers and other foreigners engaged in state-linked malicious behavior in apolitical fashion, its adversaries may act more aggressively to politicize international law enforcement in an effort to undermine cooperation on combating cybercrime. Further, they may specifically push back against U.S. allies that aid its law enforcement efforts especially for cases where the U.S. asks its allies to assist in highly sensitive investigations, such as the arrest in Vancouver of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou. Other U.S. allies might face the choice of cooperating with U.S. law enforcement and risking losing their relationships with states like China or jeopardizing their cooperation efforts with the U.S.Lastly, in some cases of nation-state hacking, policymakers and prosecutors will have good reasons not to bring criminal charges, as discussed above. However, in those cases policymakers would have to turn to alternative means of condemning the behavior, such as sanctions or coordinated press releases from top officials (this was the response to the NotPetya ransomware attack). If there is no response, the U.S. could risk normalizing the behavior through tacit acceptance.Trends inCases to DatesThe 24 cases of international state-linked cybercrime and foreign influence operations that the Justice Department has charged show some clear trends relevant to the conceptual framework this post lays out. First, the diplomatic effects were heavily context dependent. For instance, according to U.S. analysts, the 2014 indictment of People s Liberation Army (PLA) hackers contributed to the 2015 U.S.-China cyber espionage deal as part of a broader pressure campaign, but amid the 2018 trade war, reports emerged that China had resumed its intellectual property theft. The U.S. responded with a series of criminal charges to put increased pressure on China, all of which have been part of the  China Initiative  that then-Attorney General Jeff Session announced in November 2018. The context for the hacking charges has now merged with the broader trade war especially now with the related charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou.Hacking charges that provided original attribution have had significant beneficial effects. For instance, the indictment of several Iranians for targeting banks in the U.S. clearly communicated to the U.S. public and the financial institutions that Iran had orchestrated the attacks. The OPCW indictment helped to mobilize U.S. allies to condemn Russia s malign activities. And interestingly, the U.S. government has done all of its attributions of Chinese trade secret theft through criminal charges. Trade secret theft is the most common type of activity that all foreign hacking criminal charges allege.Although protection of critical infrastructure is at the top of the U.S. government s cybersecurity priorities, only two indictments the 2016 Iran indictment and the 2018 SamSam ransomware indictment have involved attacks against critical infrastructure entities (counting election infrastructure as a separate category). This is somewhat curious given widespread reports of intrusions into critical infrastructure. One potential risk is that criminal charges for critical infrastructure hacking would provide a road map for future attempts and especially if they did not lead to any arrests, adversaries could perceive it as an announcement of vulnerability. This may suggest that criminal charges are better suited to respond to trade secret theft than critical infrastructure hacking.Finally, in the past two years, the number of public criminal charges has grown at an increasing pace. Yet, it is worth noting that criminal charges take time to prepare, often years; many of the charges unsealed in 2018 likely started as investigations back in the Obama administration. The pace is therefore likely to diminish somewhat, although the Department of Justice clearly has made an effort to develop its capacity to investigate such cases and to continue to bring them forward in the future. And with every new set of charges, adversaries come to expect them, factoring them into their plans, and the marginal effectiveness as a means of diplomatic pressure decreases. When criminal charges become commonplace, their value is lessened.OutlookWhen the Justice Department unsealed the first foreign hacking indictment in 2014, many doubted that the U.S. had and was willing to use a robust attribution capability. No more. The question is now, what comes after attribution? As our conceptual framework shows, foreign hacking charges have a number of ways of advancing U.S. interests including in the diplomatic arena and as a response to domestic pressure to  do something.  Further, in recent years, the interagency policy process has clearly deliberated on how to use existing policy tools and how to build additional ones from indictments, such as sanctions and export controls, and those are a good start in the right direction.Many observers have questioned the worth of the charging strategy by arguing that it has not improved  cyber deterrence.  That is to reject the charging strategy for the wrong reason for many of the reasons discussed above, but also because that view avoids addressing many of the other consequences that criminal charges against foreign hackers raise. It also masks some of the positive aspects of the charges where they have more potential to aid U.S. policies, namely as tools of disruption. One promising area is their effects against proxies against which the U.S. has made some successful arrests and for which criminal charges might sufficiently dissuade hackers from cooperating with hostile states. This disruptive effect may also contribute to limited disruption on an operational level as states experience more costs to avoid attribution.Some of the confusion about the worth of criminal charges is the result of built-up expectations, partly fueled by statements of U.S. government officials and press coverage. For example, the 2014 PLA indictment has been highlighted as a key part of a U.S. strategy to bring Beijing to the table and agree to a strategic commitment limiting cyber-enabled economic espionage in 2015. Since then, charges have not led to similar results, although the Department of Justice s press conferences continually trumpeted them as a key instrument in the government s toolbox to deter malicious cyber activity. There is also the analytical challenge that while charges often become public, their disruptive effects or lack thereof may remain classified and unknown to the public.In this vein, criminal charges have fit well with the Trump administration s efforts to adopt a  Peace Through Strength  approach to cyberspace, as the 2017 National Security Strategy outlined. However, this strategy risks undermining itself if public perceptions about charges continue to exceed their (known) impact. Importantly, the Department of Justice should make sure not to overstate the impact of the criminal charges on adversary states which would also help it avoid having them become perceived as a purely foreign policy tool.Criminal charges against foreign hackers should be framed as  persistent law enforcement  continued efforts to disrupt and deter hackers. Charges are valuable in this framework as a type of routine action, one that states should come to expect as the cost of using hackers for their ends. To build on this, one key policy goal should be encouraging other countries to do the same. By doing so, the U.S. would develop criminal charges as a standard response to state-linked hacking and contribute to broader efforts to encourage holding states responsible for their behavior in cyberspace.In light of the diminishing returns of continuously bringing charges against state-linked hackers, the U.S. government should develop a more tailored strategy carefully considering which types of behavior that law enforcement actions are best suited to address and then focus on bringing charges against those specific activities. More broadly, policymakers should consider what message they intend to send with a set of criminal charges in terms of international norms and clarify how charges contribute to U.S. efforts to build cyber norms. Upholding the rule of law in cyberspace will require a careful approach to foreign hacking charges that recognizes they have more ends than just deterrence.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.lawfareblog.com/whats-point-charging-foreign-state-linked-hackersContact Information:Garrett Hinck, Tim MaurerTags:,            Cybersecurity Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: May 27, 2019End of Document

And they are there on the Floor with our appropriations bill."I just want to start off the morning to say that Leader McConnell seems to take great pride in calling himself the Grim Reaper. It's part of his political campaign. It's part of the pride he takes as Leader of the Senate. And as you see what he wants to bury, none of these things are going to pass. They won't even be voted on. 'So, think of me as the Grim Reaper,' his own quote."He wants to bury the For The People Act for cleaner government. The Equality Act for ending discrimination against the LGBTQ community. Dreamers, to protect our Dreamers and TPS recipients. Paycheck Fairness, equal pay for equal work. Gun violence protection, commonsense background check legislation, he's burying that. Climate Action Now. Climate Action Now, let's bury that. Save the Internet Act, the net neutrality legislation young people are so concerned about. The Violence Against Women Act won't even get a vote. Lowering health care and prescription drug prices won't even get a vote."That's what he said about our agenda, which encompasses most of our early legislation on what we promised For The People: to lower the cost of health care by lowering the cost of prescription drugs, by building infrastructure of America in a green way, and in doing so, increasing paychecks. Lower health care, bigger paychecks, cleaner government. Not even going to get a vote."Again, 'Public sentiment is everything,' President Lincoln. The Senate will certainly be hearing from the public on issues, values really, that have bipartisan support across America. This is our attempt to find our common ground. So many of these issues, whether it's gun safety or violence against women and the rest, rank very high across the board, across party, across party lines."Right now, I'm very proud that on the Floor of the House, as a former Appropriator, the Appropriations Committee is putting forth legislation that reflects our values to meet the needs of the American people. Already we have addressed issues like raising the funding for the National Institutes of Health, investing further in early childhood education, we are talking about. And that's in Rosa DeLauro's bill, Health and Human Services and Education and Labor legislation. We heard from Mr. Visclosky on the Defense bill."So, we're talking about a strong America, strong in our national security, our national defense, and strong in the health and education and well-being of the American people."I would love just to read to you all the provisions of the legislation, but they're there for you to see, and we'll be talking about them, enlarging those issues as to what they mean to the American people."So that is part of our legislate, investigate, litigate agenda. We're doing this, and at the same time we are honoring our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."Yesterday, the President gave us, once again, evidence that he does not know right from wrong. It's a very sad thing, very sad thing that he does not know right from wrong. I believe that he has been involved in a criminal coverup - I've said that before - and our investigation is demonstrating that. The Mueller Report showed obstruction of justice in at least 10, perhaps 11 places."But for the President to be so cavalier, to disregard, to be indifferent to law and any sense of ethics about who we are as a country, to say he would invite foreign intervention further. The Intelligence Community with great confidence has put forth that the Russians interfered in our election. That's an assault on our democracy, an assault on our democracy. This President says it's a hoax."He takes an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, but I guess it doesn't include him in terms of being - to be held accountable to obey the law."So, we have a package that we're putting forth in light of the Mueller Report, a package of legislation, duty to report if someone comes to you, mandating that campaigns report foreign offers of assistance. It shouldn't even - I mean, it's so self-evident as a matter of ethics, but we'll have to codify it, mandating a duty to report for campaigns reporting foreign interventions in our elections."Protecting our elections with paper ballots, that's our election security bill that Zoe Lofgren is working on. And she is working with the Senate, hoping to have bipartisan support in the House for our legislation to protect our electoral system."Closing foreign money loopholes, that's Mr. Sarbanes' bill post the Mueller Report. And Mr. Thompson will be having a hearing in the Homeland Security Committee about preventing foreign disinformation. That is just a sample of some of the things that will be out there."I believe we're making good progress on oversight. Our Chairmen are doing a great job. I'm so proud of them. They're winning in the courts and winning documents from the Justice Department with the thought of contempt or following up on subpoenas. And we're going to get the truth for the American people so that they can know what the attack is on our country, what the President refused to do about it, and what he engaged in to cover up what was done."There are so many things happening. I just want to refer to one thing, in Hong Kong. As many of you know, or some of you do anyway, the issue of China has been an important one for me since Tiananmen Square, even before, but in terms of public policy here in the Congress since Tiananmen Square. On June 4, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the massacre in Tiananmen Square."At the same time, we're observing that the Chinese Government is engaged in arresting millions of Uyghurs and putting them into education camps, that they're diminishing the democracy in Hong Kong, trying to really just eliminate the culture, the language, the religion in Tibet. The list goes on and on."But right now, currently, as we gather here, in Hong Kong, as you know, in the last few days hundreds of thousands, if not a million people gathered in the street to protest an extradition law that the Chinese Government wants the Hong Kong Government to pass. It's such a horrible, horribly dangerous piece of legislation."I'm very pleased to be supporting legislation that Senator Marco Rubio and Chris Smith on the Republican side, Jim McGovern and I on our side, and others are putting forth to improve and modernize the Hong Kong-U.S. Relations Act - U.S.-Hong Kong Relations Act - and that is going to be submitted today. They're just finalizing it, perhaps being submitted today."But this is so wrong. And I do hope that the President will speak about human rights in China and freedoms in China when he talks about trade with the Chinese. I am pleased with Secretary Pompeo's statement on what's happening in China now in this regard."With that, I'll take any questions you have."***Q: Speaker Pelosi?Speaker Pelosi. Yes, ma'am. You always sit right there. So, Nancy gets it.Q: That's the strategy.When it comes to this issue of opposition research, what would you do if a House Democrats accepted assistance, campaign assistance, from a foreign power?Speaker Pelosi. Well, we're saying it should be against the law. It's so against any sense of decency.But, let me give you an example. Perhaps you don't know this or maybe you do, but to remind - in 2000, when the race was between Senator Gore and Governor Bush, Tom Downey - former Member of Congress, close friend of Al Gore - was playing George Bush in the prep - in the debate prep - and somebody threw over the transom or under the door, whatever place it came, the plans for the Bush campaign in the debates - in the debates.They just got that to Tom Downey. He picked it up and sent it to the FBI. This isn't even foreign governments. This isn't even foreign governments.That's what you do. There is a sense of decency about fruit from the forbidden tree, ill-gotten gain about what - again - how President, then Governor, Bush would have conducted that debate.This is so - and just by dint of your question, with all due respect, you make it sound like it could be a common thing - it is not.And, what the President said last night shows clearly, once again, over and over again, that he does not know the difference between right and wrong. And that's probably the nicest thing I could say about him because, if he does not know the difference, that could explain some of his ridiculous behavior.And now, to invite further involvement of foreign governments into our election - there was an assault on our democracy, an assault on our country by the Russians. That has been clearly documented by the Intelligence Community and the President of United States, instead of coming to the defense of our democracy, has said it's a hoax.This is beyond - it's really, there is no sense of - what's the word I want to find - of any ethical sense that informs his comments and his thinking.Q: Madam Speaker, I want to make sure we understand what you're saying because you're going to be pushing for legislation here. Are you saying - it is clear now whether this is illegal, whether it's wrong, is it illegal to take this kind of information? And, in addition, one of your Members, at least, is saying this is impeachable - this attitude by the President - do you believe that this is impeachable?Speaker Pelosi. There is in the law that you cannot accept contributions and that includes in-kind from a foreign government - your campaign cannot. That is in the law but if it needs more clarity then we will go the duty to report. That is not only you don't accept it but you report it to the FBI because this is - it is an invasion of our democracy. I don't have the language right here but there is language in the law that prohibits any contribution, and again, contribution is in-kind, information or whatever that is but we want to make sure that it has more clarity and carries a responsibility to report.Q: Madam Speaker, if you discover - we are already in campaign season - if you discover that this President over the course of the 2020 campaign accepted help from a foreign government as he suggested that he might, would you consider that grounds to launching impeachment proceedings?Speaker Pelosi. It has nothing to do with any campaign. I want to make sure you all understand that. We go down this path to seek the truth for the American people and to hold the President accountable. It has nothing to do with politics or any campaigns. It has everything to do with - it has everything to do with - excuse me, if I may answer your question. It has everything to do with patriotism, not partisanship. As we collect facts and it takes time because you have to do your research, make your request, if you go to court, you have to do the accommodation - do you know what that is? It takes time to prove that you have tried to resolve the issue and that takes time and that is the path we will be. And it encompasses any and all of the comments that the President has made.Q: Can I just clarify though -Speaker Pelosi. It is all women in the front. I am so excited about that![Laughter]Q: If the President is inviting foreign interference, why is that not grounds to move toward impeachment? And what grounds would you take to prevent him from impeachment?Speaker Pelosi. Everybody in the country should be totally appalled by what the President said last night. Everybody should be appalled, but he has a habit of making appalling statements. This one borders on so totally unethical that he doesn't even realize it.However, what we want to do is have a methodical approach to the path that we are on and this will be included in that. But not any one issue is going to trigger - 'Oh now we'll go do this.' It's about investigating, it's about litigating, it's about getting the truth to hold everyone accountable, and no one is above the law.But, I want to get back to our legislation, because that is what the American people elected us to do. They elected us to - For The People agenda, to increase paychecks, lower health care costs, have cleaner government. Many of these pieces of legislation are in that.What is it about Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in Congress, that they do not want to respond to what is so popular across the board in our country?To take it back to your question, what is it about the Republicans in Congress, how much more of the President's unethical behavior can they bear, that they think they're honoring their oath of office?And I believe all of these things are connected. It's all about money. Connect the dots, in all of this. It's all about money. And look at what the President's doing in Saudi Arabia with the sale of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.Follow the money! Who benefits from that? To declare a national emergency that he can bypass Congress in terms of those sales. Bypass the law in terms of transferring nuclear technology to a country. Follow the money.Q: Madam Speaker?Speaker Pelosi. Yes, Chad.Q: Thank you. Good morning.On this issue of a COLA increase, is there, number one, a problem with the idea that people come here and because the pay isn't satisfactory they then go off Capitol Hill and go to K Street and that entails corruption?And, why is it so hard, naturally, to then take a vote on this because it's so toxic for a regular pay raise or a COLA increase? And is that appropriate at this time when people, you know, themselves back home in the Midwest or out West need more money?Speaker Pelosi. Well, it's hard at any time.It's not a pay raise. It's a COLA increase. And whether that comes to be, I don't know. It would have to be a bipartisan initiative, if it were to be the case.And, as you know, Mr. Hoyer feels very strongly, in support of strengthening this institution, that there should be a recognition with a COLA of the work that is done.Let me just say, listening to the Members - because it's never a good time to bring up something like this - there is a sentiment in the country that Congress should not be just, Members, people who can afford to go to Congress. It should be about everybody having the opportunity, many more women, many more people of color and the rest, and that that is where some of the unease comes from that people say it shouldn't be just for wealthy people.Well, it isn't just for wealthy people, but there is that impression. And there is an impression among Members that it's hard to have two homes, raise a family and all the rest. So that's part of what the discussion is.I don't see it as any - what did you say? You relate it to going to K Street? No, I think - what I think is an issue in our country is the revolving door, largely spinning madly in the executive branch, as we see it now.Look at the people in the Departments - the Secretaries in the Cabinet. They're all connected to the special interests. So many of them have left already in disgrace, dismay or disappointment.But you see their connection, whether it's EPA, Interior, you name the list - there's so much connection to the - when I say private sector, I don't want to paint everyone with the same brush, but to special interest - I'll paint that in there.So, this whole issue of this revolving door is a separate issue and something that has to be looked into, but as we have inclusion, and that is an important value.Q: Well, what is this disconnect with the public? The House was in till 4:01 this morning -Speaker Pelosi. Yeah.Q: And most people back home say, 'Oh, Congress doesn't get any work done, nothing happens.'I know you're talking about the graveyard here. But that said, you know, the public doesn't think that Congress gets things done, and the House was in till 4 o'clock in the morning. The Defense markup was quite late last night as well -Speaker Pelosi. No, till 7 o'clock this morning.Q: But that's my point - why does the public perceive this differently and that's why they're opposed to a COLA increase and Members are afraid if they vote for that, they're going to get hammered?Speaker Pelosi. I don't think that this is - look, we have a President who is ignoring the law, not honoring his oath of office, not honoring the office that he holds.We have a funding challenge that we have, which is something that must be done - by the end of the fiscal year, we must pass the appropriations bills.I'm an appropriator. Left to our own devices, I believe, as I've said to you before, that the appropriators in a bipartisan way can reach solutions. We're still having the caps fight, the lifting of the debt ceiling.We have the President transferring nuclear technology as well as other weaponry to a country that is getting away with murder and he chooses to ignore it, is engaged in a deadly war in Yemen, which the Congress opposes.So, we have important policy matter to deal with - I think I've spent enough time on speculating as to whether there will be something or not, which we don't know if there will be.Q: Madam Speaker?Speaker Pelosi. Yes, ma'am.Q: On the appropriations, at the end of the month, the Office of Refugee Resettlement said that they are going to run out of money to house unaccompanied migrants at the border. The Senate is going to mark up a bill next week on this issue.How do you think that the Senate and the House can bridge the divide given the fact that they had to drop this off of the disaster aid bill just a couple of weeks ago because they couldn't find agreement?Speaker Pelosi. They're working on it. There are two paths. One is in the appropriations bill, where we have the Homeland Security piece, which is part of the 2020 appropriations, and then the supplemental. We'll have to have a supplemental because the needs are so great.But, I have confidence that they will come to a conclusion on it. We have to - the humanitarian needs are very great there, and we care very much about that and we don't want them to poison pill what we're trying to do to alleviate that humanitarian challenge.I mean, really, taking children out of the arms of their mother, separating families?How could it be, as people of faith that believe in the spark of divinity in every person, that we're all God's children, that we could treat people the way they do? But, we will have to come to an agreement to get the bill passed and signed by the President.Q: Can it be done by the end of the month?Speaker Pelosi. Oh, I think so. Yeah, I hope so. I mean, we're on that path.Yes, ma'am.Q: In order to pass legislation, you're going to have to work with this President. I don't see infrastructure on your board. Going back to the infrastructure meeting a few weeks ago, looking back, was it a good idea in that moment, right before you walked in, to accuse the President of a criminal cover-up before you were trying to get a deal done for the American public?Speaker Pelosi. These are bills that have passed the House.Q: I know. Yeah.Speaker Pelosi. These are bills that have passed the House. We are not giving up on infrastructure.And I say almost every day that the President is involved in a criminal cover-up. He just chose to pick it up that day. So there was nothing new about anything I said about the President at that time. I think the President just didn't want to pay for it.The purpose of that meeting was we're going to do infrastructure: build the infrastructure in our country - which I truly believe he wants to do - build the infrastructure of our country in a green way - I'm not sure about that - to raise the paychecks of the American worker.And to do so in a way - infrastructure is a national security issue, as President Eisenhower so beautifully demonstrated in the '50s when he instituted the Interstate Highway System as a national security issue to unify America.So, I don't take any responsibility for the President's behavior, except to say that we're going to hold him accountable for it.Q: Budget caps question?Speaker Pelosi. Yes, sir.Q: I understand the White House is floating some new offers to Democrats that were going to review it. Have you seen that? Do you have any comment on how the talks are -Speaker Pelosi. I don't know what that is. What are you referencing?Q: Apparently Mnuchin was in with McConnell making offers last night and wanting to run something by you, so I just -Speaker Pelosi. Well, I don't know what it is so I can't tell you if I do, but I'll tell you where I see things.We do have to lift the budget caps. We have to avoid sequestration, because that is not a good idea for our country.We have to avoid shutdown of government, which is palatable to some Republicans who don't believe in governance, but we will not go down that path.And, we are going to combine - when we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling, but that would have to come second or simultaneous, but not before lifting the caps.I don't know what their proposal is, but I do know that when we've been engaged in conversation - Mitch and - Leader McConnell, and Leader Schumer and Mr. McCarthy and I, with the Secretary of the Treasury, we were making some progress. But then they kind of backed away from it. So, we'll see. I don't know what that one is.I'm not usually, shall we say - when Mick Mulvaney takes the lead - Mick Mulvaney was one of the leaders in shutting down government when he was here and voted to keep it closed, voted to keep it closed. And that was when we were operating on the Republican number that we said, 'We'll agree to it. We don't like it. We'll agree to it.' And they didn't agree to their own number.So I'm hopeful, always hopeful, always open. But I think, left to our own devices, we can get - I keep using that phrase because there is bipartisanship in all of this. We know what we have to do. We can get it done.It's when they come in with deal breakers because they don't believe in governance, they don't believe in science - which says evidence, data, truth, fact, what we need to do for our country.So, if you don't accept that and you don't believe in governance then you have a different approach to all of this.Okay.Are you ready for game time tonight? See my yellow jacket?[Laughter]Golden State Warriors - game time.Q: You made a bet with Justin Trudeau.Speaker Pelosi. I did. I made a bet with Justin Trudeau after it was 3 1.Now, I didn't want to bring it up in Normandy, that wouldn't have been appropriate.[Laughter]That wasn't the time or the place, but the next day - the next day we made our bet. Can't wait to see what those goodies are from Canada.[Laughter]Q: Poutine?Speaker Pelosi. Say what?Q: Poutine, perhaps?Speaker Pelosi. Is that what they'll have?Q: I don't know. Maybe.Speaker Pelosi. I think that it will be - see, my advantage is - my advantage, apart from the Golden State Warriors, my advantage is that I'm the Speaker of the House, but my bet is from California. So, walnuts and almonds and chocolate and wine.His advantage is he's the Prime Minister of Canada, so he has to have a representative supply. I don't have to do the whole country. I can just do California. So, I'm eager to see what he sends.Game time.Q: Thank you. Good luck.Speaker Pelosi. Thank you.Copyright Targeted News Servicesnull-6759994 TeamManagerLoad-Date: June 15, 2019End of Document

TRANSCRIPT OF PELOSI WEEKLY PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY JUNE 13, 2019States News ServiceJune 13, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 3910 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Office of the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi:Speaker Nancy Pelosi held her weekly press conference today in the Capitol Visitor Center. Below are the Speaker's remarks:Speaker Pelosi. Good morning.Here we are, continuing a late night into the next morning. I always say to the Members, 'Let's see who can hoot with the owls and soar with the eagles early the next morning.' And they are there on the Floor with our appropriations bill.I just want to start off the morning to say that Leader McConnell seems to take great pride in calling himself the Grim Reaper. It's part of his political campaign. It's part of the pride he takes as Leader of the Senate. And as you see what he wants to bury, none of these things are going to pass. They won't even be voted on. 'So, think of me as the Grim Reaper,' his own quote.He wants to bury the For The People Act for cleaner government. The Equality Act for ending discrimination against the LGBTQ community. Dreamers, to protect our Dreamers and TPS recipients. Paycheck Fairness, equal pay for equal work. Gun violence protection, commonsense background check legislation, he's burying that. Climate Action Now. Climate Action Now, let's bury that. Save the Internet Act, the net neutrality legislation young people are so concerned about. The Violence Against Women Act won't even get a vote. Lowering health care and prescription drug prices won't even get a vote.That's what he said about our agenda, which encompasses most of our early legislation on what we promised For The People: to lower the cost of health care by lowering the cost of prescription drugs, by building infrastructure of America in a green way, and in doing so, increasing paychecks. Lower health care, bigger paychecks, cleaner government. Not even going to get a vote.Again, 'Public sentiment is everything,' President Lincoln. The Senate will certainly be hearing from the public on issues, values really, that have bipartisan support across America. This is our attempt to find our common ground. So many of these issues, whether it's gun safety or violence against women and the rest, rank very high across the board, across party, across party lines.Right now, I'm very proud that on the Floor of the House, as a former Appropriator, the Appropriations Committee is putting forth legislation that reflects our values to meet the needs of the American people. Already we have addressed issues like raising the funding for the National Institutes of Health, investing further in early childhood education, we are talking about. And that's in Rosa DeLauro's bill, Health and Human Services and Education and Labor legislation. We heard from Mr. Visclosky on the Defense bill.So, we're talking about a strong America, strong in our national security, our national defense, and strong in the health and education and well-being of the American people.I would love just to read to you all the provisions of the legislation, but they're there for you to see, and we'll be talking about them, enlarging those issues as to what they mean to the American people.So that is part of our legislate, investigate, litigate agenda. We're doing this, and at the same time we are honoring our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.Yesterday, the President gave us, once again, evidence that he does not know right from wrong. It's a very sad thing, very sad thing that he does not know right from wrong. I believe that he has been involved in a criminal coverup I've said that before and our investigation is demonstrating that. The Mueller Report showed obstruction of justice in at least 10, perhaps 11 places.But for the President to be so cavalier, to disregard, to be indifferent to law and any sense of ethics about who we are as a country, to say he would invite foreign intervention further. The Intelligence Community with great confidence has put forth that the Russians interfered in our election. That's an assault on our democracy, an assault on our democracy. This President says it's a hoax.He takes an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, but I guess it doesn't include him in terms of being to be held accountable to obey the law.So, we have a package that we're putting forth in light of the Mueller Report, a package of legislation, duty to report if someone comes to you, mandating that campaigns report foreign offers of assistance. It shouldn't even I mean, it's so self-evident as a matter of ethics, but we'll have to codify it, mandating a duty to report for campaigns reporting foreign interventions in our elections.Protecting our elections with paper ballots, that's our election security bill that Zoe Lofgren is working on. And she is working with the Senate, hoping to have bipartisan support in the House for our legislation to protect our electoral system.Closing foreign money loopholes, that's Mr. Sarbanes' bill post the Mueller Report. And Mr. Thompson will be having a hearing in the Homeland Security Committee about preventing foreign disinformation. That is just a sample of some of the things that will be out there.I believe we're making good progress on oversight. Our Chairmen are doing a great job. I'm so proud of them. They're winning in the courts and winning documents from the Justice Department with the thought of contempt or following up on subpoenas. And we're going to get the truth for the American people so that they can know what the attack is on our country, what the President refused to do about it, and what he engaged in to cover up what was done.There are so many things happening. I just want to refer to one thing, in Hong Kong. As many of you know, or some of you do anyway, the issue of China has been an important one for me since Tiananmen Square, even before, but in terms of public policy here in the Congress since Tiananmen Square. On June 4, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the massacre in Tiananmen Square.At the same time, we're observing that the Chinese Government is engaged in arresting millions of Uyghurs and putting them into education camps, that they're diminishing the democracy in Hong Kong, trying to really just eliminate the culture, the language, the religion in Tibet. The list goes on and on.But right now, currently, as we gather here, in Hong Kong, as you know, in the last few days hundreds of thousands, if not a million people gathered in the street to protest an extradition law that the Chinese Government wants the Hong Kong Government to pass. It's such a horrible, horribly dangerous piece of legislation.I'm very pleased to be supporting legislation that Senator Marco Rubio and Chris Smith on the Republican side, Jim McGovern and I on our side, and others are putting forth to improve and modernize the Hong Kong-U.S. Relations Act U.S.-Hong Kong Relations Act and that is going to be submitted today. They're just finalizing it, perhaps being submitted today.But this is so wrong. And I do hope that the President will speak about human rights in China and freedoms in China when he talks about trade with the Chinese. I am pleased with Secretary Pompeo's statement on what's happening in China now in this regard.With that, I'll take any questions you have.***Q: Speaker Pelosi?Speaker Pelosi. Yes, ma'am.

It has nothing to do with politics or any campaigns. It has everything to do with it has everything to do with excuse me, if I may answer your question. It has everything to do with patriotism, not partisanship. As we collect facts and it takes time because you have to do your research, make your request, if you go to court, you have to do the accommodation do you know what that is? It takes time to prove that you have tried to resolve the issue and that takes time and that is the path we will be. And it encompasses any and all of the comments that the President has made.Q: Can I just clarify thoughSpeaker Pelosi. It is all women in the front. I am so excited about that![Laughter]Q: If the President is inviting foreign interference, why is that not grounds to move toward impeachment? And what grounds would you take to prevent him from impeachment?Speaker Pelosi. Everybody in the country should be totally appalled by what the President said last night. Everybody should be appalled, but he has a habit of making appalling statements. This one borders on so totally unethical that he doesn't even realize it.However, what we want to do is have a methodical approach to the path that we are on and this will be included in that. But not any one issue is going to trigger 'Oh now we'll go do this.' It's about investigating, it's about litigating, it's about getting the truth to hold everyone accountable, and no one is above the law.But, I want to get back to our legislation, because that is what the American people elected us to do. They elected us to For The People agenda, to increase paychecks, lower health care costs, have cleaner government. Many of these pieces of legislation are in that.What is it about Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in Congress, that they do not want to respond to what is so popular across the board in our country?To take it back to your question, what is it about the Republicans in Congress, how much more of the President's unethical behavior can they bear, that they think they're honoring their oath of office?And I believe all of these things are connected. It's all about money. Connect the dots, in all of this. It's all about money. And look at what the President's doing in Saudi Arabia with the sale of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.Follow the money! Who benefits from that? To declare a national emergency that he can bypass Congress in terms of those sales. Bypass the law in terms of transferring nuclear technology to a country. Follow the money.Q: Madam Speaker?Speaker Pelosi. Yes, Chad.Q: Thank you. Good morning.On this issue of a COLA increase, is there, number one, a problem with the idea that people come here and because the pay isn't satisfactory they then go off Capitol Hill and go to K Street and that entails corruption?And, why is it so hard, naturally, to then take a vote on this because it's so toxic for a regular pay raise or a COLA increase? And is that appropriate at this time when people, you know, themselves back home in the Midwest or out West need more money?Speaker Pelosi. Well, it's hard at any time.It's not a pay raise. It's a COLA increase. And whether that comes to be, I don't know. It would have to be a bipartisan initiative, if it were to be the case.And, as you know, Mr. Hoyer feels very strongly, in support of strengthening this institution, that there should be a recognition with a COLA of the work that is done.Let me just say, listening to the Members because it's never a good time to bring up something like this there is a sentiment in the country that Congress should not be just, Members, people who can afford to go to Congress. It should be about everybody having the opportunity, many more women, many more people of color and the rest, and that that is where some of the unease comes from that people say it shouldn't be just for wealthy people.Well, it isn't just for wealthy people, but there is that impression. And there is an impression among Members that it's hard to have two homes, raise a family and all the rest. So that's part of what the discussion is.I don't see it as any what did you say? You relate it to going to K Street? No, I think what I think is an issue in our country is the revolving door, largely spinning madly in the executive branch, as we see it now.Look at the people in the Departments the Secretaries in the Cabinet. They're all connected to the special interests. So many of them have left already in disgrace, dismay or disappointment.But you see their connection, whether it's EPA, Interior, you name the list there's so much connection to the when I say private sector, I don't want to paint everyone with the same brush, but to special interest I'll paint that in there.So, this whole issue of this revolving door is a separate issue and something that has to be looked into, but as we have inclusion, and that is an important value.Q: Well, what is this disconnect with the public? The House was in till 4:01 this morningSpeaker Pelosi. Yeah.Q: And most people back home say, 'Oh, Congress doesn't get any work done, nothing happens.'I know you're talking about the graveyard here. But that said, you know, the public doesn't think that Congress gets things done, and the House was in till 4 o'clock in the morning. The Defense markup was quite late last night as wellSpeaker Pelosi. No, till 7 o'clock this morning.Q: But that's my point why does the public perceive this differently and that's why they're opposed to a COLA increase and Members are afraid if they vote for that, they're going to get hammered?Speaker Pelosi. I don't think that this is look, we have a President who is ignoring the law, not honoring his oath of office, not honoring the office that he holds.We have a funding challenge that we have, which is something that must be done by the end of the fiscal year, we must pass the appropriations bills.I'm an appropriator. Left to our own devices, I believe, as I've said to you before, that the appropriators in a bipartisan way can reach solutions. We're still having the caps fight, the lifting of the debt ceiling.We have the President transferring nuclear technology as well as other weaponry to a country that is getting away with murder and he chooses to ignore it, is engaged in a deadly war in Yemen, which the Congress opposes.So, we have important policy matter to deal with I think I've spent enough time on speculating as to whether there will be something or not, which we don't know if there will be.Q: Madam Speaker?Speaker Pelosi. Yes, ma'am.Q: On the appropriations, at the end of the month, the Office of Refugee Resettlement said that they are going to run out of money to house unaccompanied migrants at the border. The Senate is going to mark up a bill next week on this issue.How do you think that the Senate and the House can bridge the divide given the fact that they had to drop this off of the disaster aid bill just a couple of weeks ago because they couldn't find agreement?Speaker Pelosi. They're working on it. There are two paths. One is in the appropriations bill, where we have the Homeland Security piece, which is part of the 2020 appropriations, and then the supplemental. We'll have to have a supplemental because the needs are so great.But, I have confidence that they will come to a conclusion on it. We have to the humanitarian needs are very great there, and we care very much about that and we don't want them to poison pill what we're trying to do to alleviate that humanitarian challenge.I mean, really, taking children out of the arms of their mother, separating families?How could it be, as people of faith that believe in the spark of divinity in every person, that we're all God's children, that we could treat people the way they do? But, we will have to come to an agreement to get the bill passed and signed by the President.Q: Can it be done by the end of the month?Speaker Pelosi. Oh, I think so. Yeah, I hope so. I mean, we're on that path.Yes, ma'am.Q: In order to pass legislation, you're going to have to work with this President. I don't see infrastructure on your board. Going back to the infrastructure meeting a few weeks ago, looking back, was it a good idea in that moment, right before you walked in, to accuse the President of a criminal cover-up before you were trying to get a deal done for the American public?Speaker Pelosi. These are bills that have passed the House.Q: I know. Yeah.Speaker Pelosi. These are bills that have passed the House. We are not giving up on infrastructure.And I say almost every day that the President is involved in a criminal cover-up. He just chose to pick it up that day. So there was nothing new about anything I said about the President at that time. I think the President just didn't want to pay for it.The purpose of that meeting was we're going to do infrastructure: build the infrastructure in our country which I truly believe he wants to do build the infrastructure of our country in a green way I'm not sure about that to raise the paychecks of the American worker.And to do so in a way infrastructure is a national security issue, as President Eisenhower so beautifully demonstrated in the '50s when he instituted the Interstate Highway System as a national security issue to unify America.So, I don't take any responsibility for the President's behavior, except to say that we're going to hold him accountable for it.Q: Budget caps question?Speaker Pelosi. Yes, sir.Q: I understand the White House is floating some new offers to Democrats that were going to review it. Have you seen that? Do you have any comment on how the talks areSpeaker Pelosi. I don't know what that is. What are you referencing?Q: Apparently Mnuchin was in with McConnell making offers last night and wanting to run something by you, so I justSpeaker Pelosi. Well, I don't know what it is so I can't tell you if I do, but I'll tell you where I see things.We do have to lift the budget caps. We have to avoid sequestration, because that is not a good idea for our country.We have to avoid shutdown of government, which is palatable to some Republicans who don't believe in governance, but we will not go down that path.And, we are going to combine when we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling, but that would have to come second or simultaneous, but not before lifting the caps.I don't know what their proposal is, but I do know that when we've been engaged in conversation Mitch and Leader McConnell, and Leader Schumer and Mr. McCarthy and I, with the Secretary of the Treasury, we were making some progress. But then they kind of backed away from it. So, we'll see. I don't know what that one is.I'm not usually, shall we say when Mick Mulvaney takes the lead Mick Mulvaney was one of the leaders in shutting down government when he was here and voted to keep it closed, voted to keep it closed. And that was when we were operating on the Republican number that we said, 'We'll agree to it. We don't like it. We'll agree to it.' And they didn't agree to their own number.So I'm hopeful, always hopeful, always open. But I think, left to our own devices, we can get I keep using that phrase because there is bipartisanship in all of this. We know what we have to do. We can get it done.It's when they come in with deal breakers because they don't believe in governance, they don't believe in science which says evidence, data, truth, fact, what we need to do for our country.So, if you don't accept that and you don't believe in governance then you have a different approach to all of this.Okay.Are you ready for game time tonight? See my yellow jacket?[Laughter]Golden State Warriors game time.Q: You made a bet with Justin Trudeau.Speaker Pelosi. I did. I made a bet with Justin Trudeau after it was 3-1.Now, I didn't want to bring it up in Normandy, that wouldn't have been appropriate.[Laughter]That wasn't the time or the place, but the next day the next day we made our bet. Can't wait to see what those goodies are from Canada.[Laughter]Q: Poutine?Speaker Pelosi. Say what?Q: Poutine, perhaps?Speaker Pelosi. Is that what they'll have?Q: I don't know. Maybe.Speaker Pelosi. I think that it will be see, my advantage is my advantage, apart from the Golden State Warriors, my advantage is that I'm the Speaker of the House, but my bet is from California. So, walnuts and almonds and chocolate and wine.His advantage is he's the Prime Minister of Canada, so he has to have a representative supply. I don't have to do the whole country. I can just do California. So, I'm eager to see what he sends.Game time.Q: Thank you. Good luck.Speaker Pelosi. Thank you.Load-Date: June 13, 2019End of Document

The protectionism of TrumpCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 23, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 580 wordsBody The Financial / Gabriela Siller  There is uncertainty in the market due to the trade war between China and the United States, after Donald Trump announced measures blocking Chinese technology giant Huawei from doing business in the United States. This led to the weekend Google announced that it will stop updating the operating system of this company.  For Trump, Huawei represents China's ideology in business. It is a very large company that is not public. Its founder was a member of the army and it is said that his links with the Chinese Communist Party drove it to become the largest technology company in the world, a title that until 2017 belonged to Apple. Additionally, she has been accused by several US multinationals of conducting espionage for the Chinese government.  It should be noted that Huawei's consumer division represents 48.4 percent of its total sales and although Google has said that the operating system will continue to operate, it is not known what will happen when it has to be updated. As a result, it is highly probable that you will lose market. The measure makes clear that the trade war between the United States and China is far from over and that Trump wants to "hang the star" to increase the sales of US companies, using trade protectionism. The problem with the trade war is that it involves the two largest economies in the world and tariffs cause lower economic growth.  It is also important to remember that, in terms of trade and debt, the United States and China are very intertwined, since the United States has a trade deficit with China close to 420 billion dollars (4 times higher than the one it had with Mexico in 2018), while the Chinese government is the largest foreign holder of US Treasury bonds with 6.4 percent of the total outstanding.  The United States can continue to pressure China to achieve a better trade balance, but it must be careful, since the Chinese can make a massive sale of Treasury bonds and generate waves in the US financial market by raising the interest rate in the secondary market and cause this with a rapid economic slowdown and overdue portfolio in the US, among other problems that could occur.  Due to Trump's greater uncertainty and protectionist rhetoric, there is likely to be greater volatility in the financial markets during this week.  However, a very important aspect of Trump's rhetoric is that there seems to be a change, since on previous occasions he lashed out against all of his trading partners, especially China and Mexico. However, now it seems to be against China, but promoting trade with Mexico, since last week announced the elimination of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico and Canada. This may be evidence that Donald Trump is trying to get the T-MEC ratified as soon as possible. Thus, the volatility of the peso-dollar exchange rate could be lower than that registered with other currencies that are sensitive to external events, such as the trade war between the United States and China.  For Mexico, the elimination of tariffs on steel and aluminum represents a respite from the national economic slowdown, since Mexican exports of these commodities are expected to rise. Likewise, the employment of this sector can be increased when American companies come to manufacture steel products to Mexico to take advantage of the lower cost of labor.  The author is chief economist of Grupo Financiero BASE and professor of economics at Tec de Monterrey. Load-Date: May 23, 2019End of Document

DJI s newest drone is a $499 tank meant to teach kids how to codeiCrowdNewswire (English)June 12, 2019 Wednesday 11:50 AM GMTCopyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 880 wordsBody                   Dronemaker DJI has spent the last few years running a massive robotics competition in China called RoboMasters, where students build and code robots that do battle in a literal arena.

Continue reading DJI's newest drone is a $499 tank meant to teach kids how to codeDronemaker DJI has spent the last few years running a massive robotics competition in China called RoboMasters, where students build and code robots that do battle in a literal arena. Now, DJI wants to sell a more approachable version of that idea to kids in the US, Europe, and Japan, with an educational toy robot tank called the RoboMaster S1.The RoboMaster S1 is one part camera-equipped remote-controlled car, one part educational platform, and one part DJI flexing its fully mature hardware and software muscles. Available starting Wednesday for $499, the S1 can be driven using a mobile app, or coded to move on its own. It's equipped with 31 sensors that help it map its environment, and it can move in 360 degrees thanks to cleverly-designed wheels.It shoots gel beads and lasersMuch like DJI's newest drones, the S1 can recognize and respond to gestures and sounds, or track objects, all using computer vision. (It's equipped with a camera that has an f2.4 aperture and a wide 120-degree field of view, which streams its view over Wi-Fi to the mobile app.) But unlike DJI's drones, the S1 can shoot projectiles in the form of little gel bead bullets. These beads come in super small form but puff up once submerged in water for a few hours; they're nontoxic, but will require some cleanup after use.The RoboMaster S1 can also be driven with controller, though that will be sold separately in an add-on package that includes an extra battery and more gel beads, which will be available at a later date.The S1 was impressive during a short press briefing. It responds to controls with almost imperceptible lag, both in how it traverses across the floor and in how the head responds to aiming commands. DJI had us run through a few different types of use cases, including a race, where we not only had to beat our opponents, but were required to scan a series of images along the way in order to win.We also tested out the S1 robots in a  battle mode,  where we drove them around a makeshift arena. The person who scored the most points won (done by shooting opponents in the S1's LED-lit sensitive areas, just like in the real RoboMasters, though this can be done with gel beads or with lasers), and along the way there were chances to recharge health and gain special abilities by scanning special images set up around the arena.The S1 is DJI flexing its hardware and software musclesDJI believes the value of the S1, though, is that it will give kids outside of China a taste of what it's like to be a part of the RoboMasters competition. As such, the S1 is highly customizable, and made to be tinkered with. It comes disassembled, so kids have to put almost every piece together just to get started. They can write Scratch 3.0 or Python code to control things as granular as the torque of the wheels, allowing them to program the S1 to do all sorts of things, like pull off evasive maneuvers in battle (another echo of the competition).DJI has developed a suite of video tutorials and guides to help users learn how to do all this, even if they've never coded before.  The hope is that robotics will become a major sport, like football, basketball. That's our vision for this product,  Shuo Yang, the head of the S1 project, told Bloomberg.The S1 announcement comes at a somewhat precarious time, for a few reasons. For one, the US is currently locked in a trade war with China, and at the same time is accusing one of its biggest private companies (Huawei) of being able to spy on behalf of the Chinese government.That combination of forces has raised the hackles so high that the US government is looking elsewhere for Chinese companies that might pose a national security risk. Just last month, the Department of Homeland Security raised an alert about Chinese-made drones potentially being able to capture and transmit sensitive data back to the Chinese government. With DJI accounting for nearly 80 percent of drones in North America, it was viewed as a shot across the dronemaker's bow.The RoboMaster S1 is obviously far more limited in where it can travel, but it does have a high-resolution camera onboard. That could raise other concerns, as consumers (and even some in government) have become more sensitive about allowing cameras in the home.DJI is also presenting the S1 in somewhat militaristic language, which not only might grate with some consumers given the current tension between the US and China, but also because last week marked the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, where a man famously stood in front of (and stopped) Chinese military tanks.Tags:  See Campaign:            https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661741/dji-robomasters-toy-tank-drone-price-specsContact Information:Sean O'KaneTags:,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: June 12, 2019End of Document

A massive, ongoing hack has been compromising cell service providers around the world without them even knowing, a new report saysBusiness Insider USJune 25, 2019 Tuesday 02:57 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 586 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Antonio Villas-Boas)Highlight: The attack likely targeted high-profile individuals like government and military officials, revealing sensitive details of their activities.BodyAnucha Cheechang/Shutterstock.com• More than 10 cell service providers around the world have been hacked in an attack that compromises key information about customers of the affected providers, according to a report by security research firm Cybereason.• Information includes call detail records, like who customers were talking to, what devices they were using, and customer locations.• It's estimated that between 20 and 100 individuals are being targeted in the attack, which is likely aimed at high-profile individuals in government and military positions.  • The affected cell service providers are based in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. There's no indication yet that US cell service providers have been compromised. • Cybereason suspects the attack originates from China and it also suspects state-sponsorship, which suggests the Chinese government might be behind the attack. • Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Since 2012, hackers have had access to customer call detail records - like their locations, who they were talking to, and what devices they were using - from more than 10 cell service providers around the world, according to a report from security research firm Cybereason, which we saw on            TechCrunch and            CNET.Cybereason said with a "high level of certainty" that the hack was conducted from China, and is likely state-sponsored. The attacks are ongoing.The attacks targeted cell service providers from various countries, including countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Cybereason's investigation is still ongoing, so it can't reveal which cell service providers and companies have been affected, but the location of some of the victimized companies appear strategic.While the hack afforded the attackers access to any customer of the affected cell service provides, the number of targeted individuals ranges between 20 and 100, according to figures from TechCrunch and CNET. The attack was likely targeting high-profile individuals in government and military positions, one of the Cybereason report's authors, Mor Levi, said.Content from phone calls and messages weren't obtained, but the type of information that was gathered is still invaluable to any entity that intends to spy. There's no indication so far that US cell service providers were affected by the attack, one of the Cybereason report's authors, Amit Serper, said. Cybereason's suspicion of a China-sponsored cyber attack comes amid tensions between the US and China. The investigation is especially relevant to the US ban of Chinese telecoms company, Huawei, from doing business with US companies. The ban is based on US concerns that Huawei has ties with the Chinese government, and its products could, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, "potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests."NOW WATCH: The US won't let Huawei, China's biggest smartphone maker, enter the US marketSee Also:• There's a wildly popular conspiracy theory that Facebook listens to your private phone calls, and no matter what the tech giant says people just aren't convinced it's not true• A Florida city paid a $600,000 bitcoin ransom to hackers who took over its computers - and it's a massive alarm bell for the rest of the US• Google was grilled about China and other hot-button topics during its investor meetingSEE ALSO: Everything you need to know about Huawei, the Chinese tech giant accused of spying that the US just banned from doing business in AmericaLoad-Date: June 25, 2019End of Document

CHINA LAUNCHES NEW DRIVE AGAINST DALAI LAMA PHOTOS IN KARDZEStates News ServiceMay 29, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 457 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in Tibetan-populated regions of western Chinese provinces have launched a new push against possession of photos of exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, traveling to remote areas that had previously escaped police attention, Tibetan sources say.The campaign, which began at the end of April, has targeted Serthar county in Sichuan's Kardze (in Chinese, Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, but is also being enforced in other areas of the eastern Tibetan region historically known as Kham, a Tibetan living in Switzerland said."Chinese officials have banned the display of Dalai Lama photos in every family home of my native place in Serthar," former political prisoner Golog Jigme said, citing sources in the county."If the Chinese authorities discover the banned photos in any family home, not only will that family be fined, but the land of the village heads will be confiscated," Jigme said, adding that one Tibetan living in Serthar was recently fined for posting a photo of the Dalai Lama on the popular social media platform WeChat.The cell phone photo was taken of a portrait of the Dalai Lama kept on the family's shrine, Jigme said.Though possession and display of photos of the Dalai Lama, widely reviled by Chinese leaders as a "separatist," have long been restricted in the Tibet Autonomous Region and in western Chinese provinces, officials are now traveling even to hard-to-reach nomadic areas to enforce the ban, Jigme said."Given the difficulty of reaching certain remote areas where there are no motorable roads, Chinese officials have had little influence until now, and the Tibetans have been left to themselves to worship and practice [their religion] as they like.""However, beginning at the end of April this year, no parts of Serthar, even nomadic areas with inaccessible roads and little development, have been spared by the Chinese drive to ban the photos of the Dalai Lama," Jigme said.Chinese officials from government bureaus monitoring religious practice are also visiting Tibetan schools and warning teachers and students not to keep or display the photos, Jigme said, adding that local Tibetans have also been urged to tell high-ranking Chinese visitors of the "big improvements in their living conditions" owing to government subsidies.The Dalai Lama, who turned 83 on July 6, 2018, , fled Tibet into exile in India in the midst of a failed 1959 national uprising against Chinese rule, and displays by Tibetans of the Dalai Lama's photo or public celebrations of his birthday have been harshly punished in the past.Reported by Sonam Lhamo for RFA's Tibetan Service.

Countertops and rubber bands: US pursues obscure trade casesAssociated Press State & LocalMay 16, 2019 Thursday 8:35 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1129 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, AP Economics WriterDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump's high-profile trade offensives have grabbed headlines and rattled financial markets around the world. He's battling China over the industries of the future, strong-arming Canada and Mexico into reshaping North American trade and threatening to tax cars from Europe.But his trade warriors are fighting dozens of more obscure battles - over laminated woven sacks from Vietnam, dried tart cherries from Turkey, rubber bands from Thailand and many others.Under the radar, the Trump administration has launched 162 investigations into allegations that U.S. trading partners dump products at cut-rate prices or unfairly subsidize their exporters - a 224% jump from the number of cases the Obama administration pursued in the same time in office.If the U.S Commerce Department finds that U.S. companies have been hurt - and ultimately if the independent International Trade Commission goes along - the offending imports are slapped with duties that can price them out of the market.On Thursday, for instance, the department announced levies of up to 337% in combat over kitchen and bathroom countertops - or at least over the imported quartz slabs from China that many of them derive from.These cases have nothing directly to do with the mother of all Trump's trade wars: a cage match with China over Beijing's aggressive push to transform Chinese companies into world leaders in cutting-edge industries like artificial intelligence and electric cars. In that one, the world's two biggest economies have slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of each other's products.The smaller antidumping and "countervailing duty" (aimed at unfair subsidies) cases are usually brought by U.S. companies or industries that say they're being victimized by foreign competitors. But for the first time in more than 25 years, the administration in 2017 brought a case on its own - against a common alloy aluminum sheet from China - without waiting for an industry's plea for help."They're much more aggressive in every way," said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says that the administration's trade policies have "irrevocably changed the conversation on trade" and that the dumping and subsidy cases "help level the playing field for U.S. companies and workers."Like any conflict, though, the battles over remote patches of the commercial marketplace leave winners and losers. Lovely says the Trump administration's intervention in trade cases risks "tilting the playing field toward particular industries," driving up prices and making the economy less efficient by driving away competition.Whatever the impact, the administration's America First approach to trade is encouraging more companies to bring more cases."Everybody knows that this administration is concerned about unfair trade and is very willing to offset unfair trade where that is warranted.," said Gilbert Kaplan, the Commerce Department's under secretary for international trade.The dollar amounts in antidumping and countervailing duty cases are too small to make a real dent in the $21 trillion U.S. economy.But for the companies involved, the stakes often couldn't be higher.America's struggling newspapers, for instance, saw their costs spike when the Commerce Department last year imposed antidumping and countervailing duties on Canadian newsprint. Some newspaper companies planned layoffs as a result. But in August, the trade commission, which acts as an independent tribunal in trade cases, overturned the duties, sparing newspapers devastating cost increases.The newsprint case was brought by a single company: a hedge fund-owned paper producer in Washington state.Likewise, the offensive against imported quartz slabs from China originated from a single complaint: Cambria, a maker of quartz products, including high-end kitchen and bathroom countertops, based in Le Sueur, Minnesota.Cambria CEO Martin Davis says the U.S. marketplace was flooded by low-priced quartz slabs from China. Commerce Department figures show that imports from China surged 78% in 2016 and 54% in 2017. The influx, Davis said, was subsidized by the Chinese government."My company was going down," he said.Davis sought relief from the government. He said that pursuing the case has cost him $5 million. Commerce agreed to impose antidumping and countervailing duties on Chinese quartz slabs last year.On Thursday, the department announced its final decision on the duties, hitting Chinese quartz slabs with antidumping duties of up to 337% and with countervailing duties of up to 191%.The levies are bad news for U.S. companies that make countertops from imported quartz. Jeff Keck of Marble Uniques in Tipton, Indiana, says the higher duties struck while his company was working on a contract to provide quartz countertops to an apartment complex."We will lose money on the project," he said.Making things worse from his perspective: The duties are retroactive to August.Paul Nathanson, spokesman for the American Quartz Worker Coalition set up to fight the duties, said that Cambria is abusing trade law."They are using the U.S. government to try to wipe out their competitors," he said.The ITC held a hearing last week at which opponents of the duties argued that high-end Cambria doesn't actually compete with inexpensive Chinese imports. The commission is expected to rule on the case next month. If it finds that Cambria wasn't hurt by the imports, the ITC could strike down the duties.For now, the sanctions on quartz imports are helping some businesses, and not just Cambria. Among them is Blackbird Manufacturing, an Owensboro, Kentucky, company that makes stone countertops. CEO David Thomas said that Blackbird couldn't compete with low-priced Chinese quartz for contracts with penny-pinching hotel chains.Now that Chinese quartz slabs are now being taxed out of the market, "we're getting jobs landing twice a week, and they're big jobs," Thomas said. Blackbird has hired about 15 workers since June and now has a staff of 52. He plans to add 20 more this year.But as the administration mounts trade cases in dozens of industries, many companies, especially small ones, can be blindsided by duties they didn't see coming, said Paula Connelly, a trade lawyer in Woburn, Massachusetts."I've been in this business a long time, and I've never seen this volume of investigation," she said.Recently, she has fielded calls from importers who were hit unexpectedly by the big tariffs on quartz. One business owner said he might have to close shop."They had two days to come up with a couple of hundred thousand dollars in antidumping and countervailing duties," she said.___Follow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/PaulWisemanAPLoad-Date: May 17, 2019End of Document

Google Slumps as Network Issues, DoJ Probe Report, China List Pressure SharesTheStreet.comJune 3, 2019 Monday 5:02 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 528 wordsByline: Martin BaccardaxHighlight: Alphabet shares were indicated sharply lower Monday as investor trimmed holdings of the Google parent following a weekend issue that caused traffic congestion across key parts of its network and a report that suggested it may face a federal antitrust probe over its search engine.BodyAlphabet Inc.  shares were indicated sharply lower Monday as investor trimmed holdings of the Google parent following a weekend issue that caused traffic congestion across key parts of its network and a report that suggested it may face a federal antitrust probe over its search engine.Google said the network issue, which began around mid-afternoon on Sunday, affected both its Cloud and YouTube offerings and caused severe congestion and user outages in the northeastern United States. "The network congestion issue in eastern USA, affecting Google Cloud, G Suite, and YouTube has been resolved for all affected users as of 4:00 pm US/Pacific," Alphabet said in a statement. "We will conduct an internal investigation of this issue and make appropriate improvements to our systems to help prevent or minimize future recurrence.""We will provide a detailed report of this incident once we have completed our internal investigation," the statement added. "This detailed report will contain information regarding SLA credits."Google shares were marked 3.2% lower in pre-market trading Monday, indicating an opening bell price of $1,071.11 each, a move that would trim its year-to-date gain to just 2.5%.Google's larger market issue Monday, however, centers around multiple media reports from late Friday -- first by the Wall Street Journal --- that suggested the U.S. Department of Justice is preparing a far-reaching probe into the tech giant's sprawling business.Last year, Google was fined a record $5 billion by European antitrust authorities following a lengthy investigation into contracts that tie makers of android-operated smartphones to the exclusive sale of its apps and was hit with a further $1.7 billion penalty in March for unfairly restricting rivals from displaying ads on its platform via third parties using its AdSense tool."Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites," Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. "This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. The misconduct lasted over 10 years and denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate - and consumers the benefits of competition."Should Google find itself in the crosshairs of a similar Justice Department probe in the United States, the Mountain View, California-based group could be susceptible to fines and restrictions in its biggest and most import market. It could also, given the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, appear on the forthcoming list of "Unreliable Entities" being prepared by the Chinese government in an effort to respond to the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei Technologies last month."Foreign enterprises, organizations and individuals that do not comply with market rules, violate the spirit of contract, block or cut supplies to Chinese firms with non-commercial purposes, and seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, will be added to the list of unreliable entities," Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Friday.Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Why Investors Must Watch Tariff SignalsUSNEWS.comJune 7, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; The Smarter Investor; Vol.; No.Length: 1220 wordsByline: Dan KernHighlight: The long-term impact of a more protectionist world features more negatives for investors than positives.BodyThe deterioration of trade talks between the United States and China surprised investors and raised the odds of a recession. Although trade represents a relatively small percentage of U.S. and Chinese GDP, the direct and indirect impact resulting from a protracted trade war is a potential game-changer for equity markets. Trade wars aren't easy to win -- and no one really "wins" a trade war. China exports more to the U.S. than it imports from the U.S., consequently American tariffs on China goods will weigh on Chinese growth. In addition, sanctions against Huawei will deprive China of access to vital technology critical to China's long-term aspirations. China is likely to offset some of the economic pain through economic stimulus or currency depreciation. Although the U.S. seemingly has the upper hand in trade negotiations, the U.S. economy and stock market are vulnerable to Chinese retaliatory actions. [See:Stop Believing These 7 Investing Myths.]In recent years, China has made it a priority to diversify food import sources. Until 2014 American corn supplied more than 90% of the China import market. Imports of Ukrainian corn surged in recent years and now account for about 70% of Chinese annual corn imports. As trade tensions heated up last year, China sought alternative sources for its massive demand for soybeans. American farmers suffered when soybean prices fell dramatically after China turned to Brazil to replace the U.S. as its primary supplier. Soybean prices tumbled again after the latest escalation of tensions between the U.S. and China. The pain of a trade war will not be confined to the agriculture sector. Stock markets provide an important channel through which economic developments in China have an "outsized" impact on the rest of the world. S&P 500 and other leading global companies derive a large share of their revenues in China, often through their overseas operations or through joint ventures with Chinese companies. The global auto sector is a clear example of this theme. China accounts for up to 40% of revenue for some European auto manufacturers, notably VW and other German brands. General Motors is among the American automakers with substantial sales in China, and many luxury goods providers consider China the "make or break" market that determines whether earnings beat or fall short of expectations. American semiconductor and technology hardware companies get a substantial amount of sales from China, placing their growth at risk if trade tensions persist. China's desire for self-reliance in key technology products may intensify, prompting the Chinese government to provide even more support to domestic players in industries such as artifi­cial intelligence, robotics, driverless vehicles and military hardware. U.S. firms that have been stock market favorites in recent years may suffer from lost sales to China and increased competition in other markets from Chinese "national champions." Disruption of specialized supply chains would be an indirect impact magnifying the cost of trade war. The view of the world that thinks that most trade is in finished goods that are shipped from country to country is a relic of a bygone era. Today, much of trade activity is in components that travel across national borders to supply diverse production networks. Global supply chains form a complex web in which value is added during journeys that cross multiple borders. The iPhone is designed in the U.S. but made in China with components and assembly also from Korea, Taiwan and Japan. Auto manufacturing is also notable for supply chain complexity. A Japanese auto manufacturer may make engines in Japan, ship them to Canada where the cars undergo further assembly, then send the cars to be finished in Mexico. [See:6 Great Tips to Build an Income-Producing Portfolio.]Companies forced to reconfigure supply chains risk having stranded assets that will weigh on financial results and stock prices. Trade tensions create the type of uncertainty that business executives dread, so it shouldn't be surprising that business spending is falling short of expectations. If trade remains the focal point of a great power rivalry between the U.S. and China, a less globalized world may shift to regional trading blocs. The rise of regional trading relationships may create interesting long-term investment opportunities, however, the transition costs of de-globalization would be a negative near-term shock to markets and economic growth. The long-term impact of a more protectionist world features more negatives than positives. In a recent speech, Mohamed El-Erian asked an important question: "Are tariffs the destination or part of the journey?" If tariffs are the destination, economic growth and equity markets are likely to suffer. In contrast, if tariffs are part of a journey that ultimately leads to lower tariffs, greater market access and stronger intellectual property protections, economic growth and equity markets could rebound sharply. Until recently, investors expected the economy -- particularly employment -- to be a binding constraint for President Donald Trump. The consensus was that Trump would not risk an economic downturn heading into the 2020 election and would be motivated to negotiate a trade deal or a temporary de-escalation of tensions. The risk to this investor-friendly thesis is that Trump thinks that animosity toward China is more important to mobilizing the GOP voter base than economic growth and employment. If in Trump's eyes animosity toward China carries more electoral weight than economic growth, then tariffs become the destination rather than part of the journey. Chinese President Xi Jinping has his own set of constraints. Nationalist sentiment is high in China, given resistance to a repeat of the terms imposed by foreign powers for more than a century of China's history. A risk, according to TS Lombard's Christopher Granville, is that "Beijing may conclude that nothing will satisfy the U.S. ... so that when Mr. Trump judges the moment ripe to 'turn on a dime' and reach agreement with China, he may find the negotiating room empty." Investors should look for clues from China and the U.S. to determine whether tariffs are part of the journey or are the ultimate destination. Economic signals are important -- the more that China stimulates its economy, the higher the likelihood that Xi is preparing for a long battle over trade. In the U.S., rising unemployment or further deterioration in manufacturing growth should motivate Trump to negotiate a cease fire. Rhetoric also matters and a de-escalation of the nationalist rhetoric from both sides would be a positive signal for markets. [See:10 Ways to Maximize Your Retirement Investments.]Disclosures: Registration with the SEC should not be construed as an endorsement or an indicator of investment skill, acumen or experience.

China Stock Market Likely To Open Under PressureCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 4, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 467 wordsBody       The China stock market has finished lower in three straight sessions, sinking almost 25 points or 0.8 percent along the way. The Shanghai Composite Index now rests just above the 2,890-point plateau and it may extend its losses again on Tuesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is mixed to lower, with technology and oil stocks expected to fall under considerable pressure. The European markets were up and the U.S. bourses were mostly down and the Asian markets are tipped to follow the latter lead. The SCI finished modestly lower on Monday following mixed performances from the oil companies and property stocks, while the financials offered support. For the day, the index fell 8.62 points or 0.30 percent to finish at 2,890.08 after trading between 2,875.90 and 2,920.83. The Shenzhen Composite Index skidded 15.97 points or 1.04 percent to end at 1,515.89. Among the actives, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China jumped 1.60 percent, while China Construction Bank collected 0.43 percent, China Merchants Bank advanced 0.56 percent, China Life Insurance added 0.34 percent, Ping An Insurance rose 0.32 percent, PetroChina shed 0.28 percent, China Petroleum and Chemical (Sinopec) was up 0.18 percent, China Shenhua Energy gathered 0.92 percent, Gemdale lost 0.69 percent, Poly Development was up 0.16 percent, China Vanke sank 0.97 percent, CITIC Securities gained 0.30 percent and Bank of China was unchanged. The lead from Wall Street is ominous thanks to a steep drop from the tech-heavy NASDAQ - while the Dow and the S&P were mixed and little changed. The Dow added 4.74 points or 0.02 percent to 24,819.78, while the NASDAQ plummeted 120.13 points or 1.61 percent to 7,333.02 and the S&P 500 fell 7.61 points or 0.28 percent to 2,744.45. The steep drop by the NASDAQ came as tech stocks came under pressure following reports of antitrust investigations involving several big-name companies like Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). Trade concerns also continued to weigh on the markets after an official document from the Chinese government blamed the U.S. for the escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. The escalating global trade tensions led St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard to suggest a reduction in interest rates "may be warranted soon." In U.S. economic news, the Institute for Supply Management said the pace of growth in manufacturing activity unexpectedly saw a continued slowdown in May. Crude oil futures ended lower Monday, extending losses to a fourth straight session amid continued worries about energy demand due to fears of global economic slowdown. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures for July ended down $0.25 or 0.5 percent at $53.25 a barrel.        Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Honeywell and Air China to Share Aviation Knowledge With Youth in Guangxi AreaTargeted News ServiceJune 18, 2019 Tuesday 1:18 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 614 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SHANGHAI, China BodyHoneywell Aerospace, a division of Honeywell International, issued the following news release:* * *- The Joint Youth Exhibition Hall Aims to Promote Education, Cultivate Innovative Spirit* * *For a decade, Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has been actively participating in poverty-alleviation efforts and fulfilling its corporate social responsibility in China through its Hometown Solutions Program. As Honeywell embarks on the second decade of its poverty-alleviation work in China, the company is partnering with China National Aviation Holding Company ("Air China") to build the first joint youth aviation exhibition hall in Zhaoping County in Guangxi Province. The goal is to expose and encourage children in remote mountainous regions to explore science, engineering, technology and math education.The joint youth aviation exhibition hall consists of two sections - "Scientific Knowledge" and "Humanity Knowledge," with the aim of propagating scientific technology and cultivating the youngsters' innovative spirit. As part of this project, Honeywell will tap into Air China's existing talent-training and exchange projects to help train teachers who will have a positive impact in their communities both locally and globally."As a state-owned enterprise, Air China is steadfast in our efforts to make full use of corporate resources combined with the cultural characteristics of our designated poverty-alleviation regions," said Cao Jianxiong, Air China Deputy Secretary of Party Committee. "It's our honor to provide improvements in basic living conditions and promote education for youth in the poor mountainous regions. We are pleased to further strengthen our cooperation with Honeywell to fulfill our corporate social responsibility in poverty-alleviation work in Guangxi Prefecture."Since undertaking poverty-alleviation work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Guangxi Autonomous Region in 2013, Air China has been meticulously helping improve living condition for people in Zhaoping County in Guangxi Autonomous Region. With Honeywell's contributions, the exhibition hall will allow youth in this region to benefit from increased educational opportunities and connections to the world through science and technology."The aviation industry is a pearl in the industrial arena and holds the key to grooming science, technology, engineering and math education," said Steven Lien, President, Honeywell Aerospace, Asia Pacific. "The door to the outside world for youth in regions like Zhaoping County remains closed due to limited educational resources and lack of accessibility to these remote areas. We hope that through the establishment of an Aviation Exhibition Hall, students will have an opportunity to understand the aviation industry, develop a passion for learning and a cultivate the desire to explore."Implemented in 2009, Honeywell Hometown Solutions has embraced the mission of providing opportunities to those living below the poverty line and inspiring students around the world to pursue their dreams. During the past 10 years Honeywell Aerospace has responded to a rallying call for poverty-alleviation efforts from the Chinese government and worked with several major partners including AVIC, COMAC, Tibet Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Erdos Airport Group and Sichuan Airlines. Honeywell Hometown Solutions has traveled to numerous places such as Ningxia's Xiji, Lhasa of Tibet, Yunnan's Shuangjiang, Inner Mongolia's Erdos and Sichuan's Liangshan, donating nearly 31,000 books, more than 150 computers and other multimedia learning facilities to 17 schools, benefiting over 23,700 students to-date.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6764547 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 23, 2019End of Document

Continue reading Google pulls Huawei's Android license, forcing it to use open source versionFollowing the US crackdown on Chinese technology companies, Google has cut off Huawei's Android license, dealing a huge blow to the besieged phonemaker. Reuters first reported the news, and The Verge subsequently confirmed Google's suspension of business with Huawei with a source familiar with the matter.Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson said only  We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications.  The order, in this case, appears to be the US Chamber of Commerce's recent decision to place Huawei on the  Entity List,  which as Reuters reports is a list of companies that are unable to buy technology from US companies without government approval.Huawei is now restricted to using the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), cutting the company off from critical Google apps and services that consumers outside of China expect on Android devices. That also means Huawei will only be able to push security updates for Android once they're made available in AOSP, assuming the company uses its own update system. It's not clear yet how this will affect the full range of Android integrations that Huawei depends on, but we will update this story when we receive additional clarification about the impacts of Google's decision.Huawei has been under increasing pressure from President Trump and the US government over fears that its equipment could be used by the Chinese government to spy on American networks. These fears have been under construction for a long time; In 2018, US intelligence agencies warned againstusing Huawei and ZTE devices, and US politicians have described Huawei as  effectively an arm of the Chinese government. Huawei maintains that it is not possible for the Chinese government to poison its equipment with backdoors, and it has remained optimistic about the future of its business. But this latest setback from Google poses a grave risk to the future of Huawei's core mobile business. The company was already preparing its own operating systems in the event of being banned from using Android and Windows, but given US fears about foreign interference, a home-grown OS is likely to face even more scrutiny than Google's software.Update, 5/19/19, 5:18 PM: This story has been updated with confirmation of the Reuters story, plus some additional detail about Google's suspension of business with Huawei.Tags:  See Campaign:            https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspensionContact Information:T.C.

(NASDAQ: AAPL), according to Wedbush.The AnalystDaniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating on            Apple with an unchanged $235 price target.The ThesisA trade resolution at the upcoming G-20 summit between the U.S. and Chinese governments could translate to Apple's stock moving higher by $20 to $25 per share in the coming months, Ives said in a Thursday note. (See his track record here.)A resolution would remove a "dark cloud" hovering over Apple's stock, which currently reflects a long-term risk to Apple's numbers and the potential for growing nationalism in China that boosts demand for local smartphones at the expense of the iPhone, the analyst said. The trade dispute and corresponding supply chain tariff disruptions could impact Apple's earnings power by 10% to 15% over the coming years, Ives said, adding that Apple has become the "poster child" for the trade dispute, right or wrong.The Street's sentiment may be more negative than how the trade tensions will ultimately play out, implying a "compelling" risk-reward profile for Apple, the analyst said.Apple appears to be the "most safe" company among the FAANG group in terms of antitrust sentiment and potential regulatory changes at the government level, according to Wedbush. Price ActionApple shares were down 0.73% at $192.74 at the close Friday. Related Links:Legal Expert Breaks Down Antitrust Risk For Big US Tech StocksAnalysts: China Isn't Targeting Apple In Trade WarPhoto by Daniel Lu/Wikimedia. Latest Ratings for AAPLDateFirmActionFromToJun 2019Initiates Coverage OnOutperformJun 2019MaintainsBuyMay 2019MaintainsOverweightView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL           View the Latest Analyst Ratings© 2019 Benzinga.com.

PRESS CONFERENCE BY FOREIGN MINISTER TARO KONO TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 2019, 2:40 P.M.States News ServiceJune 4, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1177 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: TOKYO, Japan BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan:Opening RemarksASEAN- JAPAN Day in Hanoi, Viet NamMr. Taro Kono, Minister for Foreign Affairs: Today, ASEAN-JAPAN Day is being held in Hanoi, Viet Nam. At the symposium being held today, broad discussions will be held regarding cooperation in political, economic, and social fields, which cooperation is expected in the coming days including high-tech agriculture, smart cities, and aging society.In July, as part of cultural exchange, a music event is also planned to be held with participation by artists from both ASEAN member states and Japan. For example, I have heard that ATSUSHI from EXILE is planned to participate from Japan. It is expected that there will be further strengthening of mutual understanding and cooperative partnership between Japan and ASEAN through such opportunities.30 Years Since the Tiananmen Square IncidentNHK, Okuzumi: Today, it is exactly 30 years since the Tiananmen Square Incident. There has still been no change to the Chinese Government's position that suppression through the military was justified. Can you please give your thoughts on the 30 years since the incident, as well as your views on the current situation where criticisms towards the Chinese Government are thoroughly suppressed through Internet regulations and the control of speech?Minister Kono: I believe that values such as freedom, fundamental human rights, and the rule of law should be shared globally. I believe that is probably the same in China, and that it is considered that freedom, fundamental human rights, and the rule of law should be ensured in China as well. As Japan, although not yet restarted with China, there are frameworks such as the Japan-China Human Rights Dialogues, so we would like to have dialogues about such issues in various settings.Kyodo News, Eto: What is your reaction to the current human rights situation in China?Minister Kono: Concerns regarding human rights in China have been conveyed to them at Foreign Ministers' Meetings and Summit Meetings. Although our political systems are different, I believe that fundamental human rights, the rule of law, and freedom are international and universal values which can be shared with China.Yomiuri Shimbun, Yanada: Relations are currently improving between Japan and China, but for example, it has been pointed out that confrontations concerning values have been growing considerably between China and the United States as well as European countries. What role do you think Japan can play in inducing China to engage with the international community? Also, it has been 9 or 10 years, since the Japan-China Human Rights Dialogue you mentioned has been suspended. What do you think should be done for it to be resumed, or should it be resumed? I would like to ask your thoughts on this.Minister Kono: Regarding the Japan-China Human Rights Dialogue, Japan is proposing to China that it should be resumed. I think that Western values and Asian values are the same at the most fundamental level, but it seems to me that there are also various differences. For example, although the Chinese political system is a little different thus that should be taken into account, I think it is important for Japan to somewhat emphasize the Asian ways of thinking. On the issue of democratization in Asia, for example, Western countries and Japan have been discussing from slightly different positions at the G7 Foreign Minister's Meeting and other opportunities. Of course, China and Japan share considerable cultural aspects, but I would like to continue discussions between Japan and China in terms of universal values which can be shared between the two despite different political systems.Japan-North Korea RelationsAsahi Shimbun, Kiyomiya: I would like to ask about North Korea. The North Korean media have criticized you by name, and have said it is impudent to hold a Summit Meeting without conditions. What is your reaction to this? Also, the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue, an international conference, will be held this week, so if North Korea comes, what will be communicated if contact will be made?Minister Kono: I do not have comments on individual North Korean reports, but Prime Minister Abe has stated that action will be taken to seize all opportunities to resolve the abductions issue as quickly as possible amidst the aging of the abduction victims' families. Prime Minister Abe has repeatedly stated until now that he is prepared to meet directly with Chairman Kim Jong-un.As stated in the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration, there is absolutely no change to Japan's policy to comprehensively resolve the nuclear, missile, and abductions issues and normalize relations, so we will act in accordance with that policy. There is no change to the fact that we will follow the policy if there is contact in Ulaanbaatar or wherever.Situation in IranMainichi Shimbun, Akiyama: I would like to ask about the situation in Iran. You have indicated recently that both Iran and the United States should exhibit self-control, so what points has Japan been urging during recent contacts with the United States? Also, last year Secretary of State Pompeo clarified 12 demands for Iran as part of the U.S. basic policy, so how do you assess this?Minister Kono: Japan will firmly contribute to the regional stability as much as we can, and I believe it is certainly true that regional stabilization through dialogue is necessary. There is currently not much to be commented externally regarding various exchanges, but if there is a role Japan should play, then we will firmly fulfill it.30 Years Since the Tiananmen Square IncidentKyodo News, Saito: I would like to return to the matter of Tiananmen Square in China again. You previously stated that there are differences between the West and Asia regarding the ideal concept of democratization. You mentioned the Asian concept, and I would like to ask about that. Can you give your thoughts on the Asian concept of democratization and human rights which are different from the West in simple terms?Minister Kono: It has been many years since the West established its current concepts of freedom, democratization, and fundamental human rights. Many Asian countries began new political systems after they were liberated from colonization, so it has still been a short time compared to the West.As I stated previously somewhere, the Roman Empire withdrew from the United Kingdom approximately in the year 400, and then the United Kingdom formed its current political system over hundreds of years. It has still not even been 100 years since the United Kingdom withdrew from Myanmar, so it is quite difficult to do something similar immediately with such a difference in the time period. It is important to steadily proceed one step at a time, as it would be impossible for a crawling baby to run like Usain Bolt. However, sooner or later, it will stand and take toddling steps, so it is important to stand by and lend a helping hand if necessary so it does not fall.Load-Date: June 10, 2019End of Document

Trump, presidents of China and the United States, respectively, will hold a meeting to discuss trade, China has already made public its position, that it will make no concessions, unless the United States is also willing to do so."We must find ourselves halfway, which means that both sides will have to commit and make concessions, not just a part," Wang Shouwen, China's deputy trade minister, and one of that country's top negotiators, said at a press conference.If Washington intends to end the year-long trade war between the world's two largest economies and has shaken the performance of global growth, it must commit to its counterpart for negotiation to take place on a Equitable.Wang said China would negotiate with respect for the sovereignty of both countries and the rules of the World Trade Organization.For his part, Xi Jinping showed his restraint, saying that while China and the United States have had trade differences, which has caused negative impacts on the industries of both nations, "They have precedents for solving difficult problems on economy and trade through dialogue. Economic teams on both sides must increase their communication and coordination on issues concerning them, so that they have an acceptable agenda for both sides," Jinping said according to the Chinese government's television network CCTV.Although some in China see that the situation between Beijing and Washington has only worsened, warning about the possibility of a failed meeting, Donald Trump seems to give a more optimistic outlook."I had a very good phone conversation with President Xi of China. We'll have a meeting next week at the G20 in Japan. Our respective teams will begin conversations before our meeting," the US representative wrote on his Twitter account last week.Load-Date: June 26, 2019End of Document

The government has also launched several programs and in-centives to encourage R&D development and innovation, such as offering robot manufac-turers and automation businesses subsidies, low-interest loans, tax relief, and land rental incentives. As of March 2017, more than 800 companies were directly involved in industrial robot manufacturing in the country. SIASUN and DJI are the major Chinese robotics players. Also, the foreign players like FANUC and Nachi-Fujikoshi have franchised with KUKA, ABB, Reis Robotics, and Staubli to establish production facilities in the country. The Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn is another major robotics player in China.The primary application of Industrial robots in the country is in sectors like automobile manufacturing, electrical and electronics, rubber plastics, metallurgy, food, chemical engi-neering, and medicine and cosmetics. About half of the industrial robots are used in the Au-tomobile sector, of which more than 50% are welding robots.Title: Global Radiopharmaceuticals Market Share, By Region, 2017North America 14%South America 1%Europe 19%Asia Pacific 66%ROW 4%Get Detailed Report at https://www.wiseguyreports.com/reports/3791546-global-industrial-robots-market-2018-2025Key PlayersThe Global Industrial Robots market report profiles the following companies-Mitsubishi Electric, ABB Robotics, Omron Adept Technologies, Fanuc Robotics, Yaskawa Mo-toman, KUKA Robotics, Epson Robots, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Staubli, Nachi-Fujikoshi, Denso Corporation.Why purchase the report?• Visualize the composition of the Industrial Robots market across each indication, in terms of application highlighting the key commercial assets and players.• Identify commercial opportunities in Industrial Robots market by analyzing trends and co-development deals.• Excel data sheet with thousands of data points of the Industrial Robots market level 4/5 segmentation• PDF report with the most relevant analysis cogently put together after exhaustive qualitative interviews and in-depth market study• Product mapping in excel for the key Industrial Robots market products of all major market playersTarget Audience• Raw Material Suppliers/ Buyers• Product Suppliers/ Buyers• Industry Investors/Investment Bankers• Education & Research Institutes• Research Professionals• Emerging Companies• ManufacturersTable of Contents• Global Industrial Robots Market   Methodology and Scope • Global Industrial Robots Market   Trends • Global Industrial Robots Market   Industry Analysis • Global Industrial Robots Market   By Type • Global Industrial Robots Market   By Payload • Global Industrial Robots Market   By Application • Global Industrial Robots Market   By End-user Industry • Global Industrial Robots Market   By Geography • Global Industrial Robots Market   Competitive Landscape • Global Industrial Robots Market   Company Profiles* About Us:Wise Guy Reports is part of the Wise Guy Research Consultants Pvt.

They denounce that China uses facial recognition systems to persecute a Muslim minorityCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 15, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 429 wordsBody China uses an extended secret system of facial recognition technology to monitor and control the Uighur Muslim minority, in what is the first known case of the use of artificial intelligence to develop racial profiles by a government, revealed an investigation by The New York Times  With this technology, the Asian giant expands its surveillance network of this minority from the Xinjiang region - home to almost 11 million Uyghurs - to other parts of the country, the US newspaper reported in an article published on Sunday.  The facial recognition platform is integrated into the surveillance camera networks and searches exclusively the Uighurs according to their appearance, and keeps track of their movements for searching and reviewing.  The research, supported by the testimony of five experts with direct knowledge of the systems (quoted in anonymity), in police databases, public procurement documents and material from the companies that manufacture the systems, places China as a pioneer in the that could lead to "a new era of automated racism," the morning paper said.  CloudWalk, one of the companies that provide this technology, describes a possible use experience in its website:  "If originally a Uyghur lives in a neighborhood, and six Uyghurs appear in 20 days, it sends alarms immediately" to the police.  The article states that with this technology, Beijing is now pursuing the Uyghurs in rich eastern cities, such as Hangzhou and Wenzhou, and in the coastal province of Fujian.  According to recruitment documents, more than 20 police departments in 16 different provinces and regions searched for this technology as of 2018.  An example of this is the central province of Shaanxi, which last year tendered the purchase of a smart camera system that "should support facial recognition to identify the Uighur / non-Uighur attributes."  Uyghurs look different from the majority population and are more like the inhabitants of Central Asia, which makes them relatively easy to distinguish by software.  From the technological point of view, recalls the newspaper, the use of algorithms to label people according to their race or ethnicity has become relatively easy, although in practice the systems are imperfect and their accuracy depends on environmental factors, such as lighting and the positioning of the cameras.  The Chinese government has received widespread international condemnation for its severe crackdown on ethnic Muslims in its western region, including the detention of up to one million of them in detention camps.  Advertising       Load-Date: April 15, 2019End of Document

Interview with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence; President Donald Trump Threatens Tariffs on Mexico over Immigration Crisis; Measles Cases Reach Highest Number in 25 Years; Raptors Beat WarriorsMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 7:00 AM ESTMay 31, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 6999 wordsByline: Dagen McDowell, Cheryl Casone, Jared Max, Maria Bartiromo, Kat TimpfGuests: Mike Murphy, Stephen Moore, Jonas Max Ferris, Mike PenceBodyDAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday May 31st,Breaking news right here right now. Markets selling off as President Trump threatens tariffs on Mexico over immigration. This big league announcement -- well it shocked investors. The President planning to impose escalating tariffs starting at 5 percent on June 10th. Those tariffs could go up to 25 percent by October 1st, if Mexico doesn't do more to curb the flow of Central American immigrants -- illegal immigrants into the United States.Maria sat down for an exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence who talked about USMCA and when it could finally be passed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: President Trump has negotiated a deal in USMCA that really puts American jobs and American workers first. I'm going to carry that message to Capitol Hill and urge them to take this measure up this summer.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Vice President Pence also discussing China trade as a new round of tariffs on American goods set to go into effect tomorrow. The exclusive interview coming up.Trade fears hitting markets. Tet's take a look at futures this morning. A 275-point loss on the Dow futures. If you look at a chart last night of when this news broke about the imposition of tariffs on Mexican import in the U.S., markets took a nose dive.Trade-related stocks -- General Motors, Apple, Boeing, Nvidia. Apple more impacted by what's going on with China but certainly General Motors has a lot of cross-border activity between Mexico and the United States. That stock hammered this morning down almost 5 percent. Yesterday's markets managing the rebound.Let's take a look at Europe. European markets are down across the board in England, France and Germany off their lows of the morning certainly in England.In Asia overnight, markets mostly in the red there. South Korea showing a slight gain.Here to break it all down Fox News contributor "GREG GUTFELD SHOW" correspondent, "National Review" reporter -- she does it all -- Kat Timpf. Rosecliff CEO managing partner Mike Murphy. Along with MaxFunds.com co- founder Jonas Max Ferris.Mike -- what to make of this. Is the market -- is our economy and the market in a position where they can handle this. Again we've already before this announcement -- the yield curve, 10-year yields below the three-month yield. Inverted -- a sign that the Fed could be forced to cut rates, that maybe we are headed towards recession. And now this.MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSE CLIFF CAPITAL: Yes, so I think the short answer is, yes, the economy can handle this. the stock market, though, has had a pullback and you don't want to give it a reason to sell off more because a lot of times selling begets more selling. If people believe it's going lower, they're going to short -- there's going to be more pressure on it.But you hit an important point that I think now the odds of the Fed actually cutting rates to boost the economy is near certainty this year. So we're going to get a rate cut and hopefully that will help. And we know the President is watching the stock market very closely. So hopefully there's more thought into this where it won't really hurt the stock market.MCDOWELL: Jonas -- take a look at the 10-year. The 10-year treasury -- money flowing into it, the yield falling again this morning. What do you say?JONAS MAX FERRIS, MAXFUNDS.COM: You don't have tariffs on money coming in yet. So we're always going to be the top destination for money during any kind of economic slowdown.You know, I don't know what to make of all this at this point. The -- I mean President, you know, if he wants to do something about the border which is his campaign promise and he's a little hamstrung, the Democrats don't want to work with him. They don't think it's an issues. So he goes to tariffs because you can play a national security angle.From this video, I don't know. Pence sounds like (INAUDIBLE) thinks it's really a national security issue all these tariffs -- that that isn't just the path the President's taking to get what he wants. I don't understand why Democrats aren't more on its side.The USMCA in my opinion is what would happen if unions re-did NAFTA. It's actually pro-labor, it's not some to make General Motors profit go up -- that's why the stock's down.MCDOWELL: Well, I can tell you because the Democrats are not going to give this President one win on anything even if it does help everybody in the United States.And we continue to watch the market. We turn to Vice President Mike Pence. He sat down for an exclusive interview with Maria in Canada yesterday.Former special counsel Robert Mueller finally breaking his silence into the Russia investigation earlier this week.In part 2 of her interview she asked the Vice President about his take on Mueller, possibility of impeachment. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It is pretty extraordinary that the President is getting so much done given the fact that the Democrats are still talking about impeaching the President. what was your reaction to what Robert Mueller said this week?PENCE: Well, I was -- frankly I was pleased to see the special counsel announce that the investigation is over. case closed. The special counsel sent his report. And he concluded that there was no collusion and after review of the facts the Department of Justice confirmed there was no collusion, no obstruction.The American people -- the American people want to see this Congress move on. Move on to the things that are making a difference in their lives.BARTIROMO: He said, if we knew that the President did not commit a crime we would have said so. And that's stoking more impeachment talks. Are you expecting impeachment proceedings?PENCE: Well, I wouldn't know why there would be. I really wouldn't. I mean, this president has been delivering for the American people.These questions were raised about election interference. And we know that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. We don't believe it affected the outcome in any way but we've held them accountable for that. We've taken steps to ensure that that doesn't happen again.But there were other questions raised about collusion. Now even the special counsel confirmed that there was no collusion between our campaign and the Russians. And the Department of Justice has confirmed that there was no collusion, no obstruction.The matter is entirely over. It's entirely closed. The American people got the answers. And I couldn't be more proud, Maria, of the fact that for more than two years hundreds of witnesses, millions of pages of documents, full cooperation with the special counsel, this president and our office and our entire administration fully cooperated.And the American people now know that the investigation is at an end. They have their answers. But what I think the country wants to see us do is focus on the things that are now most important to them. And that is jobs and security.You know, we are in discussions right now about a budget agreement that would allow us to continue to make historic investments in our national defense. We've got a crisis on our southern border.You traveled there very recently, you saw it firsthand as did your viewers on this program. I mean we are on track to have more than a million apprehensions at southern border. And yet Congress, some in Congress continue to focus on investigations, baseless allegations while literally last month alone more than 118,000 people were apprehended at our southern border.And Congress continues to refuse to act to close the loopholes that are being used by cartels and drug traffickers to entice people to make the long and dangerous journey north to our southern border.The American people want to see a Congress focus where this president and our team are focused and that is under security, on securing our border, on closing loopholes, bringing about asylum reform and advancing the kind of policies that will continue to create jobs in this booming economy.BARTIROMO: Well, what we saw at the border was actually quite extraordinary. The children in these dangerous positions. Women are renting out their kids, $140 apparently so smugglers can bring children over the border.Are you expecting real reform on immigration? Will the Congress actually take that up in terms of changing the Flores decision, the asylum standards? Is that even doable this year?PENCE: It has to happen. President Trump has taken decisive action to call on Mexico to take further action, to intervene in this massive flow of people that are coming north from Central America to our border to come into our country and take advantage of those loopholes.And the President is also going to continue to call on this Congress to pass the kind of common sense reforms. Look, we have a humanitarian and a security crisis at our southern border. I mean the drug cartels and human traffickers, you heard it firsthand, they are telling people in Guatemala and El Salvador and throughout Central America about loopholes in our laws. And that if they come up with children that they'll have the opportunity to come into our country. And that's just unacceptable.This Congress ought to be willing to set politics completely aside and -- at minimum bring about the kind of changes in our asylum laws that would fix this immediate problem overnight.We are building a wall. We are building hundreds of miles of wall over the next several years. the President kept his promise in that regard. We are providing resources for Customs and Border Protection but we have to close the loopholes in our law. And the action the President has taken and will continue to take are all designed to say that Congress needs to step up, bring about the kind of reforms that will close these loopholes and end that magnet that drug cartels and human traffickers are using and will continue to call on Mexico and take actions necessary to see through that Mexico does their job to ensure that this mass exodus and humanitarian crisis comes to an end.BARTIROMO: Let me move on to China. This weekend the retaliatory tariffs from China on U.S. goods go into effect on the $60 billion of U.S. goods. Are we at a stalemate at this point? Do you see an end to the China fight?PENCE: Well, I would tell you that it's been -- it's been amazing to watch this president and the way that he's forged relationships with leaders around the world. You know, being with Prime Minister Trudeau here in Canada, seeing the way he was able to negotiate USMCA with Canada and Mexico.And it all begins with President Trump with personal relationships and I've witnessed it. The relationship people saw with Prime Minister Abe in high relief that now has us talking about free trade agreement with Japan. The President will be traveling to -- to the U.K. just in a few days and you'll see that relationship writ large as he visits with the Queen and -- and as we continue to talk to the E.U. about -- the possibility of a free trade agreement even as Brexit continues to work its way through for the U.K.But with regard to China, I can attest firsthand that the President has forged a good relationship with President Xi. But we have our differences and it's not just the structural -- it's not just the fact that China is half of our international trade deficit. It is those structural issues -- intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers, essentially the respect for private property that at this point China has not reflected in their practices and we need to see reforms in that regard.BARTIROMO: These are the big-ticket items, I know.PENCE: These are the big-ticket items and we have made it very, very clear with the Chinese leadership that these are the things that have to be addressed. President Trump will be meeting with President Xi when he goes to the G20 in just a few short weeks and we remain hopeful that China will step forward.They were coming our direction. We have made great progress but as the President said last week, they started to step backwards and so the President called it off and we believe we are in a very strong position with the tariffs that we've imposed. We could more than double those against China.But the President hopes for better. He hopes we can make a deal with China that will reset relationship put American jobs and American workers first and really level the playing field in ways that it's never been leveled in modern history of our relationship with China.BARTIROMO: It was interesting to see how aligned you were with Justin Trudeau on China given the fact that you both discussed the what you call the wrongful detention of two Canadian citizens --PENCE : Right.BARTIROMO: after CFO of Huawei was arrested. Have you gotten a response from China on this, what are you expecting in terms of two citizens that are being detained?PENCE: China knows where we stand. The wrongful detention of two Canadian citizens and Prime Minister Trudeau and I discussed it at length today. And that it's just unacceptable and the United States is going to continue to stand with Canada until those Canadians are free and hopefully back home in Canada.But the whole issue of Huawei is an issue of national security. I mean Huawei is in effect a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Chinese communist party. And to have Huawei operating as 5G network in our country or in our allies' countries we believe represents fundamental compromise of our national security and the privacy of millions of citizens.So we're going to continue to communicate that message very strongly to our allies in Canada and all over the western world. But we are also going to continue to promote alternatives for 5G networks.,Look, this is the most dynamic, innovative economy in the history of the world. We know we could meet that global need for 5G with enterprises that respect our values, respect privacy, individual rights, intellectual property and preserves our national security and we'll continue to drive that.(END VIDEOTAPE)MCDOWELL: Part 3 of Maria's interview -- exclusive interview with the Vice President coming up at 8:00 a.m., the top of the hour. Stay tuned for that.We are watching this futures selloff this morning -- 280 point lose on the Dow futures. President Trump threatening tariffs on Mexico over immigration -- the announcement seemingly came out of nowhere and the markets rattled.Stay with us.MCDOWELL: A major selloff at hand, Dow futures are off by 277 points at the moment. This comes as President Trump has threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in response to the migrant surge into this country.President Trump coming to the aid of U.S. corn farmers affected by the trade impasse with China. These are farmers that potentially would be hurt by a fight with Mexico.Cheryl Casone has more on this. Hey -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes -- Dagen.So basically the Trump administration is expected to announce today, it's going to lift the ban on ethanol for the summer. This is according to the "Wall Street Journal". Used in gasoline it's got that 15 percent mix of ethanol will be sold all year long instead of just for eight months out of the year.All companies and environmentalists are concerned about higher gas prices and increased air pollution are expected to sue the block for this move by the administration.Well, Costco warning that the trade deadlock is going to likely lead to higher prices. Costco CFO said, quote, "At the end of the day prices will go up on things. We want to be the last to raise them and when prices are going down, we want to be the first to lower them.Let's take a look at shares of the company -- actually up more than 18 percent so far this year.And German Chancellor Angela Merkel taking a swipe during a commencement speech at Harvard. Merkel never mentioned the President by name but she warned students against, quote, "building walls and taking a going alone approach.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR: Tear down walls of ignorance and narrow-mindedness while nothing has to stay as it is.(END VIDEO CLIP)Casone: Well, Merkel has served as chancellor since 2005. She announced she's stepping down in 2021. She has clashed with President Trump on issues of trade and, of course, Dagen -- of immigration which the Europeans have had to deal with as well like we have here in this country.MCDOWELL: Thank you -- Cheryl. Maybe worry about your own country -- rising anti-Semitism, a migrant crisis that led to sexual assault of multiple women over the holidays a few years ago.Mike Murphy -- what do you have to say about them?MUPRHY: I think people need to check themselves a little bit and start acting, people read headlines and get crazy, act like normal people, treat people the way you want to be treated.MCDOWELL: Yes. Those commencement addresses --KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR; Why can't they just focus on the people who are graduating?MCDOWELL: Yes. Thank you.TIMPF: Right.MCDOWELL: Send us off into the -- send them off into the wild blue yonder with some upbeat information.Breaking news futures point to a sell off this morning. President Trump threatening tariffs on Mexico over immigration.Plus the Trump economy -- Maria talks about it during her exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence. That's ahead.MCDOWELL: Breaking news -- a major selloff in the making, U.S. futures are pointing to a 280-point loss, again, the markets rattled by the threat of tariffs on Mexican import into the United States trying to curb the flow of central American families through Mexico and across our border.Coming out of nowhere, again --- it's been a rough market in the month of May. We've had an inversion of yield curve where longer-term interest rates are now below short-term interest rates. Investors seeming to bet that the Federal Reserve is going to have to cut interest rates. We will get to more of that with Steve Moore coming up.Meantime moving to more of Maria's exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence. She sat down yesterday in Canada where she asked Vice President about his pro-life stance.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Mr. Vice President -- let me switch gears for a moment. These recent rulings on abortion have put the issue back on front page. Do you want to see Roe v. Wade challenged?PENCE: Well, I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it. I couldn't be more proud to be a part of a pro-life administration. From early in this administration President Trump has taken decisive action to stand for the right to life at home and abroad. And it's a great source of -- it's a great source of meaning to me to be a part of that.President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history. And we hope for the day today that we see the sanctity of life restored to the center of American law.BARTIROMO: Are you comfortable leaving the decisions to the states?PENCE: Well, ultimately that's a decision that goes to the American people. I mean what Roe versus Wade was all was a decision that literally took the decision away from the political process and where all 50 states had banned abortion before Roe versus Wade and that all changed with that decision.And so for our part, returning legislation not so much to the states as to the American people. And I just -- I have to tell you as I look around the country today, I think life is winning in America.More and more young people are embracing the sanctity of life, we are seeing states around the country that are taking efforts to advance sanctity of life in laws. The Supreme Court just this last week have held a portion of an Indiana law that I've signed when I was governor of the state and the contrast, Maria, with the other party, this week in Illinois, again, we see the Democrats lurching toward late-term abortion and even infanticide.And I think more and more Americans see the importance of standing for the uniqueness and preciousness of every human life. And I'm proud to be a part of an administration that stands for the right to life.(END VIDEOTAPE)MCDOWELL: More of Maria's exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence coming up.Meantime futures are pointing to a major selloff this morning as President Trump threatens tariffs on Mexico over immigration.Plus U.S. trade disputes putting the Federal Reserve in a bind, why some see tensions as a threat. The wait-and-see approach by the Fed -- how long can it hold on to that 10-year yield down this morning. Again, money flowing into treasuries, buying sending the yield lower 2.16 percent.More straight ahead.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday May 31st.Breaking news, markets selling off in direct response to President Trump threatening tariffs on Mexico over immigration. The president ready to impose escalating tariffs that would start at five percent on June 10th and potentially escalate go up to 25 percent by October the first. Maria sat down for an exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence who weighed in on U.S. economy and the 2020 race.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Whether it's Joe Biden or any of the rest of them, this is a president whose standing for a strong national defense, he's promoted policies that have this economy booming. I mean, we're making appointments to our courts at every level that are upholding the constitution of the United States, free and fair trade, I can't wait to take that case to the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Vice President Pence also discussing China trade as a new round of tariffs on American goods that are exported from here over there are set to go into effect tomorrow. Big exclusive interview more of that coming up.Trade fears hitting the markets, Futures are showing heavy losses across the board after loss of the morning so far. But nevertheless a 266-point loss on the Dow Futures to wrap up this month. It's been a rough month, rough May for your -- all your major market gauges. The Dow down more than five percent, the NASDAQ down more than 6-1/2 percent in May. Dow transports again often indicator of future economic activity, 8-1/2 percent in May.Trade-related stocks this morning getting hammered, General Motors, the hardest-hit, down 5-1/4 percent, again, a lot of activity, business activity across the border business between Mexico and the United States for General Motors.In Europe, you have a selloff in the making as well. England, France and Germany all suffering losses this morning, the hardest hit the DAX in Germany off 1-2/3 of a percent.In Asia overnight, stocks mostly in the red with only South Korea heading higher.We begin this half hour with simmering trade tensions, President Trump threatening to hit Mexico with five percent tariffs on all goods import into the United States, ramping up his efforts to secure the southern border. The president says the tariffs will kick in next month and will gradually increase to 25 percent if the surge of illegal immigrants does not stop.This comes just ahead of China's retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. taking effect at midnight tonight, Maria Bartiromo spoke exclusively with Vice President Pence. He weighed in on the impact of the trade dispute on the U.S. economy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: You are just back from a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, how are you going to get USMCA across the finish line?PENCE: Well, first and foremost, let's recognize that the American economy is booming, 5.8 million new jobs in the last quarter 3.1 percent growth. More importantly wages are rising at the fastest level in more than 10 years and we've seen 500,000 manufacturing jobs created and the -- and the president has done all that because he drove for tax cuts, he's been rolling back federal red tape, we've been unleashing American energy but also a central pillar of President Trump's vision for this growing economy is the kind of free and fair and reciprocal trade that we've negotiated in the USMCA.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Joining us now, FreedomWorks Economic consultant and Trumponomics author, Stephen Moore. Steve, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.STEPHEN MOORE, ECONOMIC CONSULTANT, FREEDOMWORKS: Thank you.MCDOWELL: President Trump's threat to put tariffs on imports coming in from Mexico, it clearly -- even though he had mentioned it earlier, it took investors by surprise, why now and does it damage the U.S. economy potentially?MOORE: Well, look, Dagen, I've been someone who's been supportive of what Trump is doing in China, I think that's the epic battle of our time. I think China is a menace increasingly both from a security and economic standpoint to the United States. I'm a bit puzzled frankly about this new action against Mexico. I think the timing is wrong, you know, we want to isolate China as the bad actor.And you know, you just heard that discussion with the vice president and I agree with everything that he said, you know, we want to pass the Canada- Mexico trade agreement so we have that North American free trade zone and this seems to run counter to that. So I am a bit puzzled by it. I'm hoping, Dagen, that this is just kind of a tactic that Donald Trump is using to try to get Mexico to be more cooperative on the -- on the border which we all want but I'm a little bit nervous about this new tactic.MCDOWELL: Steve, Mike Murphy is here, he has a question for you.MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER & CEO, ROSECLIFF: Steve, I'm wondering, so you know, you have the tariffs with China that I think a lot of people at first were negative on and then came around too. Could -- I see this as possibly watering that down a little bit that you know, maybe people could look at this and say the president's going to use the tariff as a tool to win political disputes, can you speak to that?MOORE: Yes, I mean, I think that is a -- that is a concern that every time we have a dispute with a country, we use tariffs or retaliatory measure. I don't like that approach. And you know, I'm a free-trade guy, as I said I think that the strategy should be and one I think almost all Americans really agree with is get very, very tough with China, they have become an existential threat to the United States. One of the abusive relationship with China that can't continue.But, you know, I've always advised the White House that let's try to isolate China as the bad actor and have our allies, you know, solemnly in our -- in our camp on this. But Mexico is not a security threat to the United States, they're one of our great allies. And so, I am -- you know, and I'm a big supporter of this president, I just don't like this policy and you know, I also work at the Heritage Foundation and we are concerned about it.So, you know, free traders do have a concern as you just said that all of a sudden tariffs will simply be used or any time a country does something we don't like, we're going to use a tariff, I'm not so sure that's the best approach.MCDOWELL: And before we get to Jonas, Steve, he has a question for you. I do want to point out that Chuck Grassley in the Senate has come out and called this a misuse of presidential tariff authority, he's come out against these tariffs on Mexican imports.Joni Ernst has just come out this morning making a statement saying that she -- it's clear that we need to address the unprecedented flow of illegal immigrants and that that's imperative but that being said, the livelihood of Ohio -- Iowa farmers and producers are at stake. Go ahead, Steve.MOORE: Can I make a point about this, Dagen?MCDOWELL: Yes.MOORE: I mean, I think it is an interesting constitutional issue about, look, as I read the constitution, you know, the Congress has the authority to tax, tariffs are taxes, in some -- in some instances I think they're a useful tactic as against China.But I think these senators make a good point, you know, shouldn't the Congress be the one -- if we're going to impose the tariff on Mexico, shouldn't Congress be the one that enacts that?MCDOWELL: Right.MOORE: And it starts in the House of Representatives and so and so. This is I think a legitimate gripe that some in the Congress have about this use of executive authority.MCDOWELL: Right.JONAS MAX FERRIS, CO FOUNDER, MAXFUNDS.COM: Stephen, Jonas Ferris. You know, it's very easy to get bogged down in the legality of the tariff thing, whether constitution allows it or whether it's a violation of the old NAFTA or reason the security loophole which is obviously overblown as a way to do it. But just like fundamentally the whole idea of a trade agreement is so like G.M. can go build a factory somewhere else, spend billions of dollars and then not have all the sudden be a political change in some other countries where there's Canada, Mexico, here. And then all of a sudden the game's different and there's a whole new tariff. That's the whole point of it, I would imagine fundamentally going to all of them.Does this -- does this kind of tariffs violate our strength going forward to be in agreements that a countries can trust us or are countries going to make, you know what, this is specifically about China being totally ridiculous and not even have any real trade to be with America and Mexico not doing anything about people -- illegal immigrants coming across the border, we can still trust America in actual trade agreements fundamentally?MOORE: Well, look, the president has a legitimate gripe as I think the American people do that Mexico is not doing enough to stem this tide of illegal immigration.By the way, I'm very pro-immigration. The president has said he's pro- immigration but they've got to come in legally and we've got to regulate and secure our border. So, I'm with him on that. I ht think -- I'm scratching my head about why he thinks that this is the best tactic. You know, to use -- to stem that kind of illegal immigration. I don't want to --MCDOWELL: Steve, I want to interrupt you real quick. Do you think that the Federal Reserve is forced now to cut interest rates? The market seems to be seen in that signal this morning. And finish your though but I wanted to get that in there.MOORE: OK, well, I mean, I think that's my point. (INAUDIBLE) Canada and Mexico are our allies and we want to get USMCA sign in the law so that we have this free trade agreement and now you've got the president say, well, maybe we're going to put 5, 10, 15 percent tariff on Mexico at the same time we're trying to pass this in the Congress. I think it's a mixed message.Now, and the Fed, as you know Dagen, I have some purely strong feelings about this. I've been saying for the last six months that the Fed should be lowering rates because we've got -- look at what's happening with the farmers, look what's happening to our commodity prices, they're falling dramatically. The inverted yield curve right now is a sign that people are more worried about deflation than inflation. So the Fed should raise -- I mean, should be cutting rates but they shouldn't be doing it because, quote, the economy is slowing down. They should be doing it because the economy needs more dollar liquidity and that's what the markets are saying through interest rates, through the prices of everything from oil to cotton to -- you know, wheat and soybeans. You know, that's the -- that's the biggest problems for the farmers right now, it's not even the trade war. It's this continuous decline in these prices that Dagen, predates the trade war with China.MCDOWELL: Great to see you. We cover a lot of ground, Steve. Take care, please come back soon. Steve Moore.MOORE: Have a great weekend. Thank you.MCDOWELL: You as well. In case you missed it, here is some of this week's top moments from the show.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: I can assure the American people, this president is going to continue to remain focused on this economy, that's how we got done everything we've gotten done so far. I mean, the largest tax reform and tax cuts in American history. This president's cut back more federal regulation in 2-1/2 years than any president in American history, unleash American energy, the USCMA along with other trade agreements that we've negotiated with South Korea and one offs in other countries. All is evidence that this president is focused on jobs, he's focused on growth and we're going to continue to maintain that focus until we get USMCA across the finish line.BARTIROMO: What are the implications of no trade deal with China?MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: You know, we may not get a deal. I couldn't tell you the answer to that. Much will turn on whether China's prepared to do what President Trump has asked them to do.Huawei is an instrument of the Chinese government, they're deeply connected. It's something it's hard for Americans to understand. We would -- companies cooperate with United States government that is they comply with our laws. But no president directs an American private company, that's very different in China. They just simply operate under a different set of rules. I'm convinced that there's no power in the world that America couldn't if required handle in a way that would protect America's interest.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Apparently we're close to a deal and then the Chinese stepped back, that's not a good sign. And then we are also seeing a rising number of complaints by American companies who export to China or who import items from China that are critical that are finish product who are complaining about nontariff obstacles to trade.ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK POLITICAL ANALYST: The key thing is the farmers in Midwest, how do they feel about all of this? That's a very important part any Republican candidate. So, you know, I think if that gets resolved and they feel pretty good about things and they -- normal production and normal prices, then its fine. If they have a real serious recession and they're hurt badly, despite of the president trying to bail them out that could have some impact.BARTIROMO: What kind of an impact do you see from retaliatory tariffs?JOHN PAUL DEJORIA, CHAIRMAN AND COFOUNDER, PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS: Of course, what I see is this will be resolved in a relatively short period of time, both sides get hurt by it, China gets hurt by it even more. I already have talked to other fellows that it would affect if they do go to effect, and all they're all set up to do is just have price increases temporarily because they don't think it's going to last very long.BARTIROMO: You lived in China for seven years?MICHEL DOUKERIS, NORTH AMERICA CEO, ANHEUSER-BUSCH: Seven years.BARTIROMO: Tell me -- tell me about your experiences there?DOUKERIS: So there was an interesting time, was the time of integration of Anheuser-Busch InBev. We had good business in China, growing business, great opportunity, the biggest market globally for beer this China and we had a very interesting time there.ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL: Prosecutors simply have decide whether there was sufficient evidence to go forward to prosecute, if as Mueller says there never could have been a prosecution if the president under the constitution, then why was he appointed?SEAN REYES, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF UTAH: These are the veterans that we see in our states that they deserve to have some relief and we have asked, urged the Department of Education to implement a program that would automatically discharge the debt. On average they carry around 24,000 by statistics, 42,000 or so of these veterans who are totally and permanently disabled due to their military service.CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY'S SOLUTION: The most dangerous thing that I've seen, Maria, is letting young adults come home without any kind of financial expectation, you're actually setting them up for failure.BARTIROMO: Your dream is to be the first astronaut to go to Mars, why?ABIGAIL HARRISON, FOUNDER, MARS GENERATION: Because I think that it's the next step that the United States and the world as a whole needs take and someone needs to be willing to take that step. And so, from an early age I decided that I had a passion for space travel and I wanted to help push humanity forwards in that regard.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: We have major selloff in the making this morning. President Trump threatening tariffs on Mexican import into the U.S. in response to the surge of migrants coming across our border. Again, one analyst describing it as another bomb being thrown, the economic bomb of tariffs and it certainly rattling markets. We have 268 point loss on the Dow Futures to wrap up the month of May, what is been a rough month for stocks, losses of five to 6-1/2 percent on the major market gauges and more selling today. Certainly this morning, leading to the opening bell.Meantime, measles cases in the U.S. reaching a 25-year high, Cheryl Casone has the details, hi, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's incredible, Dagen, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say 971 cases have been reported so far this year, including 91 cases this past week and a half alone in just five months. Measles cases have surpassed the number reported in all of 1994. Measles have been declared eliminated in the U.S. 19 years ago, the CDC now warning that could end if cases aren't curved by fall.Well, Facebook admitting it has work to do when it comes to fighting vaccine information. The Wall Street Journal's reporting that 10 weeks to promising to crack down on the problem anti-vaccine content is so widely available on Facebook and the Instagram app. Facebook says it's still working on tools to detect the ban content. And Facebook shareholders have again we should say rejected a proposal to split Mark Zuckerberg's role as chairman and CEO.Well, the wait is finally over. Star Wars: Galaxy Edge opening at Disneyland in California today. It took more than five years to develop this and finish, of course, this big new attraction. Disney CEO Bob Iger speaking about the theme park in an interview with our own Deirdre Bolton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOB IGER, CEO, DISNEY: The incredible passion the "Star Wars" fans have for even the smallest detail. I think the imaginary is head to up their game but they love that challenge. And anyone -- you know, all the "Star Wars" fans get a chance to see this, I think they're going to -- even they will be impressed.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: That was Disneyland. Disney World in Florida planning to open its own "Star Wars" theme attraction coming in August of this year.And coming up next, we've got a sharp selloff on our hands this morning. Futures pointing to a decline as President Trump is threatening tariffs on Mexico over immigration. Dow is down 265 in the premarket right now, we'll be right back.MCDOWELL: Selloff in the making, 260 some point loss on the Dow Futures as all the major market gauges wrap up what's been a really rough month for stocks. And again, this selling triggered almost solely by President Trump threatening tariffs on Mexican import. Again, why now, people searching for an answer.A reality check in the meantime for the two-time defending champion the Golden State Warriors, Jared Max has the highlights from last night's NBA Finals opener in Toronto. Hi, Jared.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Dagen, happy Friday. The Warriors are not in such a golden state after last night's opener in Toronto just as they did in both regular season games against the Raptors, the Warriors lost. First NBA Finals game ever outside the United States. Toronto led after every quarter, they were up 10 by half time. And Pascal Siakam lead 14 of 17 shots, he scored 32, Kawhi Leonard had 23, Marc Gasol 20 and the Raptors win Game 1 118-109.Rap and Raptor super fan Drake trying to get under Steph Curry's skin for Game 1. Drake wore Steph's father jersey from when Dell Curry was a Raptor. Love the Drake, hate the Drake, he's become part of the Raptors narrative. Even got into it with the Warriors Draymond Green after the game. Draymond said, it really wasn't a scuffle because I didn't hit him and he did not hit me.

Duo causes problems for some studentsMiami Student: Miami UniversityMay 14, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 811 wordsBodyA semester after Miami University implemented Duo, the two-factor authentication tool, some students at Miami are annoyed by the system and do not think that the extra layer of security is worth it.Duo has been implemented at a number of schools across the U.S. with minimal issues. Miami's IT department knew that the solution could work in academia, and it was unlikely that they would run into any problematic scenarios that hadn't already been addressed at other universities.Joe Bazeley, assistant vice president of security, compliance and risk management, said he was confident in Miami's choice to move to Duo."Lots of other schools are going down this path," Bazeley said."We were not the first, and we are not the biggest ... We started looking around at what other schools were putting in place, and the overwhelming majority are using Duo."Bazeley and the IT department ran into challenges with Duo within its first semester of use and tried their best to address them as quickly as possible.One of the biggest issues occurs when a student or professor runs Duo and it tells them that their software is out of date. When Duo runs, it looks at a couple of different things including how old an individual's software is as well as how old their web browser is. If either of those things are over a year old, Duo won't work. This is for security reasons; old software and web browsers are more easily hacked.Students have been unable to access any Miami-affiliated site in China. According to The Washington Post, the "Great Firewall of China" is a method that the Chinese government uses to both limit and monitor website usage. Bazeley believes that this is a challenging problem for the IT department because the Chinese government decided two months ago that Duo is on the list of sites that its citizens cannot visit.In short, an individual in China cannot download or use Duo. This is a problem for Miami's many Chinese international students when they go home on breaks.The IT department is able to see an individual's location when they send a complaint that they are unable to access Duo and, if they are located in China, the IT department sends them a bypass code. A bypass code is a specific nine-digit numerical code that allows individuals to access Duo without sending a request to their device.The IT department also received a list of admitted international students from the International Student and Scholar Service, and IT is able to give all of those students a bypass from Duo."I hate Duo and also like Duo," Wenjaun Ge, a Chinese international student  majoring in computer science and software engineering, said. "Sometimes [it's] too much trouble."Ge started using Duo during J-term of 2019. She completed a course over J-term back in China and had to login to the school system everyday to access her emails, myMiami and BannerWeb. Ge found that Duo was incredibly difficult to use.In China, she had to use Cisco AnyConnect VPN, a security company that delivers multiple services to protect user's information, to connect to her Duo account. She found that she could not use the option of only logging in every 14 days and had to use a six-digit VPN code every time she wanted to login."I have no record of logging in VPN successfully at one time," Ge said. "It usually [took] more than five connections for a VPN to work properly. This takes a lot of time."Students living in dorms have to pay their RA seven dollars if they get locked out of their room."I hate how you have to have two devices to login to Duo because I don't always have both with me," first-year Ashlynn Brooks majoring in psychology said. "It [is] also so irritating if I leave my phone inside my room and don't have my key. I have to pay my RA money to get inside my own room because I can't ask a friend to help me get into my own dorm. It worked last semester, and now it won't. Duo is just an inconvenience for me."Other students who are able to understand the security risks believe that Duo does help them."Overall, I think the program has been effective in protecting our information," Cole Hankins, Speaker of the Student Senate of Associated Student Government at Miami, said. "The biggest thing is that we are adapting to Duo, and that our IT department is working alongside with Duo. It has been as good as it can be."Although many students have various opinions on the implementation of Duo in its first semester of use, Bazley said it isn't going anywhere."Duo, or any other two-factor authentication tool, will stay at Miami forever. There is always a need for additional security," Bazeley said. "The only thing that might change is tweaks in the system to implement further safety for our students, staff and professors."haubence@miamioh.eduShare this:• Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)• Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Load-Date: May 14, 2019End of Document

Chinese woman arrested at Mar-a-Lago set for bail hearingStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeApril 11, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 698 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyA woman by the name ofYujing Zhang was arrested on March 30 attempting to bluff her way into Donald Trump's private Florida club.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said last week the leadership of the group Zhang identified as her host had "apparent connections" to a Chinese Communist Party unit called the United Front Work Department.A Chinese woman charged with bluffing her way into PresidentDonald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida resort last month, renewing concerns about security at the club, appeared in court on Monday at a hearing to determine whether she will remain in custody, according to USA media.The federal magistrate judge who held the hearing on Monday will decide next week if Yujing should stay in jail until she is tried, or be released to live in the United States as she awaits trial.He said Zhang would be a "serious risk of flight" if she were released while awaiting trial, as she has no ties to the United States."She lies to everyone she encounters", prosecutorRolando Garcia told the court, according to CNN. Zhang's federal public defender,Robert Adler, dismissed federal prosecution claims she is in any way tied to foreign espionage. While at first glance plugging in Zhang's sketchy USB drive may look like a case of a monumental security screw-up, if a cybersecurity expert were to plug it into a specific computer with the goal of checking it for malware, then we would say they were doing their job. The man told her she could attend the "United Nations Friendship Event" and possibly get the chance to talk to a member of Trump's family about economic relations between the USA and China.Zhang told a Secret Service agent at the checkpoint outside the Palm Beach club that she was a member and wanted to use the pool.Secret Service agents took Zhang to a different location to interview her, at which point she became "verbally aggressive", according to the charging document.Asus ROG Phone successor to launch in third quarterThat's before accounting for the many accessories that allow the ROG Phone to become a handheld console or (weak) gaming PC . Just like the ROG phone, we can expect its successor to be powered by top of the line hardware for gaming.In testimony before the court, a Secret Service agent said thatYujing Zhang was in possession of a thumb drive, or USB drive, containing a highly active form of malware which immediately began to install itself when plugged into the agent's computer.Secret Service agentSamuel Ivanovich told the judge that when an agency analyst uploaded the malware found on Zhang's thumb drive, it immediately began installing on the analyst's computer and corrupting its files.They described Zhang's attempted entry of the club as amateurish, but said they are evaluating whether it was intended as a test of the presidential property's security.Agents say she wasn't on the membership list, but a club manager thought Zhang was the daughter of a member.A former US government expert on Chinese intelligence operations, who asked not to be named while discussing sensitive information, said investigators would want to know "why, exactly, was she there?"Zhang's arrest has raised questions about Mar-a-Lago's security during the president's visits. He said Zhang said an acquaintance named "Charles" had invited her to the nonexistent event.She went through a second Secret Service checkpoint, this one where she was screened by a magnetometer for weapons or explosives, before making her way to the club's reception area. Lee worked to advertise the events on Chinese-language social media with Li"Cindy" Yang, the South Florida massage-parlor owner who ran a separate business that promised Chinese clients photos and meetings with Trump. PresidentDonald Trump was in Florida at the time, but was off-site at a nearby golf course during the incident.A prosecutor says the Federal Bureau of Investigation is still investigating whether a Chinese woman accused of lying to illegally enter PresidentDonald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida is a spy. "Due to a potential language barrier issue, Mar-a-Lago believed her to be the relative of member Zhang and allowed her access onto the property".Load-Date: April 11, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 25 of 446IDTechEx Research Asks if 5G is Slowing Down in China  Page 27 of 446Huawei executive labeled a 'moral vacuum' in heated UK hearing  Page 29 of 446Huawei executive labeled a 'moral vacuum' in heated UK hearing  Page 31 of 446ICYMI: MARCO RUBIO: CHINA 'CONTROLLING DEFENSE CYBER OPERATIONS' IN VENEZUELA  Page 33 of 446The 5G, the US war UU and China  Page  of China aims to ban bitcoin mining  Page 37 of 446How artificial intelligence systems could threaten democracy  Page 39 of 446Apple Earnings Could See 8% Hit From Trump's Huawei Blacklist, Cowen Says  Page 56 of 446Huawei Introduce G5 Hardware That Can Be Built Into Cars; Sen.
