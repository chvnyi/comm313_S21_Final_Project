Media Analyses: Restart Of US-China Talks, Ease Of Huawei Ban Boosts US StocksThe FrontrunnerJuly 2, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: WASHINGTON NEWSLength: 437 wordsBodyUnder the headline "US Stocks Climb As Traders Welcome US-China Trade Cease-Fire," the AP (7/1, Veiga) reports that US stocks "marched broadly higher late Monday afternoon after a cease-fire in the US trade war with China put Wall Street in a buying mood," and the S&P 500 index "was on track for its second all-time high in less than two weeks." Chipmakers "rallied on plans by the US to loosen some restrictions on sales to Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. Broadcom climbed 3.8% and Micron Technology gained 4%." Reuters (7/1, Jiang, Lee) also covers the impact of President Trump's decision to ease restrictions on US companies' transactions with Huawei.The Wall Street Journal (7/1, Otani, Davies, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports the S&P 500 added 22.57 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 2,964.33, its sixth record close of the year. The Nasdaq added 84.92 points to 8,091.16 and the Dow rose 117.47 points to end the day at 26,717.43.In an article titled "S&P And Dow Follow Global Markets Higher, As Investors Take Heart In Trade Thaw," the New York Times (7/1, Stevenson, Phillips, 18.61M) reports that "the information technology sector, which includes tech giants like Microsoft and Apple, was the best performing part of the United States market, rising more than 1.5 percent," and "a closely watched index of computer chip companies climbed more than 2.5 percent." The Times says the Administration's "ban on American firms' selling technology to...Huawei raised the risk that Beijing would retaliate against American tech firms." The Times adds that "investors appeared to be shaking off concerns about such risks after President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed on Saturday to resume negotiations geared toward resolving a trade war that has spooked markets around the world."Reuters (7/1, Randall) likewise attributes stocks' gains to this weekend's agreement to "restart trade talks." Reuters asserts that investors are "bet[ting] that a breakthrough between the world's two largest economies would jumpstart global economic growth." However, Bloomberg (7/1, 4.73M) reports that Zhu Ning, "who advises the Chinese government and central bank," says "the trade truce reached over the weekend between China and the US doesn't make a final deal any more likely." Zhu is quoted as saying, "With Donald Trump in office I don't think it makes any difference." According to Bloomberg, Zhu contends that "we're not any closer to having a deal...adding that he thought both seemed to be more optimistic or cooperative after the truce in Argentina in December compared to now."Load-Date: July 2, 2019End of Document

Trump attacks on Google recycle baseless claimsAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 20, 2019 Tuesday 9:37 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 1144 wordsByline: BY RACHEL LERMAN, AP Technology WriterDateline: SAN FRANCISCO BodySAN FRANCISCO (AP) - President Donald Trump has been on a tear about Google that traces back to a series of unfounded claims about the technology giant circulating among conservatives. Among those claims: that Google interferes with U.S. elections, is biased against conservatives and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.In several tweets issued this August, Trump assailed Google for alleged electoral interference and again brought up claims of its alleged secret involvement with the Chinese government. On Monday, the president reiterated a baseless claim that Google had "manipulated " the 2016 election in favor of Hillary Clinton, which his campaign's Twitter feed also picked up .All of these claims emerged from reports and commentary from conservative pundits and Trump supporters, none backed by convincing evidence. Google has also denied them."Distorting results for political purposes would harm our business and go against our mission of providing helpful content to all of our users," Google spokeswoman Julie Tarallo said.Here's where these claims emerged and what's known about them.ELECTION INTERFERENCEOn Aug. 6, Trump implicitly suggested that Google had favored Clinton's 2016 campaign over his and that the company planned to "illegally subvert" the 2020 election as well. On Monday he made the first part explicit , referencing an unspecified study that, he claimed, showed that "Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election."Trump won the presidency with an Electoral College majority but lost the popular tally to Clinton by almost 2.9 million votes. Trump has falsely insisted for years that he actually won the popular vote.The president's campaign Twitter feed suggested Monday that Trump referenced a 2017 study by psychologist Robert Epstein that found Google showed more pro-Clinton results to undecided voters than pro-Trump results. Google and others have questioned the methodology of the study, which was not peer reviewed by other researchers.In its final paragraph, the four-page study extrapolated experimental findings from a small group of 21 undecided voters to the electorate as a whole using mathematical models Epstein reported in an earlier paper. Reached by phone, Epstein said his results only showed that search results were biased toward Clinton, not that Google was doing so intentionally to sway elections.Epstein also noted that those extrapolated findings suggested a pro-Clinton vote shift of 2.6 million to 10 million votes, not the 16 million cited by Trump.Even that may be too much of a stretch, said Ramesh Srinivasan, an information-studies professor at UCLA, who noted that the study's finding of alleged search-result bias doesn't account for other possible influences on voters. "We can't jump to conclusions that it gave any a candidate millions of votes," he said.Like other researchers, Epstein and Srinavasan emphasize that they remain concerned about the opacity of tech platforms like Google and Facebook and their unbridled power to influence elections.CONSERVATIVE BIASIn his early August tweets, Trump singled out former Google engineer Kevin Cernekee, who claims Google fired him for posting Republican viewpoints on internal message boards. Google said Cernekee was fired for downloading confidential company documents onto a personal device.Cernekee apparently drew Trump's attention after he told Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Aug. 2 that Google executives "really want Trump to lose in 2020. That's their agenda." Cernekee offered no evidence for his claim."The statements made by this disgruntled former employee are absolutely false," Google's Tarallo said.Cernekee's situation reflects a larger belief among conservatives that major platforms such as Google and Facebook are biased against conservative viewpoints, both internally and on their public services. Republican legislators have convened several hearings on the subject.But experts say there's little evidence to support such claims, which the companies themselves have long denied."Trump wants to remind (big tech) that he is watching them," said Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland and an expert on algorithms and society. He pointed out that some also claim that Google-owned YouTube funnels viewers to far-right videos and conspiracy theories.All these allegations, Pasquale said, "assume that neutrality or objectivity means having half negative and half positive results." But if more negative pages about a person or topic exist on the web, he said, a search result will likely produce more negative results.Cernekee's personal situation may also be more complex than it first appeared. On Aug. 5, the conservative publication The Daily Caller published posts Cernekee made on Google message boards in which he called for a fund to help white nationalist Richard Spencer after he was punched by a protester.Cernekee told The Associated Press in a statement that he has "always supported free speech and opposed white nationalism," and that he spoke in opposition to other employees who supported Spencer getting punched.GOOGLE AND CHINATrump also indirectly referred on Aug. 6 to another unfounded claim gaining currency among conservatives, which is that Google is spurning the U.S. military and instead working with the Chinese. In mid-July, he tweeted about unsupported claims to that effect by technology investor Peter Thiel, a Trump supporter who is also a board member of Google rival Facebook.In an appearance on Fox News , Thiel offered no proof for claims that Google is working with the Chinese government on artificial intelligence projects and has "likely" been infiltrated by Chinese agents.Google left China in 2010, and confirmed this summer in a congressional hearing that it shut down an experimental program to relaunch a censored version of its search service in the country. Under pressure from its employees, it has also withdrawn from at least one Pentagon contract.Google said it has not been infiltrated, and executive Karan Bhatia denied Thiel's claims in a congressional hearing last month, saying "We take extremely seriously the threat of any penetration of our systems."Google does have an AI office in China, which it positioned as a way to employ Chinese engineers who specialize in AI research. Thiel wrote in a New York Times opinion piece that Google's close AI ties in China are bad for the U.S.Google said it still works with the Defense Department on other projects, including cybersecurity. And it denies working with the Chinese military.Others in Trump's administration have said Google's work in China isn't problematic. "I think they're working for our military, for America, not for China," Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said on Fox News last month.Load-Date: August 21, 2019End of Document

Sinovac Reports Unaudited Second Quarter 2019 Financial ResultsBusiness WireAugust 15, 2019 Thursday 8:05 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 4775 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodySinovac Biotech Ltd. (NASDAQ: SVA) ("Sinovac" or the "Company"), a leading provider of biopharmaceutical products in China, announced today its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019.Second Quarter and First Half of 2019 Financial Summary• Sales for the second quarter of 2019 were $64.0 million, a decrease of 14.8% from $75.2 million in the prior year period.• Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019, were $100.6 million, a decrease of 17.9% from $122.5 million in the prior year period.• Operating income for the second quarter increased 52.3% from the prior year period due to decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses.• Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2019, decreased 9.5% from the prior year period due to lower sales.• The Company posted $10.7 million of net income attributable to common shareholders, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share in the second quarter, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $5.7 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year period.• The Company posted $11.8 million of net income attributable to common shareholders, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share in the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $14.1 million, or $0.24 per basic and diluted share, in the comparative period.Business HighlightsMarketing and SalesOn June 30, 2019, the Vaccine Administration Law of the People's Republic of China, China's first legislation dedicated to vaccine management, was formally passed by the Chinese central government and will become effective on December 1, 2019. This legislation will implement stringent supervision of the entire process of vaccine development, production, delivery, and inoculation. The legislation mandates both government oversight and the duty of manufacturers to report compliance in all substantial aspects. Sanctions and penalties for producing and selling fake or substandard vaccines have been significantly increased. The new legislation is expected to raise the barriers to entry in the Chinese vaccine industry.Pipeline DevelopmentVaricella -The Company filed an application for a production license for its varicella vaccine with the National Medical Products Administration ("NMPA"), previously known as the China State Food and Drug Administration, in November 2017. The NMPA issued a Notice of Site Inspection to the Company on May 24, 2019 and the Site Inspection began in late July. The Company expects the license to be issued in 2020.23-valent Pneumococcalpolysaccharidevaccine (or PPV-23) - The Company submitted its application for a production license in 2017. In 2018, the NMPA requested a supplementary submission, which has been completed. The NMPA is currently conducting a review of the Company's submission.Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (or QIV) - The Company filed an application for a production license with the NMPA in March 2019. Preliminary questions and answers have been submitted. Sinovac's application is currently under review and the Company expects the production license to be issued in 2020.Sabin Inactivated Polio vaccine (or sIPV) - The production license application was accepted by the NMPA in January 2019. In March 2019, given the high demand for effective polio vaccines, the application was granted fast track review. Currently, the application is under review and additional tests are to be performed.Mr. Weidong Yin, Chairman, President and CEO of the Sinovac commented, "We delivered strong net earnings this quarter while facing challenges from the external market environment and a lack of supply of certain products due to the production disruption in 2018 caused by the minority shareholder of our Beijing operating company."Mr. Yin continued, "We continue to make progress on our pipeline development. We expect the commercial launches of both varicella and QIV in 2020. In addition, we welcome the implementation of new vaccine legislation that will ultimately benefit high quality vaccine manufactures such as Sinovac as well as public health in China."Unaudited Financial Results for the Second Quarter of 2019Summary of sales and gross profit(In $000 except percentage data)2019 Q2% of Sales2018 Q2% of SalesHepatitis A vaccine - Healive®13,87021.7%17,26823.0%Hepatitis A&B vaccine - Bilive®-0.0%5,5527.4%Hepatitis vaccines subtotal13,87021.7%22,82030.4%Influenza vaccine-0.0%(208)(0.3%)EV 71 vaccine - Inlive®47,87374.7%52,54069.9%Mumps vaccine2,3023.6%-0.0%Total sales64,045100.0%75,152100.0%Cost of sales6,0929.5%10,54714.0%Gross profit57,95390.5%64,60586.0%Sales for the second quarter of 2019 were $64.0 million, a decrease of 14.8% from $75.2 million in the prior year period. The decrease was caused by zero sales of Bilive® and lower sales in Healive® and Inlive®. The sales decrease was partly offset by a sales increase in the mumps vaccine. Depreciation of the Chinese renminbi against the U.S. dollar accounted for $4.4 million of the decrease in 2019 second quarter revenue.The lack of Bilive® sales is still attributed to the suspended production of the product, which was the result of a lack of supply of the hepatitis B vaccine from the sole supplier.The decrease in Healive® sales was due to a product shortage caused by production suspension and disruptions resulting from actions of the minority shareholder of the Company's subsidiary, Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd, in Beijing in 2018. Production has returned to normal, and future sales are not expected to be adversely affected by product shortages. The decrease of Inlive® sales was in line with the general market trends.Gross profit in the second quarter of 2019 was $58.0 million, compared to gross profit of $64.6 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 90.5%, compared to 86.0% in the prior year period. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company had to write off all influenza vaccines and some hepatitis vaccines due to the production disruption caused by the minority shareholder of the Company's subsidiary in Beijing, which negatively impacted gross profit by $3.1 million.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2019 were $30.2 million, compared to $44.5 million in the prior year period. The Company incurred lower selling expenses in the second quarter of 2019 due to a difference in the timing of sales and marketing activities, and a lower general and administrative expenses were caused by reduced legal and consulting fees associated with the Company's ongoing litigation matters.R&D expenses in the second quarter of 2019 were $6.3 million, compared to $5.9 million in the prior year period, as the Company continued to invest in its pipeline of product candidates, including the sIPV, PPV and varicella vaccines.Net income in the second quarter of 2019 was $17.1 million, compared to $10.4 million in the prior year period. Net income increased due to decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses.Net income attributable to common shareholders was $10.7 million, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $5.7 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year period.As the Company announced on February 22, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors determined that certain shareholders became "Acquiring Persons," as defined in the Company's Rights Agreement ("Rights Agreement"), and a "Trigger Event" occurred under the Rights Agreement. As a result, new common and preferred shares of the Company were issued. Without the effect of the "Trigger Event" and the newly issued common and preferred shares, basic and diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2019 would be $0.17.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $23.0 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $17.5 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of 2019 was $18.0 million, compared to $13.1 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2019 were $0.12, compared to $0.15 per share in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2019 without the effect of the "Trigger Event" and the newly issued common and preferred shares would be $0.18 Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this earnings announcement.Unaudited Financial Results for the First Half of 2019Summary of sales and gross profit(In $000 except percentage data)2019 H1% of Sales2018 H1% of SalesHepatitis A vaccine - Healive®24,40224.2%25,85321.1%Hepatitis A&B vaccine - Bilive®-0.0%10,3448.4%Hepatitis vaccines subtotal24,40224.2%36,19729.5%Influenza vaccine-0.0%2,0631.7%EV 71 vaccine - Inlive®73,22572.8%84,11368.7%Mumps vaccine2,9723.0%1170.1%Total sales100,599100.0%122,490100.0%Cost of sales9,8719.8%13,33710.9%Gross profit90,72890.2%109,15389.1%Sales for the first half of 2019 were $100.6 million, a decrease of 17.9% from $122.5 million in the prior year period.

Net income decreased due to lower revenue.Net income attributable to common shareholders was $11.8 million, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $14.1 million, or $0.24 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year period.Without the effect of the "Trigger Event" under the Rights Agreement, as described above, and the newly issued common and preferred shares, basic and diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2019 would be $0.20.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $29.8 million in the first half of 2019, compared to $34.2 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income in the first half of 2019 was $21.9 million, compared to $24.0 million in the prior year period.

The Company expects that its current cash position will be able to support its operations for at least the next 12 months.The Company's Interim Financial Statements are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the Interim Financial Statements have not been audited or reviewed by the Company's independent registered accounting firm.Legal ProceedingsAs previously disclosed by the Company, on March 13, 2018, 1Globe Capital LLC ("1Globe") filed a complaint against the Company in the Antigua Court. The trial of the matter took place from December 3 to 5, 2018. On December 19, 2018, the Antigua judge handed down his judgment (the "Antigua Judgment"), finding in the Company's favor in full, dismissing 1Globe's claim and declaring that the Rights Agreement was validly adopted as a matter of Antigua law. On January 29, 2019, 1Globe filed a Notice of Appeal against the Antigua Judgment. On March 4, 2019, 1Globe filed an application for urgent interim relief, seeking an injunction to prevent the Company from continuing to implement its Rights Agreement until the resolution of the appeal. This application was heard on April 4, 2019, at which the Court of Appeal issued an order restraining the Company from operating the Rights Agreement in any way that affects 1Globe's rights or shareholding or otherwise distributing the exchange shares to the Company's shareholders who did not trigger the Rights Plan until after the determination of the appeal (the "Exchange Shares"). 1Globe's appeal against the Antigua Judgment will be heard in the week commencing September 16, 2019.As disclosed previously, on March 5, 2018, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking a determination whether 1Globe, The Chiang Li Family, OrbiMed Advisors, LLC and certain other shareholders of the Company had triggered the Rights Agreement. On April 12, 2018, 1Globe filed an amended answer to the Company's complaint, counterclaims, and a third-party complaint against the Company and Mr. Weidong Yin alleging, among other allegations, that the Rights Agreement is not valid. On March 6, 2019, the Delaware Chancery Court entered a status quo order providing that the Company not distribute any of the Exchange Shares to the Company's shareholders who did not trigger the Rights Plan until the final disposition of the pending Delaware litigation or further order of the Court. On April 8, 2019, the Delaware Chancery Court stayed the Delaware litigation pending the outcome of 1Globe's appeal of the Antigua Judgment.Status of Exchange Shares and Trading in the Company's SharesAs a result of the pending legal proceedings described above, the Exchange Shares are expected to remain in a trust for the benefit of the Company's shareholders who did not trigger the Rights Plan until, at least, the conclusion of the appeal against the Antigua Judgement and final disposition of the Delaware litigation or further order of the Delaware Chancery Court. The Exchange Shares remain issued and outstanding. The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC implemented a halt on trading of the Company's common shares at the time of issuance of the Exchange Shares to the trust and the Company is currently unable to estimate when trading will resume, or whether Nasdaq will take any additional action regarding the trading of the Company's common shares.About SinovacSinovac Biotech Ltd. is a China-based biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of vaccines that protect against human infectious diseases. Sinovac's product portfolio includes vaccines against enterovirus71 (EV71), hepatitis A and B, seasonal influenza, H5N1 pandemic influenza (avian flu), H1N1 influenza (swine flu), and mumps. Healive, the hepatitis A vaccine manufactured by the Company, has passed the assessment under WHO prequalification procedures in 2017. The EV71 vaccine, an innovative vaccine developed by Sinovac against hand foot and mouth disease caused by EV71, was commercialized in China in 2016. In 2009, Sinovac was the first company worldwide to receive approval for its H1N1 influenza vaccine, which it has supplied to the Chinese Government's vaccination campaign and stockpiling program. The Company is also the only supplier of the H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine to the government stockpiling program. The Company is developing a number of new products including a Sabin-strain inactivated polio vaccine, pneumococcal polysaccharides vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and varicella vaccine. Sinovac primarily sells its vaccines in China, while also exploring growth opportunities in international markets. The Company has exported select vaccines to over 10 countries in Asia and South America.

The Company assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking information contained in this release.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Sinovac uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures" in this results announcement.Sinovac believes that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that Sinovac includes in net income and diluted EPS. Sinovac believes that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS provide useful information about its core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from operations, net income, diluted EPS, or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of Sinovac's operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA represents net income and excludes interest and financing expenses, interest income, net other income (expenses) and income tax benefit (expenses), and certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expenses, amortization and depreciation that Sinovac does not believe are reflective of the core operating performance during the periods presented.Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expenses and foreign exchange gain or loss.Non-GAAP diluted EPS represents non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods on a diluted basis, including accounting for the effect of the assumed conversion of options.SINOVAC BIOTECH LTD.Consolidated Balance sheetsAs of June 30, 2019 and

Oranco, Inc. Releases 2019 Chairman Letter for ShareholdersGlobeNewswireAugust 22, 2019 Thursday 3:30 PM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: PRESS RELEASESLength: 1257 wordsBodyFenyang City, China, Aug.  22, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oranco, Inc. ("Oranco" or the "Company") (ORNC), a premium alcohol marketer and wholesaler in China, today released the following letter to shareholders from the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors.Dear Shareholder of Oranco,Oranco has achieved remarkable business success since our inception in 2013. Before going into details, I want to first express my appreciation to all my excellent colleagues at Oranco and to our valued business partners, investors, and customers. It is remarkable how much we have accomplished in the past years and I thank you all for your recognition, support and devotion.The Market OpportunitiesChina has a very long history of drinking culture and has an alcoholic beverage market with tremendous opportunities. The long-term demand for Chinese hard liquor, especially Fenjiu liquor, will continue to grow in China. The overall business environment has been optimistic due to the continuous economic growth evidenced by significant growth of Chinese nominal gross domestic product ("GDP"). China's per capita disposable income has also been increasing rapidly due to the increasing national wage level. In addition, China's urbanization rate has been improving greatly during the past decades and the Chinese government has set a goal to achieve 60% urbanization by 2020.Our Business ModelSince the inception of our business, we have positioned ourselves to become one of the most prominent wholesaler and marketer of our own branded liquor products. The Company devoted most of its financial and human resources to building its brand marketing capability and cooperative relationships with quality liquor manufacturers and highly experienced distributors. This general business strategy has resulted our strong brand operation and market development capability.The Company values the role of social media highly. In addition to traditional marketing methods such as promotion, advertising and campaigns, the Company is utilizing the power of Chinese social media applications such as WeChat and others to promote our brand name to more Chinese people.Our Sales/Marketing NetworkOur current strategy to capture market share is to partner with local distributors who compete in regional markets. In order to facilitate our cooperative relationship with local distributors, we plan to install smart sales machines and vending machines through tapping the power of artificial intelligence electronic payment technology (the "Smart Sales System"). We plan to strategically locate these machines to achieve maximum results in terms of neighborhoods coverage, unifying easy payment and fast delivery at regional levels. We expect to save significant labor costs through distributing these machines. In addition, the high-definition LED screens of our vending machines will serve as perfect advertising platforms and we expect increased partnership opportunities with other popular liquor brands as well.Long-Term and Mutually Beneficial PartnershipsHighly experienced and qualified distributors are our key business partners who bring our products to Chinese markets. We have adopted a business policy very favorable to these distributors to encourage them in reaching more customers in undeveloped markets. For new qualified distributors, our sales department will help them develop sales strategies and explore potential sales opportunities. In addition, we hold free tasting sessions for distributors' customers and explore investment opportunities to help our distributors achieve profitability as soon as possible.Key Strategies for 2019We are operating in a market with over RMB1 trillion worth of sales each year. Our current plan is to primarily focus on the marketing and wholesale of Fenjiu liquor while making a gradual transition to incorporate Luzhou-flavor and Maotai-flavor liquors in our product portfolio according to market demands.Our blockchain solution for liquor identification and collection has entered into its test stage recently. We believe such technology will assure the authenticity and further build the value of our premium products since we trust in the verification capabilities of blockchain, which will enable us to credibly assure the origins and authenticity of our premium alcoholic beverages. We look forward to officially launching the blockchain technology near the end of 2019. We will also commit to further developing and applying more new technologies that can increase the value of our products.We plan to expand our brand influence by covering regional markets with our sales outlets. Our planned Smart Sales System will be an important tool for increasing our sales coverage while gathering market information. We also plan to market our collectable liquor through our Smart Sales System to meet the needs of our high-end customers.We are working hard to build a leading brand in China. Our management team is striving to become more effective and responsible. Through our persistence and hard work, we hope to reap the full benefits of the investments we have made and the tremendous market opportunities we have identified.Thank you again for your support of Oranco.Sincerely,Mr. Peng YangChief Executive Officer and PresidentOranco, Inc.About Oranco, Inc.Headquartered in Fenyang City, China, Oranco, Inc. (ORNC), is engaged in the alcohol wholesale business in China. We currently focus our business on the sale of Chinese Fenjiu liquor and imported wines. Our goal is to promote premium alcoholic beverages to China's population. We aim to achieve this goal by catering to the ever-evolving tastes in alcohol through our creative marketing strategies and innovative product designs that target different age groups in China.

All Rights ReservedSection: Cruising and Travel News; ISSN: 1935-6501Length: 194 wordsBodyThe Chinese government has stopped issuing individual travel permits for Chinese visitors to the self-governing island of Taiwan, restricting travel to groups organised by travel agencies. China blamed deteriorating relations with what it considers to be a wayward province for the travel ban, which came into force on August 1. The number of Chinese visitors to Taiwan accelerated when direct air links between China and Taiwan were established in 2009, peaking at 4.18 million in 2015, but fell to 2.7 million in 2018.AirGuide Travel Media & Technology connects you to an affluent, influential group of business and leisure travelers from across the globe with Frequent Flyer Destinations Magazine, AirGuideOnline, AirGuide Destination Travel Guides, AirGuideBusiness, offering content solutions & technology + business intelligence software for the global travel and business markets.Editorial eMail: edit@AirGuideOnline.com For Advertising and Marketing Contacts For Custom Content and Content Solutions: content@AirGuideOnline.com Air & Travel Business Analysis: bizintel@AirGuideOnline.com Copyright (C) 2017 AirGuide / Pyramid Media Group.

In China they put a surveillance app on tourist cell phonesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 2, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 300 wordsBodyChinese border police are secretly installing on the cell phones of tourists entering their country a software that can copy mails, messages and track their movements.How China's social credit system worksAccording to the Guardiannewspaper, this occurs on the Asian giant's border with neighboring Kyrgyzstan, at a post in the city of Ikershtam."The Chinese government has reduced freedoms in Xinjiang province for the local Muslim population, installing facial recognition cameras on the streets and in mosques and reportedly forces residents to download software they are looking for in their phones," the British media says.Tourists are reportedly not alerted by border agents about what actions the application takes.Edin Omanovi?, of the Privacy International group, described the findings as "highly alarming in a country where downloading the app or the wrong item could take you to a detention camp."The software pursues a variety of terms associated with Islamist extremism, including Inspire, the English-language magazine produced by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and several weapons operation manuals.About 100 million people visit the Xinjiang region each year, according to Chinese authorities. These include domestic and foreign tourists, and most enter from other parts of the country.The Irkeshtam crossing is the westernmost border of China and is used by traders and tourists, some of them following the historic Silk Road.There are several stages to crossing, and in one of them travelers are required to unlock and deliver their phones and other devices, such as cameras.The devices are then taken to a separate room and returned some time later.iPhones are connected to a reader that scans them, while Android phones have the app installed to do the same job.Advertising       Load-Date: July 2, 2019End of Document

The day defined a red path on Wall Street after a disparate opening of the bags. China's new tariffs on U.S. products and threats of retaliation that President Donald Trump responded with increase risk aversion.The Nasdaq stock market's Nasdaq index is head losings, with a decline of -2.43%, Dow Jones, falling -1.93% on the S&P; 500, made up of the top 500 companies listed there, losing -1.93 percent. The most affected index at the moment is the Nasdaq 100, which makes up the 100 largest technology companies, at -2.53 percent.NDX Chart by TradingViewThe Chinese government announced that it will impose additional 5% tariffs on U.S. soybeans starting September 1 and 10% on wheat, corn and sipfrom since December 15, in a response to recently announced 10% tariffs against it from Washington . Donald Trump's response on Twitter did not take time.The U.S. representative wrote that he will order his country's companies to look for ways to shut down their China operations and manufacture more products in the United States. In another message he mentions that he will ask broadcasters like Fed Ex, which currently falls -3.51% and Amazon, -2.69%, to take some action on Chinese packages and products.The clear sign of escalation in the trade war strikes companies with operations in China, led by tech companies such as Apple, which currently registers a loss of -4.52 percent. Microsoft shares lose -3.29 percent. Intel's lose -3.55 percent.[email protected]Load-Date: August 24, 2019End of Document

The 10 percent tariff, if imposed, includes rough rice, which joins brown, milled, parboiled, and broken rice which are currently subject to a 25 percent tariff imposed in May.Yesterday, the Administration announced that the 10 percent tariffs would be delayed until December 15, but only for some products, including cell phones, laptop computers, video game consoles, certain toys, and items of footwear and clothing. Rough rice remains part of the proposed September 1 tariff implementation.Explaining the delay, President Trump said, "We're doing this for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on U.S. customers, which, so far, they've had virtually none."It is unclear whether this latest announcement of a delay in implementation for some products will reverse what was a widely reported edict from the Chinese government to stop buying U.S. agricultural products in response to the continued trade tensions. USA Rice is keeping a close eye on developments, particularly since the first ever private sale of rice between a U.S. mill and a Chinese buyer was successfully completed earlier this summer, signaling the official opening of the Chinese market to U.S.-grown rice.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6822650 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

Hong Kong police and protesters clash, ending violence lullAssociated Press InternationalAugust 24, 2019 Saturday 3:21 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 700 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) - Hong Kong protesters threw bricks and gasoline bombs at police, who responded with tear gas, as chaotic scenes returned to the summer-long anti-government protests on Saturday for the first time in nearly two weeks.Hundreds of black-clad protesters armed with bamboo poles and baseball bats fought with police officers wielding batons on a main road following a march against "smart lampposts" that was sparked by surveillance fears.The chaotic scenes unfolded outside a police station and a nearby shopping mall as officers in riot gear faced off with protesters who set up makeshift street barricades.The violence interrupted nearly two weeks of calm in Hong Kong, which has been gripped by a turbulent pro-democracy movement since June.Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd after repeated warnings "went futile," the government said in a statement. By early evening, most of the protesters had dispersed, though clashes flared up in other neighborhoods.Earlier in the day, some protesters used an electric saw to slice through the bottom of a smart lamppost, while others pulled ropes tied around it to send it toppling and cheered as it crashed to the ground.The protest march started peacefully as supporters took to the streets to demand the removal of the lampposts over worries that they could contain high-tech cameras and facial recognition software used for surveillance by Chinese authorities.The government in Hong Kong said smart lampposts only collect data on traffic, weather and air quality.The protesters chanted slogans calling for the government to answer the movement's demands. The protests began in June with calls to drop a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to China to stand trial, then widened to include free elections for the city's top leader and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality."Hong Kong people's private information is already being extradited to China. We have to be very concerned," organizer Ventus Lau said ahead of the procession.The semiautonomous Chinese territory has said it plans to install about 400 of the smart lampposts in four urban districts, starting with 50 this summer in the Kwun Tong and Kowloon Bay districts that were the scene of Saturday's protest march.Hong Kong's government-owned subway system operator, MTR Corp., shut down stations and suspended train service near the protest route, after attacks by Chinese state media accusing it of helping protesters flee in previous protests.MTR said Friday that it may close stations near protests under high risk or emergency situations. The company has until now kept stations open and trains running even when there have been chaotic skirmishes between protesters and police.Lau said MTR was working with the government to "suppress freedom of expression."Also Saturday, Chinese police said they released an employee at the British Consulate in Hong Kong as scheduled after 15 days of administrative detention.Simon Cheng Man-kit was detained for violating mainland Chinese law and "confessed to his illegal acts," the public security bureau in Luohu, Shenzhen, said on its Weibo microblog account, without providing further details.The Chinese government has said that Cheng, who went missing after traveling by train to mainland China for a business trip, was held for violating public order regulations in Shenzhen, in a case that further stoked tensions in Hong Kong, a former British colony.The British government confirmed his release."We welcome the release of Simon Cheng and are delighted that he can be reunited with his family," the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement, adding that Cheng and his family had requested privacy.Cheng, a Scottish government trade and investment officer, was a local employee without a diplomatic passport.The Global Times, a Communist Party-owned nationalistic tabloid, said Thursday that he was detained for "soliciting prostitutes." China often uses public order charges against political targets and has sometimes used the accusation of soliciting prostitution.___Associated Press news assistant Henry Hou in Beijing contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 25, 2019End of Document

Rose Slams Administration for Failing to Stop Illegal Importation of Fentanyl Through JFK AirportTargeted News ServiceJuly 25, 2019 Thursday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 790 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Max Rose, D-New York, issued the following news release:Congressman Max Rose chaired a hearing today to address the unprecedented opioid epidemic and urge action to stop the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United States. Rose highlighted the important role John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) plays in screening more than half of all international mail that arrives in the United States."My district has been one of the epicenters of the epidemic. I've spoken to too many mothers and fathers who have had to bury their child. So, are we seeing progress? Yes, but nowhere near enough," said Rose in his opening remarks. "I am concerned about a recent [Department of Homeland Security] Office of Inspector General report from last September which indicates DHS's Custom and Border Protection's mail inspection process needs improvement at JFK International Airport in New York City. With much of the illicit fentanyl arriving via international mail from China, this is concerning. Already, dealers on the dark web take advantage of the existing security gaps highlighted in the OIG report. They guarantee delivery of their illicit fentanyl and even offer replacing orders that do not arrive."In his questioning, Rose asked Sondra McCauley, U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Assistant Inspector General for Audits, "Ms. McCauley, you mentioned that at Kennedy Airport specifically, we're looking at 0.01 percent of mail being screened. Could we surmise that less than one percent of the fentanyl coming into the airport is seized?"McCauley responded, "I wouldn't be able to make that calculation, but I would say that, they're not screening and identifying everything."Rose confirmed with McCauley that Customs and Border Patrol's (CBP) has failed to implement or make significant progress on the recommendations made in the Inspector General report from last September detailing a number of deficiencies in CBP's inspection processes at JFK. The report detailed four main deficiencies that inhibits CBP's ability to prevent illegal drugs and contraband from entering the country, including: (1) CBP does not inspect all international mail selected for inspection; (2) CBP does not inventory all mail selected for inspection; (3) the Automated Targeting System pilot for targeting mail has limited impact, partially due to foreign governments like China not providing data on incoming mail; and, (4) CBP's chemical analysis process for detecting illegal opioids in arriving air mail is problematic."We wonder why people hate government," Rose said in response to McCauley's confirmation that CBP has failed to fully implement the recommendations. "A year--recommendations still open: K9 teams, technology, resources--and they have not shown any sense of urgency to adopt these. Is that correct?"McCauley responded, "Our teams that are on the ground now are looking into these issues. They're seeing some improvement and will be reporting out this fall.""Some improvement ... I'll make sure to pass on that next time I have to go to a funeral from someone who's overdosed from fentanyl-laced heroin," Rose concluded.Rose, a member of the Freshmen Working Group on Addiction, has made combating the opioid epidemic and raising awareness around the disease of addiction a top priority. As part of the National Defense Authorization Act, both the House and Senate passed Rose's bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act to apply pressure on the Chinese government to honor their commitment to make all fentanyl illegal and provide the United States with more tools and resources to go after illicit traffickers in China, Mexico, and other countries.Additionally, the House Committee on Homeland Security passed legislation from Rose yesterday to help crack down on the inflow of foreign fentanyl and other opioids into the United States. Following a bipartisan push by Rose to increase funding for opioid prevention and treatment efforts, the House of Representatives passed legislation that increases funding to the agency responsible for supporting these efforts by $129 million.The Center for Disease Control indicates that from 2000 to 2012, fentanyl was identified in 2 percent of all drug overdose deaths. By 2016, that number rose to 44 percent, and by 2017, 57 percent of all deaths that resulted from drug overdose had fentanyl involved. Much of the fentanyl seized in New York City is produced by Mexican cartels, which acquire chemical precursors from China, the world's largest producer of illicit fentanyl.Watch Rose's line of questioning HERE (https://youtu.be/Flu4tM_2YLY); full hearing HERE (           https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&#38;v=p4A2KHRHkY8).Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6801784 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 26, 2019End of Document

Kennedy International Airport (JFK) plays in screening more than half of all international mail that arrives in the United States."My district has been one of the epicenters of the epidemic. I've spoken to too many mothers and fathers who have had to bury their child. So, are we seeing progress? Yes, but nowhere near enough," said Rose in his opening remarks. "I am concerned about a recent [Department of Homeland Security] Office of Inspector General report from last September which indicates DHS's Custom and Border Protection's mail inspection process needs improvement at JFK International Airport in New York City. With much of the illicit fentanyl arriving via international mail from China, this is concerning. Already, dealers on the dark web take advantage of the existing security gaps highlighted in the OIG report. They guarantee delivery of their illicit fentanyl and even offer replacing orders that do not arrive."In his questioning, Rose asked Sondra McCauley, U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Assistant Inspector General for Audits, "Ms. McCauley, you mentioned that at Kennedy Airport specifically, we're looking at 0.01 percent of mail being screened. Could we surmise that less than one percent of the fentanyl coming into the airport is seized?"McCauley responded, "I wouldn't be able to make that calculation, but I would say that, they're not screening and identifying everything."Rose confirmed with McCauley that Customs and Border Patrol's (CBP) has failed to implement or make significant progress on the recommendations made in the Inspector General report from last September detailing a number of deficiencies in CBP's inspection processes at JFK. The report detailed four main deficiencies that inhibits CBP's ability to prevent illegal drugs and contraband from entering the country, including: (1) CBP does not inspect all international mail selected for inspection; (2) CBP does not inventory all mail selected for inspection; (3) the Automated Targeting System pilot for targeting mail has limited impact, partially due to foreign governments like China not providing data on incoming mail; and, (4) CBP's chemical analysis process for detecting illegal opioids in arriving air mail is problematic."We wonder why people hate government," Rose said in response to McCauley's confirmation that CBP has failed to fully implement the recommendations. "A yearrecommendations still open: K9 teams, technology, resourcesand they have not shown any sense of urgency to adopt these. Is that correct?"McCauley responded, "Our teams that are on the ground now are looking into these issues. They're seeing some improvement and will be reporting out this fall.""Some improvement ... I'll make sure to pass on that next time I have to go to a funeral from someone who's overdosed from fentanyl-laced heroin," Rose concluded.Rose, a member of the Freshmen Working Group on Addiction, has made combating the opioid epidemic and raising awareness around the disease of addiction a top priority. As part of the National Defense Authorization Act, both the House and Senate passed Rose's bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act to apply pressure on the Chinese government to honor their commitment to make all fentanyl illegal and provide the United States with more tools and resources to go after illicit traffickers in China, Mexico, and other countries.Additionally, the House Committee on Homeland Security passed legislation from Rose yesterday to help crack down on the inflow of foreign fentanyl and other opioids into the United States. Following a bipartisan push by Rose to increase funding for opioid prevention and treatment efforts, the House of Representatives passed legislation that increases funding to the agency responsible for supporting these efforts by $129 million.The Center for Disease Control indicates that from 2000 to 2012, fentanyl was identified in 2 percent of all drug overdose deaths. By 2016, that number rose to 44 percent, and by 2017, 57 percent of all deaths that resulted from drug overdose had fentanyl involved. Much of the fentanyl seized in New York City is produced by Mexican cartels, which acquire chemical precursors from China, the world's largest producer of illicit fentanyl.###Load-Date: July 25, 2019End of Document

Trump pledges probe into Google 'treason' claimPolitico.comJuly 16, 2019 Tuesday 10:15 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 492 wordsByline: clima@politico.com,  (Cristiano Lima)BodyPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration will look into tech investor Peter Thiel's accusation that Google may be committing treason through its work in China, suggesting he may urge the Justice Department to launch an investigation into the matter.Thiel, a prominent Trump supporter and Facebook board member, on Sunday accused Google of "engag[ing] in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military," according to Axios. Thiel later criticized the company's approach to China as "very peculiar" during a Monday night interview on Fox News.Trump pointed to Thiel's critiques in a tweet early Tuesday, adding, "A great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone! The Trump Administration will take a look!"The president later told reporters at the White House that he "would like to recommend to the various agencies, including perhaps our attorney general ... to maybe take a look" at what he called a "very strong charge" by Thiel."It's a big statement when you say that Google is involved with China in not a very positive way for our country," he said. "So I think we'll all look at that. I know that our other agencies will be looking at it. We'll see if there's any truth to it."The pledges came despite the president already seemingly coming away satisfied from a March meeting with Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the company's endeavors in China. After the sitdown, Trump tweeted that Pichai "stated strongly that he is totally committed to the U.S. Military, not the Chinese Military."At a Tuesday Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing convened to probe Google's search and content moderation practices, company public policy chief Karan Bhatia firmly pushed back against Thiel and Trump's assertions.Addressing questions from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Bhatia said Google has "absolutely not" found evidence of Chinese government infiltration of the company or its data; allowed considerations involving work in China to influence any decisions on U.S. government contracts; or turned a blind eye to any leaks of Google software or data to Chinese intelligence."Fundamentally in China we actually do very little today," Bhatia said later in the session, after Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) hammered the company for past efforts to do business in China.Thiel offered no explanation for his charges of treason, but his comments echoed criticism aired earlier this year by some defense officials and lawmakers. They hammered Google for pulling back on U.S. defense contracting over the last year while still pursuing business and research interests in China.Simply operating in China is tantamount to supporting the country's military, given the Chinese government's extensive surveillance capabilities and tight control over businesses in the country, the officials argued.John Hendel contributed to this report.Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: July 17, 2019End of Document

Stock Market UpdateBriefing.comJuly 30, 2019 4:21 PMCopyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 5250 wordsBodyWall Street closes slightly lower in front of Apple's (AAPL) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrowPresident Trump calls out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products; trade talks expected to wrap up tomorrow in Shanghai Consumer confidence for July climbs above expectations Wall Street ticks lower in front of possible market-moving events - Jul 30 - 16:15 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market wavered mostly in negative territory on Tuesday, leaving the S&P 500 (-0.3%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%) with slight losses. There weren't too many positive catalysts for the broader market, but the small-cap Russell 2000 did advance 1.1% to finish near session highs.  The S&P 500's worst levels of the day came shortly after the open, as investors appeared uninterested to participate in the action in front of Apple's (AAPL 208.78, -0.90, -0.4%) earnings report after the close and the FOMC's rate decision tomorrow. President Trump alleging that China has yet to buy U.S. agricultural products added to the negative tone. Still, aside from some profit taking in hot-flying stocks like Beyond Meat (BYND 194.76, -27.37, -12.3%) and Under Armour (UAA 24.08, -3.36, -12.2%) following their earnings reports, there was no serious interest to withdraw from the broader market. At its low, the S&P 500 was down 0.7% and hanging just above the 3000 level, where it would firmly stay above the rest of the day. The final standings reflected a mixed session with five S&P 500 sectors finishing higher and six sectors finishing lower. The utilities (-0.8%), information technology (-0.7%), and consumer discretionary (-0.7%) sectors underperformed, while the energy (+1.1%), real estate (+0.9%), and materials (+0.6%) sectors finished on top. Energy stocks gained traction as oil prices ($58.05, +1.18, +2.1%) made a big move in the afternoon on no confirmed news catalyst. The noticeable gain today could  have been derived from speculation that the Fed's expected rate cut tomorrow could increase demand for oil. In other corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 120.41, +4.41, +3.8%) and Merck (MRK 83.27, +0.78, +1.0%) pleased investors with their earnings results. Pfizer (PFE 38.79, -2.66) fell 6.4% after the stock was downgraded at both Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 91.21, -5.71) fell 5.9% after disclosing a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower in another muted session. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point each to 1.85% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished unchanged at 98.05.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:• Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.• The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.• The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.• Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May.Looking ahead, investors will receive the FOMC rate decision, the ADP Employment Change report for July, the Chicago PMI for July, the Employment Cost Index for the second quarter, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.• Nasdaq Composite +24.7% YTD• S&P 500 +20.2% YTD• Russell 2000 +17.6% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTDNASDAQ - 1883 - 1170 - 1.8 blnNYSE - 1728 - 1168 - 775.8 mlnDJ30 - -23.33 - 27198.02NASDAQ - -19.71 - 8273.62SP500 - -7.79 - 3013.18Oil prices rise ahead of Fed rate decision - Jul 30 - 15:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] • Metals Settlement Prices:December gold settled up $10.80 (0.8%) at $1444.10/ozSeptember silver settled up $0.165 higher (1.0%) at $16.605/ozSeptember copper settled down $0.0405 lower (0.1%) at $2.677/lb• Agriculture Settlement Prices:Sept corn settled $0.05 lower at $4.11/bushelSept wheat settled $0.06 lower at $4.97/bushelNov soybeans settled $0.07 lower at $8.96/bushel• Energy Settlement Prices:September Crude Oil futures rose $1.18 (2.1%) to $58.05/barrelSept Natural Gas rose $0.021 (0.1%) at $2.137/MMBtuSept RBOB Gasoline rose $0.0307 (0.2%) at $1.846/gallonSept Heating Oil rose $0.0323 (0.2%) at $1.9526/gallonNASDAQ - 1865 - 1163 - 1.4 blnNYSE - 1655 - 1279 - 451.8 mlnDJ30 - -42.10 - 27179.25NASDAQ - -20.65 - 8272.68SP500 - -9.63 - 3011.34Digesting the prior knee-jerk reaction - Jul 30 - 14:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] Some of the prior trade-related enthusiasm has eased a bit, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the moment.It should be noted that President Trump did not specify when he spoke with his Chinese counterpart, but it was still soothing for the market to hear. Oil prices have been on the rise, too, with crude up 2.1% to $58.08/bbl. The S&P 500 energy sector (+1.2%) is today's best-performing sector.Looking ahead, Apple (AAPL 209.61, -0.08, unch), Amgen (AMGN 175.90, -0.19, -0.1%), and Gilead Sciences (GILD 67.16, -0.71, -1.0%) are some of the more notable companies that will report their earnings after the close. NASDAQ - 1874 - 1143 - 1.3 blnNYSE - 1661 - 1264 - 417.8 mlnDJ30 - -29.91 - 27191.44NASDAQ - -13.04 - 8280.29SP500 - -7.52 - 3013.45S&P 500 Lags; Dow, Nasdaq Touch Positive Levels Briefly - Jul 30 - 14:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite touched above yesterday's close briefly in the last half hour. The S&P 500 lagged behind, though, and still trades at about 0.18% lower. The catalyst appears two fold: comments from President Donald Trump spoke to reporters in front of the White House stating he, "spoke recently with Chinese President Xi," in addition to the recent spike in crude oil futures.The worst-performing names in the S&P 500 today include Gartner (IT 138.97, -31.76, -18.60%), UnderArmour (UAA 23.97, -3.47, -12.65%), and HCA (HCA). Theses three all reported earnings in the last 24 hours, all three made multi week lows, and all three were at multi month highs heading into their respective results.Conversely, Natl Oilwell Varco (NOV 23.01, +2.33, +11.27%) sits atop the index, helped in part by today's rise in crude oil futures.NASDAQ - 1863 - 1132 - 1.20 blnNYSE - 1655 - 1256 - 393.0 mlnDJ30 - -1.75 - 27219.6NASDAQ - -4.63 - 8288.7SP500 - -5.38 - 3015.59Gold Higher Ahead Of Tomorrow's Fed Decision - Jul 30 - 14:00 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite made a session high in the last 30 minutes, now just 0.19% lower vs 0.79% at today's lows.Gold futures moved higher on Tuesday, settling higher by 0.7% to $1,430.20/oz; the yellow metal posted modest gains juxtaposed against the start of the two day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.The U.S. Dollar Index sits less than 0.1% higher to 98.09.NASDAQ - 1806 - 1197 - 1.09 blnNYSE - 1560 - 1351 - 359.0 mlnDJ30 - -46.71 - 27174.64NASDAQ - -16.15 - 8277.18SP500 - -8.46 - 3012.51Still Lower - Jul 30 - 13:35 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are little changed in the last 30 minutes; the Dow Jones Industrial Average still holds the softest declines on Tuesday, down about 0.21%.Today's losses in Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent Pfizer (PFE 38.85, -2.60, -6.27%) have been widely covered; behind PFE shares of Caterpillar (CAT 132.64, -1.82, -1.35%), Walt Disney (DIS 144.71, -1.68, -1.15%), and Intel (INTC 51.98, -0.53, -1.01%) cling to decent losses. DIS gives back a portion of yesterday's all-time highs which were tied to a strong weekend from the company's The Lion King remake, while INTC falls following a cautious sell side mention.Conversely, Boeing (BA 343.38, +3.17, +0.93%) sits near the top of the index, recovering slightly from recent losses, as it appears no bad news is essentially good news for the embattled aerospace and defense company.The DJIA gives back a portion of the recovery from the last two days, now down some 0.68% over the last calendar week.NASDAQ - 1766 - 1232 - 1.01 blnNYSE - 1504 - 1400 - 335.0 mlnDJ30 - -58.28 - 27163.07NASDAQ - -26.26 - 8267.07SP500 - -10.73 - 3010.24Stock market wavers with losses; eyes Apple and the Fed - Jul 30 - 12:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory today with the S&P 500 currently down 0.3%. There hasn't been much buying conviction in the broader market, although the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.5%) has seen some positive action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.Several factors that have contributed to the negative disposition include President Trump saying there are no signs of China buying U.S. agricultural products, some cautious trading ahead of Apple's (AAPL 208.08, -1.59, -0.8%) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrow, and the disappointing price action in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 205.01, -17.12, -7.7%) following its report. Beyond Meat is perhaps more a reflection of how far many stocks, and the stock market to a certain extent, have come in a short period of time. It isn't too surprising to see some broader consolidation -- or to see shares of Beyond Meat attempting a recovery after being down as much as 17% today. The stock market, too, has come off its lows. At this juncture, the utilities (-0.7%), information technology (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.6%) sectors are underperforming, while the materials (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.4%) sectors are outperforming. In corporate news,  Procter & Gamble (PG 121.29, +5.29, +4.6%) and Merck (MRK 83.42, +0.94, +1.1%) both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Shares are up nicely on the results, while shares of fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.02, -2.44) are down 5.9% after being downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 89.99, -6.93, -7.2%), meanwhile, is feeling the fallout from a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.Separately, an expectation that interest rates will remain low has prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its S&P 500 2019 year-end target to 3100 and set a 2020 year-end price target of 3400. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up one basis point to 2.07%. Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:• Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June.

Analyst expectations are low, but interest is high for one of the market's most widely-owned stocks that has already surged nearly 32% this year. Overseas, the major European indices closed on lower note. Germany's DAX lost 2.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.5%, and France's CAC lost 1.6%.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.3%. The Dow has received some support from shares of Procter & Gamble (PG 121.00, +5.00, +4.3%) and Merck (MRK 83.15, +0.65, +0.8%) following their earnings reports. The blue-chip average, however, is being pressured by losses in most components, including Pfizer (PFE 39.32, -2.12, -5.1%), which was downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Separately, shares of Capital One (COF 90.05, -6.87, -7.1%) are getting hit after the company announced a data breach that affected around 100 million customers in the United States and six million in Canada. The suspected hacker has been arrested. NASDAQ - 1456 - 1434 - 617.9 mlnNYSE - 1390 - 1435 - 211.7 mlnDJ30 - -24.31 - 27197.04NASDAQ - -24.51 - 8268.82SP500 - -8.12 - 3012.85Consolidation in front of Fed - Jul 30 - 10:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, recouping some of its opening losses. Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow. Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock.

Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.De-risking efforts appear to be contributing to the negative disposition, partly due to negative trade rhetoric from President Trump stirring trade concerns. Specifically, the president tweeted that there are "no signs" that China has begun to buy U.S. agricultural products. The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai. In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook. Dow components Procter &Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher. Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close. Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows. The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans. On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher. Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield  and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl. Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index.

HUAWEI TURNS TO NEVADA-BASED RADIO STATION FOR PR CAMPAIGNStates News ServiceJuly 23, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1002 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Responsive Politics:By Jessica PiperLas Vegas Public Radio Inc. will develop and air programs to advance U.S.-China relations, according to a recent lobbying disclosure. The station will also work with Huawei on a pilot project to extend American public broadcasting to China.Amid an escalating trade war with China, the Trump administration effectively banned U.S. technology companies from doing business with Huawei in May, citing national security concerns. Members of Congress and U.S. intelligence agencies have long expressed worries about the billion-dollar company's ties to the Chinese government, allegations that Huawei executives have repeatedly denied.Proponents of using Huawei equipment in the U.S. argue that the Chinese technology is less expensive, which would make it easier to expand next-generation 5G cellular networks and broadband in rural areas. Some U.S. allies, such as Germany, have allowed Huawei to operate within their borders, contingent upon the telecom's continued ability to comply with security requirements.The agreement between Huawei and Las Vegas Public Radio is designed to ameliorate fears about the tech giant's potential entry into the U.S. market. The station is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is not affiliated with Nevada Public Radio or National Public Radio.According to a lobbying disclosure signed July 19 by the station's president, Gregory LaPorta, the radio station will "address concerns that Members of Congress, Executive branch and American businesses have about Huawei products/services being developed or manufactured in the US for US consumption... via programs developed by Mr. LaPorta/LVPR and aired on KIOF 97.9 FM locally and Internet streams worldwide."Las Vegas Public Radio says it will not engage in direct lobbying advocacy on behalf of Huawei but decided to register lobbyists anyway "in the interest of transparency," according to the disclosure.Grassroots communications, such as radio programming, do not typically fall under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, said Joshua Rosenstein, an attorney with Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein and Birkenstock. Public communications on behalf of a foreign interests are generally governed by the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.Help us count cash and make change by making a donation today.Huawei occupies an unusual place under these regulations because it straddles the line between a private company and a foreign actor. Lobbyists for private companies may claim an exemption that enables them to register under LDA rather than FARA so long as they actually engage in lobbying activities and their client is not controlled or backed by a foreign government.However, Huawei's close ties to the Chinese government have raised questions as to whether FARA registration should be required. Lobbyists for Huawei have mostly registered with Congress, but two lobbying firms representing the telecom giant registered under FARA earlier this year. Those registrations came after the Department of Justice announced in March that it would increase enforcement of FARA violations in the wake of Russian meddling during the 2016 election."It is our understanding that Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. is a private, employee-owned company," wrote BCW, one of the firms lobbying on Huawei's behalf, in its FARA registration in March. "We have requested, but have not obtained, confirmation of this information from Huawei."In addition to these contracts, Huawei spent more than $200,000 lobbying the federal government during the first half of 2019.Las Vegas Public Radio's lobbying disclosure also states that Huawei will assist the radio station through a pilot project located in a Chinese city, with the goal of making American public broadcasting available in China.Station executives did not respond to OpenSecrets inquiries about the specifics of the lobbying activities and a timeline for the Huawei-related programming. The station also plays music and airs several talk shows.The Washington Post reported Monday that Huawei might have helped North Korea build a 3G wireless network, a violation of U.S.-imposed sanctions because the Chinese telecom uses some American technology. Huawei reportedly worked with a Chinese state-owned firm, Panda International Information Technology Co. Ltd., on the project. In a statement, Huawei denied having a presence in North Korea.Executives from several major tech companies, including Qualcomm and Google, also met with White House economic advisers Monday to discuss Huawei. Tech companies successfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow them to sell to Huawei earlier this month. The meeting was scheduled before the Post's North Korea story broke.Feel free to distribute or cite this material, but please credit the Center for Responsive Politics.For permission to reprint for commercial uses, such as textbooks, contact the Center: [email protected]Support Accountability JournalismAt OpenSecrets.org we offer in-depth, money-in-politics stories in the public interest.

The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, the Dow is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.1%.Today's leaders have been the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+1.6%), utilities (+1.2%), and real estate (+1.1%) sectors. Today's laggards have included the energy (-0.7%), industrials (-0.2%), and information technology (-0.2%) sectors.WTI crude futures settled 1.4% lower at $54.38/bbl, as it continued to get pressured by growth concerns and the speculation that it will lead to less end-demand.14:55 ETDow +42.13 at 25521.53, Nasdaq -20.67 at 7753.28, S&P +1.09 at 2841.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades near its flat line, while the Dow clings onto a 0.1% gain.Another look at energy shows the broader sector down 0.9%, which is good for today's worst-performance among the sectors. For the year, the S&P 500 energy sector is now down 2.8% this year versus a 13.3% gain in the S&P 500.Looking ahead, semiconductor companies Applied Materials (AMAT 46.96, +0.27, +0.6%) and NVIDIA (NVDA 148.23, -1.84, -1.2%) will report earnings results after today's closing bell.14:30 ETDow +26.28 at 25505.68, Nasdaq -24.59 at 7749.36, S&P +0.66 at 2841.26[BRIEFING.COM] In a Herculean feat of strength the major averages got taken for a ride this past half hour in which the S&P 500 at one point held losses of 0.53%, but now stands 0.06% higher. It's a head-scratcher for sure, but the decline had roots in the dip below 1.5% on the 10-year treasury yield -- a level not seen since August of 2016.The sell off, while partly treasury-based, draws partly from declines out of S&P 500 constituents Tapestry (TPR 18.80, -6.20, -24.80%), General Electric (GE 8.02, -1.01, -11.18%), and Gap (GPS 15.25, -1.28, -7.74%). TPR falls in reaction to this morning's underwhelming earnings and guidance, taking GPS lower in sympathy, while GE slips on the widely-covered critical report from "whistleblower" Harry Markopolos.Conversely, healthcare product company Agilent (A 69.81, +4.22, +6.43%) still holds on at the top of the index in part due to yesterday's Q3 beat and guidance.14:00 ETDow -123.28 at 25356.12, Nasdaq -53.26 at 7720.69, S&P -13.23 at 2827.37[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have resumed their selling in the last half hour with all three major averages getting worked over into negative territory; the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite now shows losses of 0.69%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 lower by 0.48% and 0.47% apiece.Gold futures added $3.40 (+0.2%) on Thursday to settle at $1,531.20/oz as a back and forth day turned higher at the right time.The U.S. Dollar Index sits just above 0.1% higher to 98.12.13:35 ETDow +56.61 at 25536.01, Nasdaq -4.92 at 7769.03, S&P +4.93 at 2845.53[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages still stand mixed at this point on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average pacing the advance, higher by 0.22%.Today's recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is helped along by names like Walmart (WMT 110.92, +4.72, +4.44%), Boeing (BA 326.42, +6.00, +1.87%), and Visa (V 176.05, +2.79, +1.61%). WMT's widely-covered gains today stem from this morning's results and guidance, while BA & V move higher as the general recovery in the broader markets trickles down.Conversely, technology giant Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.53, -4.08, -8.06%) still sits at the bottom of the index following last night's underwhelming guidance.Today's modest recovery in the DJIA has the index about 4.94% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +50.14 at 25529.54, Nasdaq -7.97 at 7765.98, S&P +4.42 at 2845.02[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a mixed session that has included its fair share of trade headlines, corporate news, and economic data. Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results.

There has been no meaningful attempt to rebound from yesterday's 3% sell-off.Shares of American Airlines (AAL 25.28, -0.82) have dropped 3.2% on no confirmed news catalyst today. The company, which is a part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (-0.8%), is one of many stocks within that group to trade lower.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.7%, UK's FTSE lost 1.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.3%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.3%.11:25 ETDow -9.82 at 25469.58, Nasdaq -23.94 at 7750.01, S&P -2.85 at 2837.75[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dipped back into the red. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.Weakness has come from the S&P 500 energy (-0.9%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.6%) sectors. Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices ($54.69, -0.54, -1.0%) continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a 12.4% drop in shares of General Electric (7.95, -1.08). GE has nearly doubled its losses since the last update.The tech sector has been dragged lower by shares of Apple (AAPL 200.74, -1.97, -1.0%), Microsoft (MFST 132.79, -1.18, -0.9%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.86, -3.75, -7.4%) -- the latter of which remains noticeably lower following its disappointing guidance.10:55 ETDow +66.58 at 25545.98, Nasdaq +13.34 at 7787.29, S&P +11.44 at 2852.04[BRIEFING.COM] The market has been clinging onto modest gains today, although the price action has not been very convincing. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.Overnight, the futures market was signaling more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept. 1. China did soften its stance later, saying it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks but this is a line it has been saying for quite some time now.In other earnings news, Tapestry (TPR 20.30, -4.70, -18.8%) shares have plunged nearly 20% after the company missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter and the rest of its fiscal year.10:25 ETDow +66.28 at 25545.68, Nasdaq +19.73 at 7793.68, S&P +12.09 at 2852.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%.Dow components Walmart (WMT 111.14, +4.94, +4.7%) and Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.32, -3.30, -6.5%) have been in focus today after releasing their earnings reports. Walmart provided solid quarterly results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, while Cisco Systems guided its fiscal Q1 EPS and revenue below consensus.General Electric (GE 8.42, -0.61, -6.8%) has also received plenty of attention today, with shares down nearly 7% after whistleblower Harry Markopolos labeled GE a "Bigger Fraud Than Enron" in a critical report on GE's accounting.10:00 ETDow +78.14 at 25557.54, Nasdaq +13.54 at 7787.49, S&P +9.58 at 2850.18[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Business inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%).

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sector standings shows consumer staples (+0.7%) and financials (+0.6%) providing some support for the broader market. Conversely, the energy (-0.8%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors have been influential laggards.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.55%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.99.

The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks.

China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, the Dow is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.1%.Today's leaders have been the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+1.6%), utilities (+1.2%), and real estate (+1.1%) sectors. Today's laggards have included the energy (-0.7%), industrials (-0.2%), and information technology (-0.2%) sectors.WTI crude futures settled 1.4% lower at $54.38/bbl, as it continued to get pressured by growth concerns and the speculation that it will lead to less end-demand.14:55 ETDow +42.13 at 25521.53, Nasdaq -20.67 at 7753.28, S&P +1.09 at 2841.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades near its flat line, while the Dow clings onto a 0.1% gain.Another look at energy shows the broader sector down 0.9%, which is good for today's worst-performance among the sectors. For the year, the S&P 500 energy sector is now down 2.8% this year versus a 13.3% gain in the S&P 500.Looking ahead, semiconductor companies Applied Materials (AMAT 46.96, +0.27, +0.6%) and NVIDIA (NVDA 148.23, -1.84, -1.2%) will report earnings results after today's closing bell.14:30 ETDow +26.28 at 25505.68, Nasdaq -24.59 at 7749.36, S&P +0.66 at 2841.26[BRIEFING.COM] In a Herculean feat of strength the major averages got taken for a ride this past half hour in which the S&P 500 at one point held losses of 0.53%, but now stands 0.06% higher. It's a head-scratcher for sure, but the decline had roots in the dip below 1.5% on the 10-year treasury yield -- a level not seen since August of 2016.The sell off, while partly treasury-based, draws partly from declines out of S&P 500 constituents Tapestry (TPR 18.80, -6.20, -24.80%), General Electric (GE 8.02, -1.01, -11.18%), and Gap (GPS 15.25, -1.28, -7.74%). TPR falls in reaction to this morning's underwhelming earnings and guidance, taking GPS lower in sympathy, while GE slips on the widely-covered critical report from "whistleblower" Harry Markopolos.Conversely, healthcare product company Agilent (A 69.81, +4.22, +6.43%) still holds on at the top of the index in part due to yesterday's Q3 beat and guidance.14:00 ETDow -123.28 at 25356.12, Nasdaq -53.26 at 7720.69, S&P -13.23 at 2827.37[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have resumed their selling in the last half hour with all three major averages getting worked over into negative territory; the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite now shows losses of 0.69%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 lower by 0.48% and 0.47% apiece.Gold futures added $3.40 (+0.2%) on Thursday to settle at $1,531.20/oz as a back and forth day turned higher at the right time.The U.S. Dollar Index sits just above 0.1% higher to 98.12.13:35 ETDow +56.61 at 25536.01, Nasdaq -4.92 at 7769.03, S&P +4.93 at 2845.53[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages still stand mixed at this point on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average pacing the advance, higher by 0.22%.Today's recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is helped along by names like Walmart (WMT 110.92, +4.72, +4.44%), Boeing (BA 326.42, +6.00, +1.87%), and Visa (V 176.05, +2.79, +1.61%). WMT's widely-covered gains today stem from this morning's results and guidance, while BA & V move higher as the general recovery in the broader markets trickles down.Conversely, technology giant Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.53, -4.08, -8.06%) still sits at the bottom of the index following last night's underwhelming guidance.Today's modest recovery in the DJIA has the index about 4.94% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +50.14 at 25529.54, Nasdaq -7.97 at 7765.98, S&P +4.42 at 2845.02[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a mixed session that has included its fair share of trade headlines, corporate news, and economic data. Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Facebook (FB 182.21, +2.50, +1.4%), Amazon (AMZN 1776.96, +14.27, +0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1171.68, +7.39, +0.6%) trade higher, while Apple (AAPL 202.08, -0.67, -0.3%) and Netflix (NFLX 294.21, -4.90, -1.7%) trade lower.Elswhere, the rally in gold has shown no signs of slowing down. The yellow metal is currently up 0.2% to $1531.20/oz.11:55 ETDow +28.87 at 25508.27, Nasdaq -12.97 at 7760.98, S&P +3.45 at 2844.05[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1% in an uninspiring session. There has been no meaningful attempt to rebound from yesterday's 3% sell-off.Shares of American Airlines (AAL 25.28, -0.82) have dropped 3.2% on no confirmed news catalyst today. The company, which is a part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (-0.8%), is one of many stocks within that group to trade lower.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.7%, UK's FTSE lost 1.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.3%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.3%.11:25 ETDow -9.82 at 25469.58, Nasdaq -23.94 at 7750.01, S&P -2.85 at 2837.75[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dipped back into the red. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.Weakness has come from the S&P 500 energy (-0.9%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.6%) sectors. Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices ($54.69, -0.54, -1.0%) continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a 12.4% drop in shares of General Electric (7.95, -1.08). GE has nearly doubled its losses since the last update.The tech sector has been dragged lower by shares of Apple (AAPL 200.74, -1.97, -1.0%), Microsoft (MFST 132.79, -1.18, -0.9%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.86, -3.75, -7.4%) -- the latter of which remains noticeably lower following its disappointing guidance.10:55 ETDow +66.58 at 25545.98, Nasdaq +13.34 at 7787.29, S&P +11.44 at 2852.04[BRIEFING.COM] The market has been clinging onto modest gains today, although the price action has not been very convincing. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.Overnight, the futures market was signaling more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept. 1. China did soften its stance later, saying it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks but this is a line it has been saying for quite some time now.In other earnings news, Tapestry (TPR 20.30, -4.70, -18.8%) shares have plunged nearly 20% after the company missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter and the rest of its fiscal year.10:25 ETDow +66.28 at 25545.68, Nasdaq +19.73 at 7793.68, S&P +12.09 at 2852.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%.Dow components Walmart (WMT 111.14, +4.94, +4.7%) and Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.32, -3.30, -6.5%) have been in focus today after releasing their earnings reports. Walmart provided solid quarterly results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, while Cisco Systems guided its fiscal Q1 EPS and revenue below consensus.General Electric (GE 8.42, -0.61, -6.8%) has also received plenty of attention today, with shares down nearly 7% after whistleblower Harry Markopolos labeled GE a "Bigger Fraud Than Enron" in a critical report on GE's accounting.10:00 ETDow +78.14 at 25557.54, Nasdaq +13.54 at 7787.49, S&P +9.58 at 2850.18[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Business inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%). The May reading was unrevised at 0.3%.Earlier, industrial production for July declined 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) following an revised increase of 0.2% in June (from 0.0%). Capacity utilization decreased to 77.5% in July (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from 77.8% in June (revised from 77.9%).09:45 ETDow -39.74 at 25439.66, Nasdaq -28.99 at 7744.96, S&P -5.45 at 2835.15[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower after their worst performance of the year yesterday. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sector standings shows consumer staples (+0.7%) and financials (+0.6%) providing some support for the broader market. Conversely, the energy (-0.8%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors have been influential laggards.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.55%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.99. WTI crude is down 1.6% to $54.34/bbl.09:13 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +43.80.The stock market is on pace to open higher following positive results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 113.24, +7.04, +6.6%) and encouraging economic data. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.58%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.94.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +16.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +39.30.The S&P 500 futures trade 16 points, or 0.6%, above fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday on a mixed note. The People's Bank of China fixed the yuan at a slightly higher level for the second day in a row. South China Morning Post quoted a Chinese government adviser as saying that protest in Hong Kong do not warrant direct intervention yet due to a high risk of damaging international relations. Australia reported better than expected employment figures for July, but expectations for more rate cuts remain in place.In economic data: China's July House Prices +9.7% yr/yr (last 10.3%) Japan's June Industrial Production -3.3% m/m (expected -3.6%; last -3.6%) and Capacity Utilization -2.6% m/m (expected 0.2%; last 1.7%) Australia's July Employment Change 41,100 (expected 14,000; last 500) and Full Employment Change 34,500 (last 21,100).

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +23.30.The S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session. Futures were pulled lower after China threatened to retaliate against the upcoming 10% tariff rate on Chinese imports, but solid results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 112.71, +6.51, +6.1%) has lifted futures back into positive territory.The market is presumably trying to find its footing after a sharp 3% sell-off yesterday that was attributed to recessionary fears. China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, the Dow is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.1%.Today's leaders have been the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+1.6%), utilities (+1.2%), and real estate (+1.1%) sectors. Today's laggards have included the energy (-0.7%), industrials (-0.2%), and information technology (-0.2%) sectors.WTI crude futures settled 1.4% lower at $54.38/bbl, as it continued to get pressured by growth concerns and the speculation that it will lead to less end-demand.14:55 ETDow +42.13 at 25521.53, Nasdaq -20.67 at 7753.28, S&P +1.09 at 2841.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades near its flat line, while the Dow clings onto a 0.1% gain.Another look at energy shows the broader sector down 0.9%, which is good for today's worst-performance among the sectors. For the year, the S&P 500 energy sector is now down 2.8% this year versus a 13.3% gain in the S&P 500.Looking ahead, semiconductor companies Applied Materials (AMAT 46.96, +0.27, +0.6%) and NVIDIA (NVDA 148.23, -1.84, -1.2%) will report earnings results after today's closing bell.14:30 ETDow +26.28 at 25505.68, Nasdaq -24.59 at 7749.36, S&P +0.66 at 2841.26[BRIEFING.COM] In a Herculean feat of strength the major averages got taken for a ride this past half hour in which the S&P 500 at one point held losses of 0.53%, but now stands 0.06% higher. It's a head-scratcher for sure, but the decline had roots in the dip below 1.5% on the 10-year treasury yield -- a level not seen since August of 2016.The sell off, while partly treasury-based, draws partly from declines out of S&P 500 constituents Tapestry (TPR 18.80, -6.20, -24.80%), General Electric (GE 8.02, -1.01, -11.18%), and Gap (GPS 15.25, -1.28, -7.74%). TPR falls in reaction to this morning's underwhelming earnings and guidance, taking GPS lower in sympathy, while GE slips on the widely-covered critical report from "whistleblower" Harry Markopolos.Conversely, healthcare product company Agilent (A 69.81, +4.22, +6.43%) still holds on at the top of the index in part due to yesterday's Q3 beat and guidance.14:00 ETDow -123.28 at 25356.12, Nasdaq -53.26 at 7720.69, S&P -13.23 at 2827.37[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have resumed their selling in the last half hour with all three major averages getting worked over into negative territory; the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite now shows losses of 0.69%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 lower by 0.48% and 0.47% apiece.Gold futures added $3.40 (+0.2%) on Thursday to settle at $1,531.20/oz as a back and forth day turned higher at the right time.The U.S. Dollar Index sits just above 0.1% higher to 98.12.13:35 ETDow +56.61 at 25536.01, Nasdaq -4.92 at 7769.03, S&P +4.93 at 2845.53[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages still stand mixed at this point on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average pacing the advance, higher by 0.22%.Today's recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is helped along by names like Walmart (WMT 110.92, +4.72, +4.44%), Boeing (BA 326.42, +6.00, +1.87%), and Visa (V 176.05, +2.79, +1.61%). WMT's widely-covered gains today stem from this morning's results and guidance, while BA & V move higher as the general recovery in the broader markets trickles down.Conversely, technology giant Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.53, -4.08, -8.06%) still sits at the bottom of the index following last night's underwhelming guidance.Today's modest recovery in the DJIA has the index about 4.94% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +50.14 at 25529.54, Nasdaq -7.97 at 7765.98, S&P +4.42 at 2845.02[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a mixed session that has included its fair share of trade headlines, corporate news, and economic data. Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Facebook (FB 182.21, +2.50, +1.4%), Amazon (AMZN 1776.96, +14.27, +0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1171.68, +7.39, +0.6%) trade higher, while Apple (AAPL 202.08, -0.67, -0.3%) and Netflix (NFLX 294.21, -4.90, -1.7%) trade lower.Elswhere, the rally in gold has shown no signs of slowing down. The yellow metal is currently up 0.2% to $1531.20/oz.11:55 ETDow +28.87 at 25508.27, Nasdaq -12.97 at 7760.98, S&P +3.45 at 2844.05[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1% in an uninspiring session. There has been no meaningful attempt to rebound from yesterday's 3% sell-off.Shares of American Airlines (AAL 25.28, -0.82) have dropped 3.2% on no confirmed news catalyst today. The company, which is a part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (-0.8%), is one of many stocks within that group to trade lower.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.7%, UK's FTSE lost 1.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.3%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.3%.11:25 ETDow -9.82 at 25469.58, Nasdaq -23.94 at 7750.01, S&P -2.85 at 2837.75[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dipped back into the red. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.Weakness has come from the S&P 500 energy (-0.9%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.6%) sectors. Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices ($54.69, -0.54, -1.0%) continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a 12.4% drop in shares of General Electric (7.95, -1.08). GE has nearly doubled its losses since the last update.The tech sector has been dragged lower by shares of Apple (AAPL 200.74, -1.97, -1.0%), Microsoft (MFST 132.79, -1.18, -0.9%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.86, -3.75, -7.4%) -- the latter of which remains noticeably lower following its disappointing guidance.10:55 ETDow +66.58 at 25545.98, Nasdaq +13.34 at 7787.29, S&P +11.44 at 2852.04[BRIEFING.COM] The market has been clinging onto modest gains today, although the price action has not been very convincing. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.Overnight, the futures market was signaling more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept. 1. China did soften its stance later, saying it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks but this is a line it has been saying for quite some time now.In other earnings news, Tapestry (TPR 20.30, -4.70, -18.8%) shares have plunged nearly 20% after the company missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter and the rest of its fiscal year.10:25 ETDow +66.28 at 25545.68, Nasdaq +19.73 at 7793.68, S&P +12.09 at 2852.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%.Dow components Walmart (WMT 111.14, +4.94, +4.7%) and Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.32, -3.30, -6.5%) have been in focus today after releasing their earnings reports. Walmart provided solid quarterly results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, while Cisco Systems guided its fiscal Q1 EPS and revenue below consensus.General Electric (GE 8.42, -0.61, -6.8%) has also received plenty of attention today, with shares down nearly 7% after whistleblower Harry Markopolos labeled GE a "Bigger Fraud Than Enron" in a critical report on GE's accounting.10:00 ETDow +78.14 at 25557.54, Nasdaq +13.54 at 7787.49, S&P +9.58 at 2850.18[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Business inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%). The May reading was unrevised at 0.3%.Earlier, industrial production for July declined 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) following an revised increase of 0.2% in June (from 0.0%). Capacity utilization decreased to 77.5% in July (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from 77.8% in June (revised from 77.9%).09:45 ETDow -39.74 at 25439.66, Nasdaq -28.99 at 7744.96, S&P -5.45 at 2835.15[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower after their worst performance of the year yesterday. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sector standings shows consumer staples (+0.7%) and financials (+0.6%) providing some support for the broader market. Conversely, the energy (-0.8%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors have been influential laggards.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.55%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.99. WTI crude is down 1.6% to $54.34/bbl.09:13 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +43.80.The stock market is on pace to open higher following positive results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 113.24, +7.04, +6.6%) and encouraging economic data. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.58%.

Futures were pulled lower after China threatened to retaliate against the upcoming 10% tariff rate on Chinese imports, but solid results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 112.71, +6.51, +6.1%) has lifted futures back into positive territory.The market is presumably trying to find its footing after a sharp 3% sell-off yesterday that was attributed to recessionary fears. China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, the Dow is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.1%.Today's leaders have been the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+1.6%), utilities (+1.2%), and real estate (+1.1%) sectors. Today's laggards have included the energy (-0.7%), industrials (-0.2%), and information technology (-0.2%) sectors.WTI crude futures settled 1.4% lower at $54.38/bbl, as it continued to get pressured by growth concerns and the speculation that it will lead to less end-demand.14:55 ETDow +42.13 at 25521.53, Nasdaq -20.67 at 7753.28, S&P +1.09 at 2841.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades near its flat line, while the Dow clings onto a 0.1% gain.Another look at energy shows the broader sector down 0.9%, which is good for today's worst-performance among the sectors. For the year, the S&P 500 energy sector is now down 2.8% this year versus a 13.3% gain in the S&P 500.Looking ahead, semiconductor companies Applied Materials (AMAT 46.96, +0.27, +0.6%) and NVIDIA (NVDA 148.23, -1.84, -1.2%) will report earnings results after today's closing bell.14:30 ETDow +26.28 at 25505.68, Nasdaq -24.59 at 7749.36, S&P +0.66 at 2841.26[BRIEFING.COM] In a Herculean feat of strength the major averages got taken for a ride this past half hour in which the S&P 500 at one point held losses of 0.53%, but now stands 0.06% higher. It's a head-scratcher for sure, but the decline had roots in the dip below 1.5% on the 10-year treasury yield -- a level not seen since August of 2016.The sell off, while partly treasury-based, draws partly from declines out of S&P 500 constituents Tapestry (TPR 18.80, -6.20, -24.80%), General Electric (GE 8.02, -1.01, -11.18%), and Gap (GPS 15.25, -1.28, -7.74%). TPR falls in reaction to this morning's underwhelming earnings and guidance, taking GPS lower in sympathy, while GE slips on the widely-covered critical report from "whistleblower" Harry Markopolos.Conversely, healthcare product company Agilent (A 69.81, +4.22, +6.43%) still holds on at the top of the index in part due to yesterday's Q3 beat and guidance.14:00 ETDow -123.28 at 25356.12, Nasdaq -53.26 at 7720.69, S&P -13.23 at 2827.37[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have resumed their selling in the last half hour with all three major averages getting worked over into negative territory; the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite now shows losses of 0.69%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 lower by 0.48% and 0.47% apiece.Gold futures added $3.40 (+0.2%) on Thursday to settle at $1,531.20/oz as a back and forth day turned higher at the right time.The U.S. Dollar Index sits just above 0.1% higher to 98.12.13:35 ETDow +56.61 at 25536.01, Nasdaq -4.92 at 7769.03, S&P +4.93 at 2845.53[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages still stand mixed at this point on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average pacing the advance, higher by 0.22%.Today's recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is helped along by names like Walmart (WMT 110.92, +4.72, +4.44%), Boeing (BA 326.42, +6.00, +1.87%), and Visa (V 176.05, +2.79, +1.61%). WMT's widely-covered gains today stem from this morning's results and guidance, while BA & V move higher as the general recovery in the broader markets trickles down.Conversely, technology giant Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.53, -4.08, -8.06%) still sits at the bottom of the index following last night's underwhelming guidance.Today's modest recovery in the DJIA has the index about 4.94% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +50.14 at 25529.54, Nasdaq -7.97 at 7765.98, S&P +4.42 at 2845.02[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a mixed session that has included its fair share of trade headlines, corporate news, and economic data. Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Facebook (FB 182.21, +2.50, +1.4%), Amazon (AMZN 1776.96, +14.27, +0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1171.68, +7.39, +0.6%) trade higher, while Apple (AAPL 202.08, -0.67, -0.3%) and Netflix (NFLX 294.21, -4.90, -1.7%) trade lower.Elswhere, the rally in gold has shown no signs of slowing down. The yellow metal is currently up 0.2% to $1531.20/oz.11:55 ETDow +28.87 at 25508.27, Nasdaq -12.97 at 7760.98, S&P +3.45 at 2844.05[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1% in an uninspiring session. There has been no meaningful attempt to rebound from yesterday's 3% sell-off.Shares of American Airlines (AAL 25.28, -0.82) have dropped 3.2% on no confirmed news catalyst today. The company, which is a part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (-0.8%), is one of many stocks within that group to trade lower.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.7%, UK's FTSE lost 1.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.3%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.3%.11:25 ETDow -9.82 at 25469.58, Nasdaq -23.94 at 7750.01, S&P -2.85 at 2837.75[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dipped back into the red. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.Weakness has come from the S&P 500 energy (-0.9%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.6%) sectors. Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices ($54.69, -0.54, -1.0%) continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a 12.4% drop in shares of General Electric (7.95, -1.08). GE has nearly doubled its losses since the last update.The tech sector has been dragged lower by shares of Apple (AAPL 200.74, -1.97, -1.0%), Microsoft (MFST 132.79, -1.18, -0.9%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.86, -3.75, -7.4%) -- the latter of which remains noticeably lower following its disappointing guidance.10:55 ETDow +66.58 at 25545.98, Nasdaq +13.34 at 7787.29, S&P +11.44 at 2852.04[BRIEFING.COM] The market has been clinging onto modest gains today, although the price action has not been very convincing. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.Overnight, the futures market was signaling more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept. 1. China did soften its stance later, saying it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks but this is a line it has been saying for quite some time now.In other earnings news, Tapestry (TPR 20.30, -4.70, -18.8%) shares have plunged nearly 20% after the company missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter and the rest of its fiscal year.10:25 ETDow +66.28 at 25545.68, Nasdaq +19.73 at 7793.68, S&P +12.09 at 2852.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%.Dow components Walmart (WMT 111.14, +4.94, +4.7%) and Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.32, -3.30, -6.5%) have been in focus today after releasing their earnings reports. Walmart provided solid quarterly results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, while Cisco Systems guided its fiscal Q1 EPS and revenue below consensus.General Electric (GE 8.42, -0.61, -6.8%) has also received plenty of attention today, with shares down nearly 7% after whistleblower Harry Markopolos labeled GE a "Bigger Fraud Than Enron" in a critical report on GE's accounting.10:00 ETDow +78.14 at 25557.54, Nasdaq +13.54 at 7787.49, S&P +9.58 at 2850.18[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Business inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%). The May reading was unrevised at 0.3%.Earlier, industrial production for July declined 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) following an revised increase of 0.2% in June (from 0.0%). Capacity utilization decreased to 77.5% in July (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from 77.8% in June (revised from 77.9%).09:45 ETDow -39.74 at 25439.66, Nasdaq -28.99 at 7744.96, S&P -5.45 at 2835.15[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower after their worst performance of the year yesterday. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sector standings shows consumer staples (+0.7%) and financials (+0.6%) providing some support for the broader market. Conversely, the energy (-0.8%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors have been influential laggards.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.55%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.99.

The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

Global and China's Integrated Circuit Industries Research Report, 2019 to 2023 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJuly 19, 2019 Friday 2:56 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 803 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Research Report on Global and China's Integrated Circuit Industries, 2019 to 2023" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.In 2018, the revenue of the global integrated circuit industry totaled about USD 480 billion, representing a CAGR of less than 10% from 2014 to 2018; the revenue of China's integrated circuit industry was about USD 98.70 billion, representing a CAGR of about 25% from 2014 to 2018. In China, the revenue from integrated circuit designing was about USD 38.07 billion, accounting for 38.60% of the revenue of the integrated circuit industry; the revenue from integrated circuit manufacturing was about USD 27.48 billion, accounting for about 27.80%; the revenue from integrated circuit packaging and testing was about USD 33.15 billion, accounting for 33.60%.The growth of China's integrated circuit market in recent years is mainly driven by automotive electronics, industrial automation, Internet of Things (IoT), communication equipment, etc. Global personal computer production is declining while smartphone production still has space for further expansion. The development of cloud computing, IoT, big data, 5G, and other relevant industries boost the demand for integrated circuits.China is the world's largest foundry, automobile producer and consumer and electronics manufacturing base. It is expected that for a long time in the future, China will remain the world's largest integrated circuit consumer, and the market size of integrated circuits in China will continue to grow. In 2018, the production volume of automobiles in China decreased to 27.81 million units by 4.20% YOY while that of new energy vehicles (electric vehicles) increased to 1.27 million units by about 60% YOY.A new energy vehicle has a far greater demand for integrated circuits than a fuel vehicle. With the rapidly expanding production of new energy vehicles, the automotive industry has become a major driving force for the growth of China's integrated circuit market. In 2018, the production volumes of smartphones and personal computers in China reached more than 1.30 billion units and about 300 million units respectively, both ranking the first in the world.As labor costs keep rising in recent years, it is indispensable for China to enhance automation in manufacturing. The growing demand for industrial automation equipment such as CNC machine tools and industrial robots increases the demand for integrated circuits.In the context of wider IT applications and booming IoT, China has an increasing demand for smart cities, smart logistics and industrial monitoring. According to the author, the market size of IoT in China exceeded CNY 1 trillion in 2018, which means that the demand for integrated circuits on China's IoT market is also rising rapidly.Topics covered:• Status of global integrated circuit industry• Chinese government's supportive policies on the integrated circuit industry• Supply of integrated circuits• Market demand for integrated circuits• Major integrated circuit enterprises in China• Analysis of import and export of integrated circuits in China• Threats and challenges to the integrated circuit industry• Prospect of the integrated circuit industry from 2019 to 2023• Impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war on the integrated circuit industryCompanies Mentioned• Amkor Assembly & Test (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.• Beijing Smartchip Microelectronics Technology Company Limited• China Resources Microelectronics Limited• Diodes Shanghai Co., Ltd.• Duntai Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd.• GalaxyCore Shanghai Limited• Hangzhou Silan Microelectronics Co., Ltd.• Hejian Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd.• HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd.• Hitech Semiconductor (Wuxi) Co., Ltd.• Huada Semiconductor Co., Ltd.• Intel Products (Chengdu) Ltd.• Intel Semiconductor (Dalian) Ltd.• Jiangsu Xinchao Technology Group Co., Ltd.• Nantong Huada Microelectronics Group Co., Ltd.• NXP Semiconductors• RF Micro Devices (Beijing) Co., Ltd.• Samsung (China) Semiconductor Co., Ltd.• SanDisk Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.• Sanechips Technology Co., Ltd.• Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation• Shanghai Huahong (Group) Co., Ltd.• Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co., Ltd.• SK hynix Semiconductor (China) Ltd.• Tianshui Huatian Electronics Group Co., Ltd.• TSMC China Company Limited• Unisoc Technologies Inc.• Vimicro Corporation• Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd.• Xi'an Microelectronics Technology InstituteFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/a0e8ppView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190719005284/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Press Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900Related Topics: Semiconductorhttp://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: July 20, 2019End of Document

Security concerns threaten undersea cable to ChinaStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeAugust 31, 2019 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 372 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyUS officials are moving to block the undersea cable backed by Google, Facebook and a Chinese partner, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.The multiagency panel led by the Department of Justice, known as Team Telecom, is objecting to the massive cable project, which hopes to provide faster internet to both the U.S. and China, The Journal said.A temporary permit has allowed the work to be carried out thus far.Peng did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.Underwater across the Pacific Ocean, there's something being built called the Pacific Light Cable Network that connects Los Angeles to Hong Kong. However, people familiar with the review say it is in danger of failing to win the necessary licence to conduct business because of the objections coming from the panel, known as Team Telecom.Supporters of the cable believe that approval from Team Telecom would ensure maximum security, as the US Federal Communications Commission could implement more stringent security measures for the companies involved.Smalling completes loan move to RomaFor now, the Chilean's future at Manchester United hangs in the balance, and his proposed move to Inter Milan could be off. Manchester United winger Alexis Sanchez has finally landed in Milan ahead of his proposed loan switch to Inter Milan .Team Telecom's concerns over Pacific Light include Dr. Peng's Chinese-government ties and the declining autonomy of Hong Kong.If the United States is successful in its push, it would mark the first time that Washington has invoked national security grounds in blocking the completion of an undersea cable - something that could indicate a sizable shift in US regulatory policies. Dr. Peng is China's fourth-biggest telecom operator. Google and Facebook have spent the past decade funding similar cables to handle ever-growing network traffic between the United States and Asia.Linking the U.S. mainland to Hong Kong could also give USA companies greater access to other growing markets in Asia, such as the Philippines and Malaysia.The US Department of Justice, is leading a multiagency panel on the subsea cable network.It promises "faster connections for its investors on both sides of the Pacific", the Journal reports.Load-Date: August 31, 2019End of Document

The Dow and S&P 500 each surged 1.6%. The Nasdaq bolted 2.2% higher in the first 30 minutes of trade.  The office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced it had cut the number of goods against which new tariffs would take hold in September. It also announced tariff delays on items including cell phones, laptops, video gam consoles and some clothing goods. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit the .)Apple responded by powering up more than 5% to lead the Dow. Caterpillar also gained 4%, while Walgreens Boots Alliance and Goldman Sachs gained better than 2% apiece.Among China-based companies reporting earnings, JD.com sailed 8% higher, while Tencent Music Entertainment trimmed its early loss to 1.3%, after reporting second-quarter results.That put JD.com at the top of the Nasdaq 100. Argentina's MercadoLibre was also near the top of the list, rebounding 4.4% after taking a 9.6% dive and triggering a sell rule on Monday.Tariff exposed vcompanies led the S&P 500's rally. Toymaker Mattel spiked 9% to the top of the index. Retail names crowded the top of the list, with Best Buy, Dollar Tree and Gap posed gains between 6% and 8%.Advanced Auto Parts narrowed a deep early loss to less than 2%, after reporting flat same-store-sales growth and revenue just below the consensus target.

Those gains slightly edged out consensus projections. So did the core prices, minus food and energy, which jumped 2.2% year-over-year. Economists had projected a 2.1% increase.Asia Dives After A Bad Day In ArgentinaMarkets across Asia veered lower Tuesday, as concern of Chinese government intervention in Hong Kong increased and as the city's airport shutdown stretched into a second day. The meltdown of Argentina's market after an upset preliminary presidential election also rippled across global markets, after .Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index stripped off a 2.1% loss. The Shanghai Composite sloughed off 0.6%. In Japan, Tokyo's market reopened after a three-day weekend, with the Nikkei 225 ending down 1.1%. India's Sensex dived 1.7%.In Europe, investors fought to contain losses. Frankfurt's DAX led the downside, off 0.8% just after midday. The CAC-40 in Paris and London's FTSE 100 each dropped 0.4%.Gold Prices Hit New 6-Year HighSafe haven bets continued Tuesday, with the yen outpacing gains in the dollar, while silver and gold prices rallied. Safe havens are seen as less risky, and to which investors gravitate as markets turn volatile. Gold prices gained 0.9% higher to $1530 an ounce — their highest level since April 2013. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF gained 0.6% in premarket trade. It is up 7.1% so far in August, .Bonds steadied, then pulled back from recent gains after the Consumer Prices Index release.

The drugmaker is due to report its fiscal Q4 results after the closing bell. The stock is set up in an .Dow Jones Index: Range Bound?The Dow Jones index, as well as the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, have all deflected lower for two sessions after meeting resistance at their 50-day moving averages. This sets up a situation where the term "range bound" may come in to use, as analysts describe a market that investors are attempting to drive higher, while limiting factors — such as trade war uncertainties and politic turmoil — keep a lid on the market's progress. In this case, the "range" appears to be between the leading benchmark's 200-day moving average on the low side, with the 50-day line as a ceiling.It can be difficult to get a clear reading on market behavior in August, when trading is traditionally light as investors shut down computers for the last few weeks of summer. Volume is likely to rise heading into September, with markets potentially becoming more decisive — up or down — as traders return and as the U.S. imposes its new round of tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods on Sept. 1., but with its rally attempt begun on Aug. 5 still in play.  and launch a confirmed uptrend, which could possibly launch the S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones index past resistance at their 50-day lines.For more detailed analysis of the current stock market and its status, .Oil Prices WobbleOil prices traded up and down Tuesday morning, aiming to add a three-day climb. West Texas Intermediate slipped 0.2% $54.83 a barrel Tuesday. Europe's Brent crude benchmark was flat at $58.55.WTI had dived nearly 5% to last Wednesday to its lowest mark since early January. Prices rebounded after Bloomberg reported that Saudi Arabia was considering action to support oil prices. And pipelines due to come online over the next several weeks are expected to ease some bottlenecks out of the Permian Basin, and potentially narrow the spread between U.S. WTI oil and Brent crude.On the technical side, oil prices have been struggling with resistance at its converged 10- and 40-week moving averages since early June.

House Passes Rep. Omar's Amendment for Accountability on Foreign Countries' Access to Terror Screening DatabaseTargeted News ServiceJuly 17, 2019 Wednesday 7:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 434 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, issued the following news release:The House passed an amendment to H.R. 3494, the Intelligence Authorization Act authored by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) regarding the Terrorist Screening Database. The Terrorist Screening Database (TSBD) or the "terror watchlist" is currently being shared with multiple foreign governments, including countries with appalling human rights records. The standard for adding people to the list is very low, and the vast majority of people on the list have never been charged with any crime. Moreover, according to the sworn testimony of one FBI official, a foreign government's human rights record is not considered as part of the decision to share information with them."As members of Congress, we need know which countries receive sensitive information about American citizens," said Rep. Omar. "Many of the Americans on this list have never been convicted of a crime and have not been able to remove their names from the list. It is unacceptable to share the database with foreign countries that have a record of violating human rights, like China and Saudi Arabia.Even more disturbing is that foreign governments are apparently able to add individuals to the watchlist. Among the most egregious examples of this is that there are credible accusations that Uyghur-Americans have been added at the behest of China. While Washington is united in bipartisan outrage at the precursors to genocide taking place in Xinjiang, our government lets the Chinese government target individuals from that same ethnic group in the name of fighting terrorism. This is a violation of fundamental principles of civil liberties and human rights."This amendment will require the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress on the terrorist screening database within 180 days.The report must include:A list of foreign countries that have access to the database.List of foreign countries that have successfully petitioned to add individuals to the database.The standards used to determine whether to give a foreign country access to the database.Whether a country's human rights record is considered as part of the decision to give it access to the database.What procedures exist to remove a foreign country's access to the database.What procedures exist to inform an individual or their legal counsel that they have been placed on the database.You can read the full bill here (https://omar.house.gov/sites/omar.house.gov/files/documents/OMARMN_055_xml71519115206526.pdf).Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6792275 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 18, 2019End of Document

He has kidney and heart diseases, and tumors on his chest and stomach for which he has been denied treatment while in custody, Huang's lawyers told CPJ in 2017."Huang Qi's long prison sentence is an outrageous injustice," said Steven Butler, CPJ's Asia program coordinator, in Washington, D.C. "China is incarcerating a man suffering from serious health issues whose only crime has been to expose human rights abuses by the Chinese government."The sentencing came after months of secret proceedings without lawyers present, according to a volunteer at 64 Tianwang whose name CPJ is withholding for fear they might face retaliation.Since Huang was arrested, authorities have disbarred two of his lawyers, Sui Muqing and Liu Zhengqing, and Huang dismissed another lawyer, Li Jinglin, out of concern for the lawyer's safety, according to news reports and CPJ research.

Oil prices have been on the rise, too, with crude up 2.1% to $58.08/bbl. The S&P 500 energy sector (+1.2%) is today's best-performing sector.Looking ahead, Apple (AAPL 209.61, -0.08, unch), Amgen (AMGN 175.90, -0.19, -0.1%), and Gilead Sciences (GILD 67.16, -0.71, -1.0%) are some of the more notable companies that will report their earnings after the close.14:30 ETDow -1.75 at 27219.6, Nasdaq -4.63 at 8288.7, S&P -5.38 at 3015.59[BRIEFING.COM] The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite touched above yesterday's close briefly in the last half hour. The S&P 500 lagged behind, though, and still trades at about 0.18% lower. The catalyst appears two fold: comments from President Donald Trump spoke to reporters in front of the White House stating he, "spoke recently with Chinese President Xi," in addition to the recent spike in crude oil futures.The worst-performing names in the S&P 500 today include Gartner (IT 138.97, -31.76, -18.60%), Under Armour (UAA 23.97, -3.47, -12.65%), and HCA (HCA). Theses three all reported earnings in the last 24 hours, all three made multi week lows, and all three were at multi month highs heading into their respective results.Conversely, Natl Oilwell Varco (NOV 23.01, +2.33, +11.27%) sits atop the index, helped in part by today's rise in crude oil futures.14:00 ETDow -46.71 at 27174.64, Nasdaq -16.15 at 8277.18, S&P -8.46 at 3012.51[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite made a session high in the last 30 minutes, now just 0.19% lower vs 0.79% at today's lows.Gold futures moved higher on Tuesday, settling higher by 0.7% to $1,430.20/oz; the yellow metal posted modest gains juxtaposed against the start of the two day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.The U.S. Dollar Index sits less than 0.1% higher to 98.09.13:35 ETDow -58.28 at 27163.07, Nasdaq -26.26 at 8267.07, S&P -10.73 at 3010.24[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are little changed in the last 30 minutes; the Dow Jones Industrial Average still holds the softest declines on Tuesday, down about 0.21%.Today's losses in Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent Pfizer (PFE 38.85, -2.60, -6.27%) have been widely covered; behind PFE shares of Caterpillar (CAT 132.64, -1.82, -1.35%), Walt Disney (DIS 144.71, -1.68, -1.15%), and Intel (INTC 51.98, -0.53, -1.01%) cling to decent losses. DIS gives back a portion of yesterday's all-time highs which were tied to a strong weekend from the company's The Lion King remake, while INTC falls following a cautious sell side mention.Conversely, Boeing (BA 343.38, +3.17, +0.93%) sits near the top of the index, recovering slightly from recent losses, as it appears no bad news is essentially good news for the embattled aerospace and defense company.The DJIA gives back a portion of the recovery from the last two days, now down some 0.68% over the last calendar week.12:55 ETDow -56.49 at 27164.86, Nasdaq -30.01 at 8263.32, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory today with the S&P 500 currently down 0.3%. There hasn't been much buying conviction in the broader market, although the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.5%) has seen some positive action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.Several factors that have contributed to the negative disposition include President Trump saying there are no signs of China buying U.S. agricultural products, some cautious trading ahead of Apple's (AAPL 208.08, -1.59, -0.8%) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrow, and the disappointing price action in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 205.01, -17.12, -7.7%) following its report.Beyond Meat is perhaps more a reflection of how far many stocks, and the stock market to a certain extent, have come in a short period of time. It isn't too surprising to see some broader consolidation -- or to see shares of Beyond Meat attempting a recovery after being down as much as 17% today.The stock market, too, has come off its lows. At this juncture, the utilities (-0.7%), information technology (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.6%) sectors are underperforming, while the materials (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.4%) sectors are outperforming.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 121.29, +5.29, +4.6%) and Merck (MRK 83.42, +0.94, +1.1%) both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Shares are up nicely on the results, while shares of fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.02, -2.44) are down 5.9% after being downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 89.99, -6.93, -7.2%), meanwhile, is feeling the fallout from a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.Separately, an expectation that interest rates will remain low has prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its S&P 500 2019 year-end target to 3100 and set a 2020 year-end price target of 3400. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up one basis point to 2.07%.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1495/1388. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1702/1263.12:25 ETDow -48.62 at 27172.73, Nasdaq -27.14 at 8266.19, S&P -9.68 at 3011.29[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory without much conviction, much like yesterday's session. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 197.14, +1.20, +0.6%) as the lone stock trading higher, while Netflix (NFLX 324.65, -8.05, -2.4%) underperforms. Apple (AAPL 2018.19, -1.50, -0.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1897.51, -14.84, -0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1229.59, -9.82, -0.8%) trade with losses just below 1%.In earnings news, shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 109.46, +0.75, +0.7%) are up after the company beat profit estimates and raised its FY19 EPS outlook.11:55 ETDow -55.98 at 27165.37, Nasdaq -29.89 at 8263.44, S&P -10.57 at 3010.4[BRIEFING.COM] The rebound attempt has lost some steam, as the S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%. It was still a encouraging to see the benchmark index holding above the 3000 level at its lowest point today.Apple (AAPL 208.21, -1.47, -0.7%) will take the spotlight after today's closing bell when it releases its earnings report. Analyst expectations are low, but interest is high for one of the market's most widely-owned stocks that has already surged nearly 32% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on lower note. Germany's DAX lost 2.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.5%, and France's CAC lost 1.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.5%.11:25 ETDow -24.31 at 27197.04, Nasdaq -24.51 at 8268.82, S&P -8.12 at 3012.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have pared early losses and now trade near session highs. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.3%.The Dow has received some support from shares of Procter & Gamble (PG 121.00, +5.00, +4.3%) and Merck (MRK 83.15, +0.65, +0.8%) following their earnings reports. The blue-chip average, however, is being pressured by losses in most components, including Pfizer (PFE 39.32, -2.12, -5.1%), which was downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Separately, shares of Capital One (COF 90.05, -6.87, -7.1%) are getting hit after the company announced a data breach that affected around 100 million customers in the United States and six million in Canada. The suspected hacker has been arrested.10:55 ETDow -46.35 at 27175, Nasdaq -27.63 at 8265.7, S&P -9.07 at 3011.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, recouping some of its opening losses. Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow.Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock. In addition, its poor showing today has caused some investors to reconsider stocks that have also caught fire this year.10:30 ETDow -70.77 at 27150.58, Nasdaq -37.70 at 8255.63, S&P -11.72 at 3009.25[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.2% at 78.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.11)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now +$0.28 (+0.5%) at $57.16/barrel Aug natural gas is +$0.01 (-0.8%) at $2.13/MMBtuMoving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$6.20 at $1426.70/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.06 (+0.4%) at $16.51/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.2%) at $2.68/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1084/1697. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1070/1739.10:05 ETDow -70.83 at 27150.52, Nasdaq -41.09 at 8252.24, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.5%.Just in, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from a revised 124.3 in June (from 121.5).Separately, Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May.09:45 ETDow -113.35 at 27108, Nasdaq -44.21 at 8249.12, S&P -14.31 at 3006.66[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day lower, partly due to some caution ahead of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow and negative trade rhetoric from President Trump. The S&P 500 is down 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows consumer discretionary (-0.7%), health care (-0.7%), and industrials (-0.7%) leading the market lower. Conversely, the utilities (+0.1%), consumer staples (+0.2%) and real estate (+0.6%) sectors are the lone sectors trading higher.U.S. Treasuries are trading near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.85%, and the 10-yield is down one basis point to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.11. WTI crude is up 0.6% to $57.20/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -59.60.The stock market is on pace to pull back further from all-time highs at the open. Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.De-risking efforts appear to be contributing to the negative disposition, partly due to negative trade rhetoric from President Trump stirring trade concerns. Specifically, the president tweeted that there are "no signs" that China has begun to buy U.S. agricultural products. The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai.In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook.Dow components Procter & Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Fellow Dow member Pfizer (PFE 40.40, -1.05, -2.5%) is down after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a Neutral rating.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index.

Oil prices have been on the rise, too, with crude up 2.1% to $58.08/bbl. The S&P 500 energy sector (+1.2%) is today's best-performing sector.Looking ahead, Apple (AAPL 209.61, -0.08, unch), Amgen (AMGN 175.90, -0.19, -0.1%), and Gilead Sciences (GILD 67.16, -0.71, -1.0%) are some of the more notable companies that will report their earnings after the close.14:30 ETDow -1.75 at 27219.6, Nasdaq -4.63 at 8288.7, S&P -5.38 at 3015.59[BRIEFING.COM] The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite touched above yesterday's close briefly in the last half hour. The S&P 500 lagged behind, though, and still trades at about 0.18% lower. The catalyst appears two fold: comments from President Donald Trump spoke to reporters in front of the White House stating he, "spoke recently with Chinese President Xi," in addition to the recent spike in crude oil futures.The worst-performing names in the S&P 500 today include Gartner (IT 138.97, -31.76, -18.60%), Under Armour (UAA 23.97, -3.47, -12.65%), and HCA (HCA). Theses three all reported earnings in the last 24 hours, all three made multi week lows, and all three were at multi month highs heading into their respective results.Conversely, Natl Oilwell Varco (NOV 23.01, +2.33, +11.27%) sits atop the index, helped in part by today's rise in crude oil futures.14:00 ETDow -46.71 at 27174.64, Nasdaq -16.15 at 8277.18, S&P -8.46 at 3012.51[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite made a session high in the last 30 minutes, now just 0.19% lower vs 0.79% at today's lows.Gold futures moved higher on Tuesday, settling higher by 0.7% to $1,430.20/oz; the yellow metal posted modest gains juxtaposed against the start of the two day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.The U.S. Dollar Index sits less than 0.1% higher to 98.09.13:35 ETDow -58.28 at 27163.07, Nasdaq -26.26 at 8267.07, S&P -10.73 at 3010.24[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are little changed in the last 30 minutes; the Dow Jones Industrial Average still holds the softest declines on Tuesday, down about 0.21%.Today's losses in Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent Pfizer (PFE 38.85, -2.60, -6.27%) have been widely covered; behind PFE shares of Caterpillar (CAT 132.64, -1.82, -1.35%), Walt Disney (DIS 144.71, -1.68, -1.15%), and Intel (INTC 51.98, -0.53, -1.01%) cling to decent losses. DIS gives back a portion of yesterday's all-time highs which were tied to a strong weekend from the company's The Lion King remake, while INTC falls following a cautious sell side mention.Conversely, Boeing (BA 343.38, +3.17, +0.93%) sits near the top of the index, recovering slightly from recent losses, as it appears no bad news is essentially good news for the embattled aerospace and defense company.The DJIA gives back a portion of the recovery from the last two days, now down some 0.68% over the last calendar week.12:55 ETDow -56.49 at 27164.86, Nasdaq -30.01 at 8263.32, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory today with the S&P 500 currently down 0.3%. There hasn't been much buying conviction in the broader market, although the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.5%) has seen some positive action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.Several factors that have contributed to the negative disposition include President Trump saying there are no signs of China buying U.S. agricultural products, some cautious trading ahead of Apple's (AAPL 208.08, -1.59, -0.8%) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrow, and the disappointing price action in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 205.01, -17.12, -7.7%) following its report.Beyond Meat is perhaps more a reflection of how far many stocks, and the stock market to a certain extent, have come in a short period of time. It isn't too surprising to see some broader consolidation -- or to see shares of Beyond Meat attempting a recovery after being down as much as 17% today.The stock market, too, has come off its lows. At this juncture, the utilities (-0.7%), information technology (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.6%) sectors are underperforming, while the materials (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.4%) sectors are outperforming.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 121.29, +5.29, +4.6%) and Merck (MRK 83.42, +0.94, +1.1%) both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Shares are up nicely on the results, while shares of fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.02, -2.44) are down 5.9% after being downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 89.99, -6.93, -7.2%), meanwhile, is feeling the fallout from a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.Separately, an expectation that interest rates will remain low has prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its S&P 500 2019 year-end target to 3100 and set a 2020 year-end price target of 3400. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up one basis point to 2.07%.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1495/1388. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1702/1263.12:25 ETDow -48.62 at 27172.73, Nasdaq -27.14 at 8266.19, S&P -9.68 at 3011.29[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory without much conviction, much like yesterday's session. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 197.14, +1.20, +0.6%) as the lone stock trading higher, while Netflix (NFLX 324.65, -8.05, -2.4%) underperforms. Apple (AAPL 2018.19, -1.50, -0.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1897.51, -14.84, -0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1229.59, -9.82, -0.8%) trade with losses just below 1%.In earnings news, shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 109.46, +0.75, +0.7%) are up after the company beat profit estimates and raised its FY19 EPS outlook.11:55 ETDow -55.98 at 27165.37, Nasdaq -29.89 at 8263.44, S&P -10.57 at 3010.4[BRIEFING.COM] The rebound attempt has lost some steam, as the S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%. It was still a encouraging to see the benchmark index holding above the 3000 level at its lowest point today.Apple (AAPL 208.21, -1.47, -0.7%) will take the spotlight after today's closing bell when it releases its earnings report. Analyst expectations are low, but interest is high for one of the market's most widely-owned stocks that has already surged nearly 32% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on lower note. Germany's DAX lost 2.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.5%, and France's CAC lost 1.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.5%.11:25 ETDow -24.31 at 27197.04, Nasdaq -24.51 at 8268.82, S&P -8.12 at 3012.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have pared early losses and now trade near session highs. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.3%.The Dow has received some support from shares of Procter & Gamble (PG 121.00, +5.00, +4.3%) and Merck (MRK 83.15, +0.65, +0.8%) following their earnings reports. The blue-chip average, however, is being pressured by losses in most components, including Pfizer (PFE 39.32, -2.12, -5.1%), which was downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Separately, shares of Capital One (COF 90.05, -6.87, -7.1%) are getting hit after the company announced a data breach that affected around 100 million customers in the United States and six million in Canada. The suspected hacker has been arrested.10:55 ETDow -46.35 at 27175, Nasdaq -27.63 at 8265.7, S&P -9.07 at 3011.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, recouping some of its opening losses. Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow.Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock. In addition, its poor showing today has caused some investors to reconsider stocks that have also caught fire this year.10:30 ETDow -70.77 at 27150.58, Nasdaq -37.70 at 8255.63, S&P -11.72 at 3009.25[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.2% at 78.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.11)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now +$0.28 (+0.5%) at $57.16/barrel Aug natural gas is +$0.01 (-0.8%) at $2.13/MMBtuMoving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$6.20 at $1426.70/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.06 (+0.4%) at $16.51/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.2%) at $2.68/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1084/1697. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1070/1739.10:05 ETDow -70.83 at 27150.52, Nasdaq -41.09 at 8252.24, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.5%.Just in, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from a revised 124.3 in June (from 121.5).Separately, Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May.09:45 ETDow -113.35 at 27108, Nasdaq -44.21 at 8249.12, S&P -14.31 at 3006.66[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day lower, partly due to some caution ahead of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow and negative trade rhetoric from President Trump. The S&P 500 is down 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows consumer discretionary (-0.7%), health care (-0.7%), and industrials (-0.7%) leading the market lower. Conversely, the utilities (+0.1%), consumer staples (+0.2%) and real estate (+0.6%) sectors are the lone sectors trading higher.U.S. Treasuries are trading near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.85%, and the 10-yield is down one basis point to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.11. WTI crude is up 0.6% to $57.20/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -59.60.The stock market is on pace to pull back further from all-time highs at the open. Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.De-risking efforts appear to be contributing to the negative disposition, partly due to negative trade rhetoric from President Trump stirring trade concerns. Specifically, the president tweeted that there are "no signs" that China has begun to buy U.S. agricultural products. The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai.In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook.Dow components Procter & Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Fellow Dow member Pfizer (PFE 40.40, -1.05, -2.5%) is down after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a Neutral rating.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index. Investors will also receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, Pending Home Sales for June, and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May.Nasdaq Composite +25.0% YTDS&P 500 +20.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.7% YTDRussell 2000 +16.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1472/1420. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1183/1867.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 30, 2019End of Document

There weren't too many positive catalysts for the broader market, but the small-cap Russell 2000 did advance 1.1% to finish near session highs.The S&P 500's worst levels of the day came shortly after the open, as investors appeared uninterested to participate in the action in front of Apple's (AAPL 208.78, -0.90, -0.4%) earnings report after the close and the FOMC's rate decision tomorrow. President Trump alleging that China has yet to buy U.S. agricultural products added to the negative tone.Still, aside from some profit taking in hot-flying stocks like Beyond Meat (BYND 194.76, -27.37, -12.3%) and Under Armour (UAA 24.08, -3.36, -12.2%) following their earnings reports, there was no serious interest to withdraw from the broader market. At its low, the S&P 500 was down 0.7% and hanging just above the 3000 level, where it would firmly stay above the rest of the day.The final standings reflected a mixed session with five S&P 500 sectors finishing higher and six sectors finishing lower. The utilities (-0.8%), information technology (-0.7%), and consumer discretionary (-0.7%) sectors underperformed, while the energy (+1.1%), real estate (+0.9%), and materials (+0.6%) sectors finished on top.Energy stocks gained traction as oil prices ($58.05, +1.18, +2.1%) made a big move in the afternoon on no confirmed news catalyst. The noticeable gain today could have been derived from speculation that the Fed's expected rate cut tomorrow could increase demand for oil.In other corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 120.41, +4.41, +3.8%) and Merck (MRK 83.27, +0.78, +1.0%) pleased investors with their earnings results. Pfizer (PFE 38.79, -2.66) fell 6.4% after the stock was downgraded at both Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 91.21, -5.71) fell 5.9% after disclosing a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower in another muted session. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point each to 1.85% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished unchanged at 98.05.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May.Looking ahead, investors will receive the FOMC rate decision, the ADP Employment Change report for July, the Chicago PMI for July, the Employment Cost Index for the second quarter, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +24.7% YTDS&P 500 +20.2% YTDRussell 2000 +17.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1728/1168. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1883/1170.15:25 ETDow -42.10 at 27179.25, Nasdaq -20.65 at 8272.68, S&P -9.63 at 3011.34[BRIEFING.COM] Metals Settlement Prices:December gold settled up $10.80 (0.8%) at $1444.10/ozSeptember silver settled up $0.165 higher (1.0%) at $16.605/ozSeptember copper settled down $0.0405 lower (0.1%) at $2.677/lbAgriculture Settlement Prices:Sept corn settled $0.05 lower at $4.11/bushelSept wheat settled $0.06 lower at $4.97/bushelNov soybeans settled $0.07 lower at $8.96/bushelEnergy Settlement Prices:September Crude Oil futures rose $1.18 (2.1%) to $58.05/barrelSept Natural Gas rose $0.021 (0.1%) at $2.137/MMBtuSept RBOB Gasoline rose $0.0307 (0.2%) at $1.846/gallonSept Heating Oil rose $0.0323 (0.2%) at $1.9526/gallon ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1655/1279. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1865/1163.14:55 ETDow -29.91 at 27191.44, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8280.29, S&P -7.52 at 3013.45[BRIEFING.COM] Some of the prior trade-related enthusiasm has eased a bit, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the moment.It should be noted that President Trump did not specify when he spoke with his Chinese counterpart, but it was still soothing for the market to hear. Oil prices have been on the rise, too, with crude up 2.1% to $58.08/bbl. The S&P 500 energy sector (+1.2%) is today's best-performing sector.Looking ahead, Apple (AAPL 209.61, -0.08, unch), Amgen (AMGN 175.90, -0.19, -0.1%), and Gilead Sciences (GILD 67.16, -0.71, -1.0%) are some of the more notable companies that will report their earnings after the close.14:30 ETDow -1.75 at 27219.6, Nasdaq -4.63 at 8288.7, S&P -5.38 at 3015.59[BRIEFING.COM] The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite touched above yesterday's close briefly in the last half hour. The S&P 500 lagged behind, though, and still trades at about 0.18% lower. The catalyst appears two fold: comments from President Donald Trump spoke to reporters in front of the White House stating he, "spoke recently with Chinese President Xi," in addition to the recent spike in crude oil futures.The worst-performing names in the S&P 500 today include Gartner (IT 138.97, -31.76, -18.60%), Under Armour (UAA 23.97, -3.47, -12.65%), and HCA (HCA). Theses three all reported earnings in the last 24 hours, all three made multi week lows, and all three were at multi month highs heading into their respective results.Conversely, Natl Oilwell Varco (NOV 23.01, +2.33, +11.27%) sits atop the index, helped in part by today's rise in crude oil futures.14:00 ETDow -46.71 at 27174.64, Nasdaq -16.15 at 8277.18, S&P -8.46 at 3012.51[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite made a session high in the last 30 minutes, now just 0.19% lower vs 0.79% at today's lows.Gold futures moved higher on Tuesday, settling higher by 0.7% to $1,430.20/oz; the yellow metal posted modest gains juxtaposed against the start of the two day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.The U.S. Dollar Index sits less than 0.1% higher to 98.09.13:35 ETDow -58.28 at 27163.07, Nasdaq -26.26 at 8267.07, S&P -10.73 at 3010.24[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are little changed in the last 30 minutes; the Dow Jones Industrial Average still holds the softest declines on Tuesday, down about 0.21%.Today's losses in Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent Pfizer (PFE 38.85, -2.60, -6.27%) have been widely covered; behind PFE shares of Caterpillar (CAT 132.64, -1.82, -1.35%), Walt Disney (DIS 144.71, -1.68, -1.15%), and Intel (INTC 51.98, -0.53, -1.01%) cling to decent losses. DIS gives back a portion of yesterday's all-time highs which were tied to a strong weekend from the company's The Lion King remake, while INTC falls following a cautious sell side mention.Conversely, Boeing (BA 343.38, +3.17, +0.93%) sits near the top of the index, recovering slightly from recent losses, as it appears no bad news is essentially good news for the embattled aerospace and defense company.The DJIA gives back a portion of the recovery from the last two days, now down some 0.68% over the last calendar week.12:55 ETDow -56.49 at 27164.86, Nasdaq -30.01 at 8263.32, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory today with the S&P 500 currently down 0.3%. There hasn't been much buying conviction in the broader market, although the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.5%) has seen some positive action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.Several factors that have contributed to the negative disposition include President Trump saying there are no signs of China buying U.S. agricultural products, some cautious trading ahead of Apple's (AAPL 208.08, -1.59, -0.8%) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrow, and the disappointing price action in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 205.01, -17.12, -7.7%) following its report.Beyond Meat is perhaps more a reflection of how far many stocks, and the stock market to a certain extent, have come in a short period of time. It isn't too surprising to see some broader consolidation -- or to see shares of Beyond Meat attempting a recovery after being down as much as 17% today.The stock market, too, has come off its lows. At this juncture, the utilities (-0.7%), information technology (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.6%) sectors are underperforming, while the materials (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.4%) sectors are outperforming.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 121.29, +5.29, +4.6%) and Merck (MRK 83.42, +0.94, +1.1%) both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Shares are up nicely on the results, while shares of fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.02, -2.44) are down 5.9% after being downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 89.99, -6.93, -7.2%), meanwhile, is feeling the fallout from a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.Separately, an expectation that interest rates will remain low has prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its S&P 500 2019 year-end target to 3100 and set a 2020 year-end price target of 3400. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up one basis point to 2.07%.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 197.14, +1.20, +0.6%) as the lone stock trading higher, while Netflix (NFLX 324.65, -8.05, -2.4%) underperforms. Apple (AAPL 2018.19, -1.50, -0.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1897.51, -14.84, -0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1229.59, -9.82, -0.8%) trade with losses just below 1%.In earnings news, shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 109.46, +0.75, +0.7%) are up after the company beat profit estimates and raised its FY19 EPS outlook.11:55 ETDow -55.98 at 27165.37, Nasdaq -29.89 at 8263.44, S&P -10.57 at 3010.4[BRIEFING.COM] The rebound attempt has lost some steam, as the S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%. It was still a encouraging to see the benchmark index holding above the 3000 level at its lowest point today.Apple (AAPL 208.21, -1.47, -0.7%) will take the spotlight after today's closing bell when it releases its earnings report. Analyst expectations are low, but interest is high for one of the market's most widely-owned stocks that has already surged nearly 32% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on lower note. Germany's DAX lost 2.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.5%, and France's CAC lost 1.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.5%.11:25 ETDow -24.31 at 27197.04, Nasdaq -24.51 at 8268.82, S&P -8.12 at 3012.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have pared early losses and now trade near session highs. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.3%.The Dow has received some support from shares of Procter & Gamble (PG 121.00, +5.00, +4.3%) and Merck (MRK 83.15, +0.65, +0.8%) following their earnings reports. The blue-chip average, however, is being pressured by losses in most components, including Pfizer (PFE 39.32, -2.12, -5.1%), which was downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Separately, shares of Capital One (COF 90.05, -6.87, -7.1%) are getting hit after the company announced a data breach that affected around 100 million customers in the United States and six million in Canada. The suspected hacker has been arrested.10:55 ETDow -46.35 at 27175, Nasdaq -27.63 at 8265.7, S&P -9.07 at 3011.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, recouping some of its opening losses. Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow.Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock. In addition, its poor showing today has caused some investors to reconsider stocks that have also caught fire this year.10:30 ETDow -70.77 at 27150.58, Nasdaq -37.70 at 8255.63, S&P -11.72 at 3009.25[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.2% at 78.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.11)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now +$0.28 (+0.5%) at $57.16/barrel Aug natural gas is +$0.01 (-0.8%) at $2.13/MMBtuMoving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$6.20 at $1426.70/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.06 (+0.4%) at $16.51/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.2%) at $2.68/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1084/1697. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1070/1739.10:05 ETDow -70.83 at 27150.52, Nasdaq -41.09 at 8252.24, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.5%.Just in, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from a revised 124.3 in June (from 121.5).Separately, Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%).

The S&P 500 is down 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows consumer discretionary (-0.7%), health care (-0.7%), and industrials (-0.7%) leading the market lower. Conversely, the utilities (+0.1%), consumer staples (+0.2%) and real estate (+0.6%) sectors are the lone sectors trading higher.U.S. Treasuries are trading near their unchanged marks.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -59.60.The stock market is on pace to pull back further from all-time highs at the open. Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.De-risking efforts appear to be contributing to the negative disposition, partly due to negative trade rhetoric from President Trump stirring trade concerns. Specifically, the president tweeted that there are "no signs" that China has begun to buy U.S. agricultural products. The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai.In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook.Dow components Procter & Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Fellow Dow member Pfizer (PFE 40.40, -1.05, -2.5%) is down after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a Neutral rating.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%).

Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04.

Dollar exceeds $20 for EU-China conflictCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 6, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 312 wordsBodyThe Universal/Tláloc PugaThe dollar surpassed 20 pesos for the first time in the past two months, because investors are concerned about trade problems between the United States and China. The currency was sold yesterday afternoon at 20.02 pesos on CitiBanamex and meant the most expensive price since June 6th, when it was then trading at 20.05 units.This is an uptick of 40 cents compared to Friday, the biggest rise in a single day since the end of May. The dollar has risen 65 cents since Wednesday last week, due to trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, as well as the eventual impact this can have on the global economy.The Chinese government yesterday allowed the yuan to fall below the threshold of seven units per dollar, for the first time in more than a decade, as US President Donald Trump described as a "great violation."Last Friday, the Asian country asked state-owned companies to suspend american union purchases of agricultural products, after days earlier Trump surprised with the announcement of a new 10% tariff on Chinese goods valued at $300 billion 1 September, ending any truce in the trade dispute. Reuters figures indicate that the wholesale dollar went on to be listed last night at 19.73 pesos in international negotiations, where more transactions are made with the Mexican currency.Fears of a global slowdown, in the face of the U.S.-China trade struggle, also threw oil and stock exchanges. The Mexican mix finished at $52.32 yesterday, the lowest price since January 28, and has lost more than seven dollars since Wednesday. The Mexican Stock Exchange finished in 39 thousand 502 points, its second day followed below 40 thousand units. The stock market crash in Mexico went hand in hand with its peers in the United States. Industrial Dow Jones and the S&P; 500 sank more than 2%, while the Nasdaq slumped 3.5 percent. Load-Date: August 7, 2019End of Document

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 31.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Apple's strong third quarter, the stock is up this morning, set to add 60 points to the Dow Jones Industrial average, even as iPhone sales decline. CEO Tim Cook says that the decline was actually good news. We're going to tell you why.And then we're on the countdown to the Federal Reserve's decision. The central bank expected to cut interest rates today, first time that will happen since the Great Recession back in 2008. Markets this morning and the health of the economy on tap right here.Futures right now getting a lift from Apple, trading up 60 points, quarter of a percent on the Dow. S&P futures up four and a quarter points. And the Nasdaq futures higher by 25.We had General Electric out with a double beat. It also raised its profit outlook. The company's CFO is stepping down and the search is underway for a replacement. The stock is up almost 5 percent. We've got more on that coming up.Yesterday, the markets slipped after President Trump made a comment about China trade talks, saying that China does not come through on its agreements and warned China not to wait for the 2020 election to do a deal. According to Chinese state media, trade negotiators will meet again in September, this time in the United States. Mnuchin and Lighthizer are in Shanghai today.Markets this morning globally are mixed. Take a look at the European indices. The FT 100 down 50 points, CAC 40 is up 4, and the DAX index in Germany up 36. Germany was down big yesterday. The consumer apparently strengthening in Germany. Retail sales posted the biggest monthly jump since December 2006 in Germany.In Asia overnight markets were down as hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal happening any time soon diminished. There's also more signs of a slowdown in China. We have new economic data today. Factory activity contracting for the third month in a row. As you see the indices were lower and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was the worst performer.The showdown in Motor City -- Democrats going head to head last night on the economy, healthcare immigration. We've got more big moments from last night's debate and anticipating another one tonight.Then the high cost of higher education, parents taking extreme measures to get a break on tuition, giving up guardianship of their kids.All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the "Wall Street Journal's" editor in chief Matt Murray; and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.Great to see everybody this morning.MATT MURRAY, EDITOR IN CHIEF, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Great to be here.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: What are you looking at?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Trade. I want to know, do the markets -- because Lindsey's talked about this all year -- do the markets need to see a trade deal before the end of the year" Because that was your prediction from going into 2019, I think.BELL: I know but now listening to some of the industrial and tech companies, I think what they need to see is non-escalation of trade conflicts. And no increases in tariffs.And I think as long as we can drag this thing out, these companies are able to deal with the tariffs that are currently in place.BARTIROMO: But the longer we go without a USMCA deal ratified is going to be unnerving, right? I mean, now -- yesterday we had a couple of guests on who said they expect it's going to will come to the floor in the fall.But I don't know. What is going to move Nancy Pelosi to move USMCA to the floor, get a vote -- Matt?MURRAY: Yes. I don't think she's got a lot of motivation, other than to show -- the one thing that might help her move it is to show the Democrats are moving legislation, are getting things done, aren't just sort of pursuing unrealistic policies but are trying to show a record of achievement. That might help.But I don't think she's (INAUDIBLE) particularly strongly so far.BARTIROMO: Because most people think if it does come to the floor it will pass. We'll see.MCDOWELL: What will make her move on it is knowing that the Republicans only need to win I think 18 seats, 19 seats next year to win back the house so she'll move on that. if she thinks that the House is in jeopardy, she'll move on it.MURRAY: If she thinks the moderates in the Democratic Party need that win, then they'll move on it.MCDOWELL: Right. I'll double check that. I think it's 18, 19 -- 18 seats but I'll check it.BARTIROMO: We're watching the economy. We've got the ADP report coming out.And this hour -- big story on Apple, the stock is on the move after an earnings beat. The technology titan reported earnings of $2.18 a share versus an estimate of $2.10, that was better than expected. Revenue was up to $53.8 billion, following back to back revenue declines in the previous quarters.Guidance for the quarter also topped expectation. It's pushing Apple's market cap back towards the trillion dollar territory. But iPhone sales did slump in the quarter. Tough competition from China like Huawei. Customers holding on to their smartphones longer weighing on the results as well.Having said that, the stock is up this morning, four and a third percent on Apple $217.75.Joining us right now is CFRA research senior equity analyst, Angelo Zino. Angelo -- it's good to see you.ANGELO ZINO, RESEARCH SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, CFRA: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: How is the second quarter earnings reporting season been going so far?ZINO: Overall, I think it's been, you know, better than expected. I think kind of the key for Apple as well as, you know, for the broader, you know, coverage area that I cover is, you know, companies are beating fairly low - - a very low bar, in terms of guidance as well.I mean the expectations have been fairly low and they're exceeding those expectations. I think a lot of that specifically is coming out of China. I think, you know, you're seeing better than -- you know, numbers coming out of that region specifically.BARTIROMO: Yes. Because it's the guidance that everybody cares about. What do they think about the rest of the year and going into 2020, right? And the guidance you say has been a little better than expected.ZINO: Yes, absolutely. So when we look at, you know, Apple specifically, if we were to take kind of the one big takeaway out of the quarter, it really does come down to China. China was down 4 percent year over year this quarter compared to down 22 percent and down 27 percent the last two quarters.So again, you know, the trajectory much better than expected. We expected stabilization out of China to start coming closer to the December quarter when you started seeing kind of the more favorable comps on that side of things, came two quarters earlier than we anticipated.MURRAY: Angelo, broadly how does the global economy look for a lot of the companies you're following? China as you say is an issue, they really slowed down. Europe is not in good shape. Yes, the U.S. is hanging in pretty well at this point but how long can the U.S. keep powering growth for companies?ZINO: Yes, it's interesting. I think, you know, from a broader level, the U.S. and Europe have hung in there. We are seeing some pockets of weakness, I'd say from some of the supply chain names in areas -- in certain areas of the U.S. and Europe -- areas like autos potentially.But that being said, listen, I think it hangs in there. I do think the order trajectory in China is starting to see some notable improvement in the supply chain. So even if we were to see some softness come out of the U.S. and Europe, I think that's more than offset in potential better than expected results coming out of China.BARTIROMO: Well, we haven't seen a lot of growth out of Europe. It's really hard to generate any growth there and we heard Mario Draghi say more stimulus is on the way.ZINO: Right.BARTIROMO: So what will that stimulus look like? You know, I told you what Rick Reeder (ph) said from Blackrock. He was on the show a couple of weeks ago. He said there's no wiggle room whatsoever in terms of rates, they're already negative. They're not able to cut rates, so what are they going to do.Christine Lagarde coming in, she's a politician. She's not an economist. What is she going to do? She's going to buy European equities. That's why Rick Reeder of Blackrock is buying European equities. What do you think about that?ZINO: Yes. No, I mean, you know, as far as Europe is concerned too, to your point, I mean there's been essentially no growth coming out of there. And we think that just continues in the foreseeable future.BELL: Angelo -- you and I were talking yesterday before the Apple report about the Huawei report that came out that revenue was up 23 percent in the first half, they're taking market share over there in China. And you said to me, you see this as a positive for Apple. Can you explain why?ZINO: Yes. No. So when we think about what's going on in China for Apple, they've made some moves on their end that you know, we think it's really helped them, whether it be trade-in programs, whether it be financing options for the consumer to make things more affordable. But I think when you look out at Huawei's results and now, you know, Apple's results, I think it tells you that the consumer is actually coming back in China.And I think that's really kind of helping Apple's results. I think that's helping a lot of the consumer-oriented names as well.BARTIROMO: Yes. By the way, we also saw the consumer strong in the GDP last week. It was the consumer that was driving the GDP last week, not the business sector.MCDOWELL: In China, do we need to watch out for disinformation campaigns out of the Chinese government about Apple, Huawei -- I brought up --BARTIROMO: I think you're right about that.MCDOWELL: -- touting, because again, that's not something that you would necessarily see on the surface but it bubbles up from wherever in China. But also with Huawei touting itself as the patriotic option in the country. So what should we watch out for in terms of hazards?ZINO: Yes, absolutely. So when we think about the two biggest risks for Apple in general, one is the China market. The other is the regulatory issues because of that services business growing. But when we think about China, clearly it has one to do with trade and what's going on with -- on the trades side of things.But our view is the bigger risk in China continues to be -- if you look at Samsung a couple years ago, they once owned 20 percent of the market. They now own less than 1 percent of the market in China. They've essentially been thrown out because of Huawei at the low-end of the market as well as the high-end of the market between Huawei and Apple.And, you know, when we kind of look at what the risk here is for Apple here in China, I think it potentially is them continuing to lose market share. At one point had north 15 percent share. They now have less than 10 percent of the market.BARTIROMO: Yes.ZINO: And I do think you know, to your point, Dagen -- Apple could kind of be smeared in terms of the China market there going forward and I think that's once again an opportunity for Huawei.And if you think about it here in the U.S., Huawei has no share. The U.S. doesn't allow Huawei to essentially kind of compete in this market. I think that could potentially be harmful in China at some point in time.BARTIROMO: Yes. They will do whatever they can. They'll use propaganda to make the point. Angelo -- it's great to have you.ZINO: All right. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Angelo Zino joining us there.2020 Democrats facing off last night, sounding off in Detroit on the economy, jobs, trade.Hillary Vaughn was there for round two, part one of the Democratic debates. Hillary -- good morning to you.HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning -- Maria.Voters really got to see a tug of war between progressive policies and a more moderate approach at the debate last night. In fact, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were asked if they think their ideas are too far left to beat Trump in 2020. And some candidates on the stage with them last night said that they do think that progressive promises are not a winning strategy for 2020.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think if we're going to force Americans to make these radical changes, they're not going to go along. Throw your hands up.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can do it. But you haven't implemented the plan. You can't just spring a plan on the world and expect it to succeed.SANDERS: Every credible poll that I have seen has me beating Donald Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hillary Clinton was winning in the polls too. In this discussion already tonight, we've talked about taking private health insurance away from union members in the industrial Midwest. We've talked about decriminalizing the border. And we've talked about giving free healthcare to undocumented workers when so many Americans are struggling to pay for their healthcare.I quite frankly don't think that that is an agenda that we can move forward on and win.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN: One of those he progressive policies in the hot seat, Medicare for all. Former Congressman John Delaney has personal experience in the healthcare industry. He told Sanders that his plan for Medicare for all will not pay for itself because Sanders wants to eliminate private insurance. He says Medicare for all rates only cover 80 percent of the cost. Private insurance picks up the 20 percent remaining. So Delaney told Sanders last night the math just doesn't add up -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Hillary -- thank you. Hillary Vaughn in Detroit this morning.Coming up, warning signs. New details emerging about the accused hacker behind the Capital One breach. Cloud security now front and center.Plus, the high cost of college, some parents go to the extreme making sure their kids' education bill gets paid. What they're doing -- wait until you hear this, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We are learning more about the woman accused of hacking into more than 100 million credit card accounts at Capital One.Deirdre Bolton with the latest right now. Good morning -- Deirdre.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Yes. Good morning -- Maria.So this person was struggling and I think we can tell that by her actions. I should keep saying "alleged" and the woman who has been charged with stealing 100 million people's data. But she's a transgender woman. She has been hopping from job to job -- former employers have described as somebody who was angry.She was actually tweeting out that she was going to check herself into a mental health facility a few weeks before she was arrested. On her Twitter account, which I will note has been suspended, she actually wrote something and said "I've basically strapped myself with a bomb vest, f-ing dropping Capital One's docs and admitting it to the point where another hacker on another platform said please don't go to jail over this."I think this happens with a lot of hackers. They're operating on the fringe but they still want credit somehow from the community for achieving something, and in this case it was stealing social security numbers and credit card numbers and dates of birth.And I think what this means for these companies, right, is to what extent are they willing to go more and more to the Cloud. Unfortunately, for Capital One, it was an early adopter five years ago, went to the Cloud. Most security experts are saying that while Amazon web services is at the heart of this particular issue, that it's not really at fault.For example, this young lady actually used an access point in the firewall. It wasn't really a problem technically with the Cloud. She accessed it another way. But just in the way that the story is developing, oddly enough she had worked for Amazon Cloud services for a number of years.But she's clearly mentally having a lot of battles. In fact, one thing that let the FBI find her home address was she had shared a vet bill. I guess her cat was sick, so it had her home address. It had her real name and that's one of the reasons that they were able to find her and arrest her.BARTIROMO: Wow -- incredible story.BLOCK: It really is. It just shows somebody very much on the fringe but who still wanted some sort of acceptance, if you like, from her peer group.But we know with Equifax, for example, which went through a similar hack, they just paid $700 million to settle a lawsuit, I should mention a class action lawsuit was filed yesterday in D.C., someone in Connecticut who has been affected has started to gather the troops.MURRAY: You know, Maria -- what is a little chilling in this case, a lot of hacks we think about them, we think of foreign agents or people overseas. It's a reminder that for big companies, you've got all kinds of vendors coming in and out, you've got all kinds of people doing different services on the web or on any other thing. And a really determined hacker who's got an inside track -- it's very, very hard to stop.BARTIROMO: Yes.MURRAY: It's very hard to do anything about that. And I think I think that's got to have a lot of companies looking at the situation closely and thinking again about their security protocols.BARTIROMO: You're right. We were saying that yesterday when the story first broke. We were thinking well, maybe it's China, maybe it's Russia. Oh, no, it's an American citizen, a woman. So scary stuff.Deirdre -- thanks.(CROSSTALKING)BOLTON: Sure. Thanks.BARTIROMO: We'll keep watching that.Coming up, all eyes on the Federal Reserve today, the central bank's crucial rate decision coming this afternoon. Fox Business will have complete coverage, live right here at 2:00. And we're expecting a quarter point cut.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Futures are higher this morning. We're at the highs of the morning right here. Of course, partly Apple. Dow futures up 71 points, quarter of a percent. The S&P futures up 5.75. And the Nasdaq futures up by 30 points right now.Investors are waiting on the fed this afternoon. The Federal Reserve expected to cut rates by a quarter point. We'll know at 2:15 p.m. Eastern. And we know we'll hear from Jay Powell as well.Joining us right now is the vice chairman and head of Investment Solutions Group at Bank of America, Keith Banks. Keith -- it's great to see you.KEITH BANKS, INVESTMENT SOLUTIONS GROUP HEAD, BANK OF AMERICA: Always good to be here -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us.You're obviously expecting a cut as well, right.BANKS: We are.BARTIROMO: Yes. so what kind of impact is that going to have do you think, market reaction and impact on the economy?BANKS: Well, I think if we get to 25 basis points that I think the world now believes is going to be the outcome, that in and of itself shouldn't do a whole lot. I think the key is going to be what is the verbiage coming out? Do they talk about the -- you know, reinforce the possibility of further cuts, number one? Do they talk about maybe ending quantitative tightening a bit early -- this balance sheet runoff? That would be I think new news.But I think what the market wants to hear is that they're going to continue to look at the data and the data will dictate further action and most people believe further action that's required will in fact be additional cuts.BARTIROMO: I wonder if we're going to hear the winddown slowdown, $3.8 trillion now on the Federal Reserve balance sheet, they're supposed to get that all the down until like to close to $3 trillion or below $3 trillion. Is that something you're hearing as well, that maybe they come out with commentary on the balance sheet that they maybe stop the winding down?BANKS: I think it's one of the areas of speculation.BARTIROMO: Because that's in effect the tightening.BANKS: Yes.MURRAY: Keith -- can I ask, what problem do you think they're trying to solve? I'm asking because even though the market's priced it in, look, mortgage rates are coming down on their own, the economy is still doing pretty well. They didn't move last December when the market went haywire for a few weeks.Is it the right thing to cut rates? Should they keep cutting? What is the problem -- do you think there's a problem for them to solve?BANKS: I do think they should cut rates, number one. I do not think they're solving for the markets. I don't think they really care a whole lot about what the equity markets do unless maybe it begins to back up on consumer sentiment and business sentiment. But I think the real key is we've got -- we're now in the 11th year of the economic expansion and we've got inflation around 1.5 percent.When we go into the next downturn and there will be a next downturn, we don't think soon, that's not a lot of cushion. 150 basis points of inflation and zero and deflation is a pretty tight, you know, pretty tight fan there.BARTIROMO: Especially while the rest of the world is cutting and stimulating.BANKS: Especially while the rest of the world is cutting, especially while the rest of the world is slowing. So I think what they're trying to do is get the economy to run hotter. See if we can get a more reflationary environment. And also, you know, ensure that we've got, you know, as healthy an environment as possible when we do enter the next downturn which we don't think will be for at least a couple of years. But it will happen.BARTIROMO: Wow.BELL: But to get inflation going -- 25 basis points, do you really think that's going to do it or are you saying that there's going to be multiple cuts in the remainder of year and into 2020? What are your expectations?BANKS: You're right. 25 basis points in and of itself is not going to -- it's not the magic wand that's going to suddenly change everything.BARTIROMO: No, but he market expects like three cuts.BANKS: Yes. But I think the market expects three cuts. Our hope is that as you begin to see in the second half a pickup in foreign activity, we've seen a lot of stimulus coming out of China, we do think that will begin to show itself.You've got at last count at least 15 central banks are in easing mode. We'll probably see something in September out of Europe, maybe a quantitative easing 2 out of Europe. I don't know how much you can --BARTIROMO: What are they going to do? I mean because they're at negative rates, right?BANKS: Yes. I mean lower rates, going from negative 41 basis points on the 10-year boom in Germany to negative 51 is not going to probably do a whole lot.BARTIROMO: Right.BANKS: But, you know, it's got to be something more creative in terms of, you know, buying back bonds or something else --BARTIROMO: Or buying stocks.BANKS: -- or buying stocks. You mentioned Rick has said that last week because they've got to get more creative. It's not just about lowering rates. I think all the above is important.MCDOWELL: How about structural reform in Europe?BANKS: Structural reform would be wonderful.MCDOWELL: Yes, labor reform.BANKS: That would be -- I'm not sure we can count on that -- Dagen. But that would be --(CROSSTALKING)MURRAY: What about Brexit? We're seeing -- we're really seeing the pound take a beating this week. Is that going to matter at all here in the fall?BANKS: Well, I think Brexit is one of a number of things that matter. And it's part of -- I think when the -- even the fed thinks about the U.S. and our rates, they're looking at a global picture because our U.S. companies are so global, especially in the S&P 500, foreign activity matters. I think over almost 32 percent of S&P 500 earnings now come from foreign profits.BARTIROMO: It's a big number.BANKS: So the Fed is looking at this big mosaic of information that I think is driving them toward the action we hope they're going to take today which would be the beginning of multiple steps.BARTIROMO: We've got the Eurozone GDP out, second quarter was in line. Taiwan was better in the second quarter. How would you characterize the global economy right now.BANKS: Well, you know, it's interesting. We're on a dual track. Our research team wrote a report called "The Great Divide" because you're got the U.S., which is being powered by the consumer, small business, housing, things of that nature, all of which are strong or in good shape -- at least small business and consumer. And the rest of the world is more dependent on trade and manufacturing which is the sweet spot of weakness.And so what's been ironic is that the tightening we did in the U.S. in 2018 and the trade war we've been undertaking with China has had a bigger impact and a much more negative impact on the rest of the world.So, you know, we're kind of pulling away from the rest of the world as far as growth which is one of the reasons why we like the U.S. market better than we like the international developed markets because we just think that's going to continue. We're going to grow we believe at or above trend in the U.S. And the rest of the world is going to struggle to grow at trend, more likely for a while below trend.BARTIROMO: I love what you said earlier, that you think that this is going to be another couple years of this economic expansion. Now, here we are in year 11. So that's a good backdrop for stocks.BANKS: Well, it's interesting. There's -- the excesses aren't building, right. Inflation is low, going lower, rates are going lower, consumer sentiment is strong. None of the things that typically tip over the economy -- old age doesn't do. Old age tips us over, it doesn't tip markets over. People have to remember that. That's what we got to keep an eye on.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: You like the market.BANKS: Yes.BARTIROMO: Keith -- it's good to see you.BANKS: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Keith Banks joining us there, Bank of America.We will have special coverage here on Fox Business of the Federal Reserve decision today at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. Join us.

Wait until you hear this. Is it moral? We've got that debate coming up.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 31st. Your stop stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.Investors across the world keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve today and the decision on interest rates along with a string of earnings for the second quarter.Markets are higher, we're at the highs of the morning right here, markets getting a big push from Apple with the Dow Jones Futures up 74 points, quarter of a percent, the S&P Futures up six and the NASDAQ Futures higher by 30 points.General Electric out with a double beat and it is also raising its profit outlook as you see, G.E. shares were up 4-1/2 percent. Humana seeing a jump in revenue, raising its full year guidance as well. Humana share up 2-3/4 percent.Yesterday, stocks slipped after President Trump said that China trade talks are basically slow and saying that China does not come through on its agreements. It -- he warned China not to wait for the 2020 election to do a deal. He says it will be tougher then.Global markets this morning are lower -- well, that was yesterday's trade. As you can see, the Dow yesterday was down 23 and the S&P was down seven. The NASDAQ was lower by 19 points.Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at European indices where the consumer is strong in Germany apparently, retail sales posted the biggest monthly jump in Germany since December 06 and the DAX Index is up 27 points, quarter of a percent. The FT-100 in London is down 50 points and the CAC Quarante in Paris is up five.In Asia overnight, declines across the board. There is also more signs of slowdown in China.

We've got a look at the top moments from last night's big debate and anticipating tonight.The high cost of higher education meanwhile, parents are taking some extreme measures to get a break on tuition. Giving up guardianship of their kids.Plus this, valuable life lessons from Monopoly. The hilarious video that captures a young boy feeling the pain of taxes. Yes, we feel your pain.All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, the Democratic debate. 10 2020 candidates going head-to-head last night during night one of a second set ready to face-off tonight, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So again, I think if we're going to force Americans to make these radical changes, they're not going to go along and you -- throw your hands up. But you have -- you have --SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All right.HICKENLOOPER: Oh-ho, I can do it. But you haven't implement the plan. You can't just spring a plan on the world and expect it to succeed.REP. JOHN DELANEY (D-MD), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So -- so I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions, not impossible promises, when we run on things that are workable, not fairy tale economics.SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, I don't understand why anybody does to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the co-host of "THE FIVE", Juan Williams. Juan, great to see you.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good morning.BARTIROMO: How was the debate from your standpoint?WILLIAMS: I think wait as success for the Democrats overall because I thought it was a real debate about real issues and what you were able to see is the moderate wing of the party versus the more liberal progressive wing of the party versus the more liberal progressive wing of the party. And what happened there I think was not only illuminating if you were watching but you saw for example the debate about Medicare for All play out in a way that I thought people could understand, appreciate and decide who they wanted to back.But the bigger point is I think that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders who going into this were positive as potentially fighting each other for the left lane of the party. Actually, were unified and unified against the more conservative Democrats who were on the stage.BARTIROMO: Yes, like Tim Ryan or Delaney.WILLIAMS: Yes, I thought -- I thought Tim Ryan did pretty well from south. Delaney on the other hand, I think he disappeared. And of course he had that moment with the hands in the air business that I don't think worked for him. But that was -- that's the only memorable moment he had from last night.BARTIROMO: You don't think that -- it worked for Hickenlooper? You don't --WILLIAMS: Correct, I don't think it worked for Hickenlooper at all.BARTIROMO: OK.MATT MURRAY, EDITOR IN CHIEF, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, Juan, how worried do you think Democrats are getting about electability? Because it was striking. In the first set of debates it was sort of a march to the left. Everybody topping each other. Here you had very clear lines with moderates really kind of arguing we're not going to beat the president with these policies and Warren and Sanders as you say, kind of allied and going further and farther.How much concern does that reflect in the Democratic Party right now about how the race is going and about the chances of beating the president?WILLIAMS: I think that there's a pretty strong sense that you can beat the president but the argument is do you do this with a vision that? Do you have to say here's what I see beyond President Trump? Or do you simply say, as you suggest with your question, that I can beat President Trump and this is where tonight we're going to see a little bit of this with Joe Biden, the former vice president. Is Biden simply saying I'll take us back to the point before Donald Trump, when things weren't normal? You didn't wake up to a Twitter storm on MORNINGS WITH MARIA where you didn't have this kind of racial divisiveness being sold to the country.You know, is that enough or do you want to say, hi, no, I think we can do better. We can do better for the working people in this country. We can do better in terms of healthcare where so many people don't have coverage or being bankrupted. We can do better in terms of helping our kids who are burdened by high school tuition debt.BELL: Well, I have a question. Cardi B has come out kind of as a wild card. She is now out there being very vocal about getting to know your Democratic primary candidates. And she had a sit-down with Bernie Sanders. How do you think her in getting involved is going to play out for these candidates?WILLIAMS: I think you should answer this question. You're the young person on this panel. Because you know what, so for people like me, I'm -- you know, I used to cover campaigns for a living. And you go out and you have a 24 hour news cycle. And then you, you know, turn in the morning shows or the morning paper, Matt's morning Wall Street Journal.But now, Cardi B does something with Bernie Sanders, it gets 2.5 million people to pick it up. You think --BARTIROMO: That's unbelievable.WILLIAMS: -- wait a minute, who are these people and do they vote and do they give money? I don't know the answers yet. Because my experience as a political journalist, I'm like, wow, hold on, I understand we're playing a different game. Obviously Donald Trump got this way before I did. He plays that Twitter game too, but this is like unbelievable. And so, she has not even endorsed Bernie Sanders but her actions --MCDOWELL: And she wouldn't -- and she wouldn't, and I'll tell you why.WILLIAMS: Go right ahead.MCDOWELL: Because in the past, it must have been in the last year, she did a video online on social media that said I don't know why my friends in the music industry have to pay so much in taxes.You know, we have short-lived careers in music and we have all these people, all these family members that we need to support and we're handing over more than half our money to the government in taxes. So again, she could -- she could come at -- come at these candidates the way they might not be expecting. She seems to be -- she has a very real world look at taxation in this country. She --BARTIROMO: Yes, I had forgotten that. You're right. That was a good moment.MCDOWELL: And it was -- but it was -- she's very, very smart and very savvy and she came at it from that.But I want to ask you, though, ultimately Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have to justify taking private health insurance away from 180 million people and they have to convince people that the government and bureaucrats somehow are going to deliver better health coverage than private companies. And I think that that is a long, long way to go on that.WILLIAMS: I think they did very well on just that point last night when they pointed out that -- and Bernie said this explicitly, you're going to have to pay less in terms of deductibles, less in terms of coverage. And it will compensate --BARTIROMO: Yes, but it blow off the question about raising taxes on the middle class (INAUDIBLE).WILLIAMS: No, because it said that in fact, you would benefit more. The average American middles class family is going to benefit more from Medicaid for All than from the current tax structure.No, and in respond to your point, --MCDOWELL: But he didn't have --WILLIAMS: -- that's what the private insurers that are there now are the ones that as Bernie says are ripping off people, making huge profits whilst large numbers of people go uncovered or inadequately covered.MCDOWELL: Juan, they need to explain to people how they're going to deliver this when Medicare as we know it is going broke. The Medicare hospital trust fund goes broke in less than seven years, in 2026. People benefits will immediately get cut to $0.89 on the dollar, danger.He's not in favor of fixing that. He wants to rip the entire thing up. And ultimately it's going to wind up with price controls and rationing. And if you have anything else wrong with you other than an ear infection and need antibiotic, you are going to have to wait months for coverage. And it's --WILLIAMS: That's a -- that's scare language. That's kind of fear mongering.MCDOWELL: No it's not, it's a fact.WILLIAMS: Because what Bernie said in response to your point would be, you need structural change. And this comes back to what Matt and I were talking about at the time. If you believe in a vision beyond the status quo, will that sell to voters or you just -- do you simply have to say, boy, this Donald Trump guy is kind of off the rail.MCDOWELL: When government was in charge of people's healthcare, you had individuals in this country who were mentally disabled being sterilized by states across the country. That only --WILLIAMS: How is that relevant to this (INAUDIBLE)?MCDOWELL: Because you know what, when the government takes over healthcare, that's what happens. It was 1979 is when it ended.BARTIROMO: It's about government wanting your healthcare. And the government putting in a major, big federal program and doing away with 180 million people's healthcare plans --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I'm talking to now small government conservatives, the two of you.BARTIROMO: That's right.WILLIAMS: And I guess you back to Donald Trump's budget which is that big government big standing budget.BARTIROMO: No, that has nothing to do with this conversation.WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying, there's some kind of hypocrisy on among the right --MCDOWELL: No, you need to watch her show.BARTIROMO: You need to watch this program.WILLIAMS: Because there's hypocrisy --BARTIROMO: I (INAUDIBLE) big federal programs every day and how they're bad.WILLIAMS: Right, so you know what, who --BARTIROMO: Look at the Post Office.WILLIAMS: What happened here, Mitch McConnell, the Republicans, they backed this budget, didn't they? Big spending, big deficits.BARTIROMO: Well, the Dems -- the Dems wanted all that discretionary spending.WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. And Donald Trump did what?BARTIROMO: They won't allow the Republicans to protect the military so that they can have --WILLIAMS: What did Maria do on -- Maria, what did Donald Trump do on taxes? He raised taxes that benefited the rich in this country and took away revenue.BARTIROMO: Every income level went down in terms of taxes, Juan, you know this and they doubled the standard deduction. Every single income went down.WILLIAMS: Overwhelming, I think it's like 25 percent of the benefit of that tax cut went to the one percent and you're saying, oh, we can't afford to help out people who need help here.BARTIROMO: And last -- and last year we got a quarter -- and last year we got a quarter better than four percent growth.WILLIAMS: Yes.BARTIROMO: And this year we got 3.1 percent growth in the first quarter and 3.1 percent growth in the second quarter.WILLIAMS: Oh, my guys, (INAUDIBLE). I think we can afford to help people if we --BARTIROMO: The tax cut legislation has moved the needle on economic growth, Juan. You have to admit that.WILLIAMS: It hasn't moved a needle. We are talking about healthcare. We're talking about education. We're talking about a vision for America and you guys say, oh, we can't afford it, but we can give tax cuts to the rich. Oh, we can do this.BARTIROMO: Should we go back to the under two percent growth under Barack Obama for eight years?WILLIAMS: How about consistent growth that right now is setting records and has the stock market at (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: Sounds like we got it -- sounds like we got it.WILLIAMS: Yes, and we can -- it as an affluent society afford to help people.BARTIROMO: Well, deregulation, a little tax cuts. You get some economic growth from there, wow.WILLIAMS: Let's have an election -- let's have an election.BARTIROMO: Look how that happens.MCDOWELL: Wages are growing faster than we even expected. If you were a numbers nerd like me, you would have been reading the Bureau of Economic -- Bureau of Economic Analysis.BARTIROMO: That's right.WILLIAMS: You know what -- you know what -- you know what you should be saying, Dagen? Thank you, Obama, thank you.BARTIROMO: Oh, come on, Juan.WILLIAMS: That's the fact.MCDOWELL: And by the way --BARTIROMO: It's not a fact at all. (INAUDIBLE)WILLIAMS: It is the fact.BARTIROMO: Nothing happened until Donald Trump got in there and started moving things around in terms of economic policy, you know that.WILLIAMS: It's just doing great.BARTIROMO: Deregulation, tax cuts, opened up the spigots on oil production. Come on.WILLIAMS: It's doing so great, the Fed -- the Fed doesn't have to raise anything today, it doesn't have to help us. No, no, no, things are just going great.BARTIROMO: Juan, thank you. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A little boy learning a big life lesson. Courtesy of the game Monopoly. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: OK, so this is a viral video we're going to show you. A young boy loses it when Monopoly teaches him a really hard lesson about life and money.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where's all your money gone, Bobby?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taxes. It's the worst part of the game.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is what?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taxes.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: We feel your pain, honey. The now viral post first went up on Reddit. Many on social media clearly relating to the kids woes, expressing sympathy for his big losses. And you know what, we should add here Maria that, you know, this is actually the way you play Monopoly if you play it in the correct way and there is an income tax.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) I never paid taxes.CASONE: Then well, you're cheating.BARTIROMO: Come on.CASONE: That's you know, there is an income if you played the game in the real way, you're supposed to. There's an income tax hit on the board and you either pay the bank or you -- or you fork over 10 percent.BARTIROMO: Oh, you're right. You have to land on it.CASONE: You have to land on it.BARTIROMO: That I know.CASONE: So he got hit by the taxes, he wasn't very happy about it.BARTIROMO: I love it. Thank you, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: I wish Juan was here, we need Juan Williams back on that. Thank you, Cheryl.Coming up, the high cost of college, some parents are going to the extreme. Making sure the tuition bill gets paid. Why it's sparking a morality debate around that. Next up, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The high cost of college, the Wall Street Journal highlighting an option some parents are using, bending the rules to get that tuition bill paid up, giving up custody of their kids to get more financial aid.Joining us right now, University of Maryland professor Emeritus and columnist Peter Morici. And it's great to see you, Peter. Thank you so much for being here.PETER MORICI, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: Nice to be with you.BARTIROMO: Well, this is pretty extreme.MORICI: Oh, absolutely. But it's not novel. I mean, going back to the 60s when I was a kid in school, there were people who would try to become financially independent of their parents or at least claim independence to max their financial aid. This is a different wrinkle, you sign over custody to a poorer relative.I think we need to say that this is wrong but also to look at it in the context of the recent admissions scandal and ask why are parents going to such extremes? And I think the answer is the way colleges and universities treat them. Frankly, very cynically.They do a lot of differential pricing. They do a lot of price gouging. They have bloated bureaucracies. They're terribly high cost operations. You know, I often think the healthcare mess has a purpose, it's to keep the spotlight off of people like me.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, you make a good point in terms of what colleges are doing to encourage this. Matt, talk about the story in the Journal in terms of what's being done out there.MURRAY: So, it was a story that really came out of Illinois where we noticed that there were a spike in guardianship requests and tracked down the colleges. It's got the University of Illinois very concerned. We talked to the admission folks there.This is a new tactic, in the suburbs of Chicago. And it's -- a lot of these families who, you know, their income is good, would put them fairly high but the cost of college is so high, they've got three or four kids that some of them are deploying this tactic.There's actually supposed to be a college counselor out there in Illinois who's advising people that this is a smart strategy to use.BARTIROMO: OK.MURRAY: So the idea's gotten out there. And you know, I think -- I think what Peter said is interesting, because navigating college for your kid is one of the most complicated, gut-wrenching, challenging things for any family, wealthy or not.Although, it is true that wealthy people are learning the game the system pretty aggressively for their kids in a way that seems very unfair to others, especially because these programs are really there to help kids who can't afford college.BARTIROMO: Yes, as Peter, you just said, it's not right.Meanwhile, Peter -- billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel joined Tucker Carlson last night with a different take on elite institutions and their tax exempt status. Listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER THIEL, CO-FOUNDER, PAYPAL: If the elite colleges were educating people, if Harvard or Stanford were educating people, and giving them a great education, they should be just doubling or tripling the enrollment. And what sort of business is doing something great for its customers and doesn't increase the number of its customers. That's a really weird business.But the closest analogy in business I can come up with is that it's something like the Studio 54 Nightclub. You have an incredibly long line outside, only a few people get in and the value comes from being exclusionary. They're not inclusive, they're exclusionary, and that's where the value comes from.TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: And a highly self-satisfied bouncer.THIEL: And then if you think of it as the Stanford or Yale or Harvard, Studio 54 Nightclub that you're running, it's perhaps good for the prestige and status of the students. Maybe it's bad for their morals but it certainly doesn't deserve a tax exemption.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Peter, your thoughts. Obviously you know, you're making choices there and a lot of people are getting hurt.MORICI: Well, the reality is that you talk about university enrolment, most universities don't want to have really huge undergraduate enrolments. The state university like the one I taught at has to have a large undergraduate enrolment. That's our mandate.But a place like Harvard or Cornell or Columbia or what have you, the Ivies, Northwestern and so forth.BARTIROMO: Right.MORICI: They have to -- they see themselves more as research institutions, with large endowments that can devote themselves to PhD students and granting MBAs and things of that nature. Many of those activities MBAs being an exception are not particularly profitable but their endowments provide for it.BARTIROMO: Right.MORICI: They're not particularly interested in having, you know, 20,000 undergraduates at Harvard.BARTIROMO: Yes, they want to be exclusionary, exactly. Peter, its good --MORICI: Well, it's not only that. It's what they want to do with their faculty.BARTIROMO: Right. Peter, it's good to see you. Thank you so much. Peter Morici, joining us there.Stay with us, we've got the ADP number coming out and then U.S.-China trade talks. Back in a minute.Load-Date: July 31, 2019End of Document

China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.Weakness has come from the the S&P 500 energy (-0.9%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.6%) sectors. Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a x% drop in shares of General Electric (-x%). GE has nearly doubled its losses since the last update.The tech sector has been dragged lower by shares of Apple (AAPL 200.74, -1.97, -1.0%), Microsoft (MFST 132.79, -1.18, -0.9%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.86, -3.75, -7.4%) -- the latter of which remains noticeably lower following its disappointing guidance.10:55 ETDow +66.58 at 25545.98, Nasdaq +13.34 at 7787.29, S&P +11.44 at 2852.04[BRIEFING.COM] The market has been clinging onto modest gains today, although the price action has not been very convincing. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.Overnight, the futures market was signaling more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept. 1. China did soften its stance later, saying it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks but this is a line it has been saying for quite some time now.In other earnings news, Tapestry (TPR 20.30, -4.70, -18.8%) shares have plunged nearly 20% after the company missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter and the rest of its fiscal year.10:25 ETDow +66.28 at 25545.68, Nasdaq +19.73 at 7793.68, S&P +12.09 at 2852.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%.Dow components Walmart (WMT 111.14, +4.94, +4.7%) and Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.32, -3.30, -6.5%) have been in focus today after releasing their earnings reports. Walmart provided solid quarterly results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, while Cisco Systems guided its fiscal Q1 EPS and revenue below consensus.General Electric (GE 8.42, -0.61, -6.8%) has also received plenty of attention today, with shares down nearly 7% after whistleblower Harry Markopolos labeled GE a "Bigger Fraud Than Enron" in a critical report on GE's accounting.10:00 ETDow +78.14 at 25557.54, Nasdaq +13.54 at 7787.49, S&P +9.58 at 2850.18[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Business inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%). The May reading was unrevised at 0.3%.Earlier, industrial production for July declined 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) following an revised increase of 0.2% in June (from 0.0%). Capacity utilization decreased to 77.5% in July (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from 77.8% in June (revised from 77.9%).09:45 ETDow -39.74 at 25439.66, Nasdaq -28.99 at 7744.96, S&P -5.45 at 2835.15[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower after their worst performance of the year yesterday. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sector standings shows consumer staples (+0.7%) and financials (+0.6%) providing some support for the broader market. Conversely, the energy (-0.8%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors have been influential laggards.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.55%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.99. WTI crude is down 1.6% to $54.34/bbl.09:13 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +43.80.The stock market is on pace to open higher following positive results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 113.24, +7.04, +6.6%) and encouraging economic data. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.58%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.94.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +16.40.

The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

There has been no meaningful attempt to rebound from yesterday's 3% sell-off.Shares of American Airlines (AAL 25.28, -0.82) have dropped 3.2% on no confirmed news catalyst today. The company, which is a part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (-0.8%), is one of many stocks within that group to trade lower.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.7%, UK's FTSE lost 1.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.3%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.3%.11:25 ETDow -9.82 at 25469.58, Nasdaq -23.94 at 7750.01, S&P -2.85 at 2837.75[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dipped back into the red. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.Weakness has come from the S&P 500 energy (-0.9%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.6%) sectors. Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices ($54.69, -0.54, -1.0%) continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a 12.4% drop in shares of General Electric (7.95, -1.08). GE has nearly doubled its losses since the last update.The tech sector has been dragged lower by shares of Apple (AAPL 200.74, -1.97, -1.0%), Microsoft (MFST 132.79, -1.18, -0.9%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.86, -3.75, -7.4%) -- the latter of which remains noticeably lower following its disappointing guidance.10:55 ETDow +66.58 at 25545.98, Nasdaq +13.34 at 7787.29, S&P +11.44 at 2852.04[BRIEFING.COM] The market has been clinging onto modest gains today, although the price action has not been very convincing. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.Overnight, the futures market was signaling more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept. 1. China did soften its stance later, saying it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks but this is a line it has been saying for quite some time now.In other earnings news, Tapestry (TPR 20.30, -4.70, -18.8%) shares have plunged nearly 20% after the company missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter and the rest of its fiscal year.10:25 ETDow +66.28 at 25545.68, Nasdaq +19.73 at 7793.68, S&P +12.09 at 2852.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%.Dow components Walmart (WMT 111.14, +4.94, +4.7%) and Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.32, -3.30, -6.5%) have been in focus today after releasing their earnings reports. Walmart provided solid quarterly results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, while Cisco Systems guided its fiscal Q1 EPS and revenue below consensus.General Electric (GE 8.42, -0.61, -6.8%) has also received plenty of attention today, with shares down nearly 7% after whistleblower Harry Markopolos labeled GE a "Bigger Fraud Than Enron" in a critical report on GE's accounting.10:00 ETDow +78.14 at 25557.54, Nasdaq +13.54 at 7787.49, S&P +9.58 at 2850.18[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Business inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%). The May reading was unrevised at 0.3%.Earlier, industrial production for July declined 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) following an revised increase of 0.2% in June (from 0.0%). Capacity utilization decreased to 77.5% in July (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from 77.8% in June (revised from 77.9%).09:45 ETDow -39.74 at 25439.66, Nasdaq -28.99 at 7744.96, S&P -5.45 at 2835.15[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower after their worst performance of the year yesterday. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sector standings shows consumer staples (+0.7%) and financials (+0.6%) providing some support for the broader market. Conversely, the energy (-0.8%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors have been influential laggards.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.55%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.99. WTI crude is down 1.6% to $54.34/bbl.09:13 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +43.80.The stock market is on pace to open higher following positive results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 113.24, +7.04, +6.6%) and encouraging economic data. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.58%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.94.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +16.40.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +23.30.The S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session. Futures were pulled lower after China threatened to retaliate against the upcoming 10% tariff rate on Chinese imports, but solid results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 112.71, +6.51, +6.1%) has lifted futures back into positive territory.The market is presumably trying to find its footing after a sharp 3% sell-off yesterday that was attributed to recessionary fears. China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July.

Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices ($54.69, -0.54, -1.0%) continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a 12.4% drop in shares of General Electric (7.95, -1.08). GE has nearly doubled its losses since the last update.The tech sector has been dragged lower by shares of Apple (AAPL 200.74, -1.97, -1.0%), Microsoft (MFST 132.79, -1.18, -0.9%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.86, -3.75, -7.4%) -- the latter of which remains noticeably lower following its disappointing guidance.10:55 ETDow +66.58 at 25545.98, Nasdaq +13.34 at 7787.29, S&P +11.44 at 2852.04[BRIEFING.COM] The market has been clinging onto modest gains today, although the price action has not been very convincing. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.Overnight, the futures market was signaling more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept. 1. China did soften its stance later, saying it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks but this is a line it has been saying for quite some time now.In other earnings news, Tapestry (TPR 20.30, -4.70, -18.8%) shares have plunged nearly 20% after the company missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter and the rest of its fiscal year.10:25 ETDow +66.28 at 25545.68, Nasdaq +19.73 at 7793.68, S&P +12.09 at 2852.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%.Dow components Walmart (WMT 111.14, +4.94, +4.7%) and Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.32, -3.30, -6.5%) have been in focus today after releasing their earnings reports. Walmart provided solid quarterly results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, while Cisco Systems guided its fiscal Q1 EPS and revenue below consensus.General Electric (GE 8.42, -0.61, -6.8%) has also received plenty of attention today, with shares down nearly 7% after whistleblower Harry Markopolos labeled GE a "Bigger Fraud Than Enron" in a critical report on GE's accounting.10:00 ETDow +78.14 at 25557.54, Nasdaq +13.54 at 7787.49, S&P +9.58 at 2850.18[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Business inventories were unchanged in June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%).

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sector standings shows consumer staples (+0.7%) and financials (+0.6%) providing some support for the broader market. Conversely, the energy (-0.8%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors have been influential laggards.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.55%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.99.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +43.80.The stock market is on pace to open higher following positive results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 113.24, +7.04, +6.6%) and encouraging economic data. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.58%.

Futures were pulled lower after China threatened to retaliate against the upcoming 10% tariff rate on Chinese imports, but solid results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 112.71, +6.51, +6.1%) has lifted futures back into positive territory.The market is presumably trying to find its footing after a sharp 3% sell-off yesterday that was attributed to recessionary fears. China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 200 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.Weakness has come from the S&P 500 energy (-0.9%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.6%) sectors. Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices ($54.69, -0.54, -1.0%) continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a 12.4% drop in shares of General Electric (7.95, -1.08). GE has nearly doubled its losses since the last update.The tech sector has been dragged lower by shares of Apple (AAPL 200.74, -1.97, -1.0%), Microsoft (MFST 132.79, -1.18, -0.9%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.86, -3.75, -7.4%) -- the latter of which remains noticeably lower following its disappointing guidance.10:55 ETDow +66.58 at 25545.98, Nasdaq +13.34 at 7787.29, S&P +11.44 at 2852.04[BRIEFING.COM] The market has been clinging onto modest gains today, although the price action has not been very convincing. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.Overnight, the futures market was signaling more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept. 1. China did soften its stance later, saying it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks but this is a line it has been saying for quite some time now.In other earnings news, Tapestry (TPR 20.30, -4.70, -18.8%) shares have plunged nearly 20% after the company missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter and the rest of its fiscal year.10:25 ETDow +66.28 at 25545.68, Nasdaq +19.73 at 7793.68, S&P +12.09 at 2852.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%.Dow components Walmart (WMT 111.14, +4.94, +4.7%) and Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.32, -3.30, -6.5%) have been in focus today after releasing their earnings reports.

The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks.

Futures were pulled lower after China threatened to retaliate against the upcoming 10% tariff rate on Chinese imports, but solid results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 112.71, +6.51, +6.1%) has lifted futures back into positive territory.The market is presumably trying to find its footing after a sharp 3% sell-off yesterday that was attributed to recessionary fears. China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

WMT's widely-covered gains today stem from this morning's results and guidance, while BA & V move higher as the general recovery in the broader markets trickles down.Conversely, technology giant Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.53, -4.08, -8.06%) still sits at the bottom of the index following last night's underwhelming guidance.Today's modest recovery in the DJIA has the index about 4.94% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +50.14 at 25529.54, Nasdaq -7.97 at 7765.98, S&P +4.42 at 2845.02[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a mixed session that has included its fair share of trade headlines, corporate news, and economic data. Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results.

There has been no meaningful attempt to rebound from yesterday's 3% sell-off.Shares of American Airlines (AAL 25.28, -0.82) have dropped 3.2% on no confirmed news catalyst today. The company, which is a part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (-0.8%), is one of many stocks within that group to trade lower.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.7%, UK's FTSE lost 1.1%, and France's CAC lost 0.3%.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.Weakness has come from the S&P 500 energy (-0.9%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.6%) sectors. Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices ($54.69, -0.54, -1.0%) continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a 12.4% drop in shares of General Electric (7.95, -1.08). GE has nearly doubled its losses since the last update.The tech sector has been dragged lower by shares of Apple (AAPL 200.74, -1.97, -1.0%), Microsoft (MFST 132.79, -1.18, -0.9%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.86, -3.75, -7.4%) -- the latter of which remains noticeably lower following its disappointing guidance.10:55 ETDow +66.58 at 25545.98, Nasdaq +13.34 at 7787.29, S&P +11.44 at 2852.04[BRIEFING.COM] The market has been clinging onto modest gains today, although the price action has not been very convincing. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.Overnight, the futures market was signaling more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept. 1. China did soften its stance later, saying it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks but this is a line it has been saying for quite some time now.In other earnings news, Tapestry (TPR 20.30, -4.70, -18.8%) shares have plunged nearly 20% after the company missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter and the rest of its fiscal year.10:25 ETDow +66.28 at 25545.68, Nasdaq +19.73 at 7793.68, S&P +12.09 at 2852.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%.Dow components Walmart (WMT 111.14, +4.94, +4.7%) and Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.32, -3.30, -6.5%) have been in focus today after releasing their earnings reports.

The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks.

Futures were pulled lower after China threatened to retaliate against the upcoming 10% tariff rate on Chinese imports, but solid results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 112.71, +6.51, +6.1%) has lifted futures back into positive territory.The market is presumably trying to find its footing after a sharp 3% sell-off yesterday that was attributed to recessionary fears. China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

WMT's widely-covered gains today stem from this morning's results and guidance, while BA & V move higher as the general recovery in the broader markets trickles down.Conversely, technology giant Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.53, -4.08, -8.06%) still sits at the bottom of the index following last night's underwhelming guidance.Today's modest recovery in the DJIA has the index about 4.94% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +50.14 at 25529.54, Nasdaq -7.97 at 7765.98, S&P +4.42 at 2845.02[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a mixed session that has included its fair share of trade headlines, corporate news, and economic data. Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results.

There has been no meaningful attempt to rebound from yesterday's 3% sell-off.Shares of American Airlines (AAL 25.28, -0.82) have dropped 3.2% on no confirmed news catalyst today. The company, which is a part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (-0.8%), is one of many stocks within that group to trade lower.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a lower note.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.Weakness has come from the S&P 500 energy (-0.9%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.6%) sectors. Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices ($54.69, -0.54, -1.0%) continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a 12.4% drop in shares of General Electric (7.95, -1.08). GE has nearly doubled its losses since the last update.The tech sector has been dragged lower by shares of Apple (AAPL 200.74, -1.97, -1.0%), Microsoft (MFST 132.79, -1.18, -0.9%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.86, -3.75, -7.4%) -- the latter of which remains noticeably lower following its disappointing guidance.10:55 ETDow +66.58 at 25545.98, Nasdaq +13.34 at 7787.29, S&P +11.44 at 2852.04[BRIEFING.COM] The market has been clinging onto modest gains today, although the price action has not been very convincing.

China did soften its stance later, saying it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks but this is a line it has been saying for quite some time now.In other earnings news, Tapestry (TPR 20.30, -4.70, -18.8%) shares have plunged nearly 20% after the company missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter and the rest of its fiscal year.10:25 ETDow +66.28 at 25545.68, Nasdaq +19.73 at 7793.68, S&P +12.09 at 2852.69[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.5%.Dow components Walmart (WMT 111.14, +4.94, +4.7%) and Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.32, -3.30, -6.5%) have been in focus today after releasing their earnings reports.

The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks.

Futures were pulled lower after China threatened to retaliate against the upcoming 10% tariff rate on Chinese imports, but solid results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 112.71, +6.51, +6.1%) has lifted futures back into positive territory.The market is presumably trying to find its footing after a sharp 3% sell-off yesterday that was attributed to recessionary fears. China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

WMT's widely-covered gains today stem from this morning's results and guidance, while BA & V move higher as the general recovery in the broader markets trickles down.Conversely, technology giant Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.53, -4.08, -8.06%) still sits at the bottom of the index following last night's underwhelming guidance.Today's modest recovery in the DJIA has the index about 4.94% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +50.14 at 25529.54, Nasdaq -7.97 at 7765.98, S&P +4.42 at 2845.02[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a mixed session that has included its fair share of trade headlines, corporate news, and economic data. Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results.

There has been no meaningful attempt to rebound from yesterday's 3% sell-off.Shares of American Airlines (AAL 25.28, -0.82) have dropped 3.2% on no confirmed news catalyst today.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.Weakness has come from the S&P 500 energy (-0.9%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.6%) sectors. Energy stocks remain under pressure as oil prices ($54.69, -0.54, -1.0%) continue to retreat, while the industrials sector has been weighed down by a 12.4% drop in shares of General Electric (7.95, -1.08).

More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks.

Futures were pulled lower after China threatened to retaliate against the upcoming 10% tariff rate on Chinese imports, but solid results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 112.71, +6.51, +6.1%) has lifted futures back into positive territory.The market is presumably trying to find its footing after a sharp 3% sell-off yesterday that was attributed to recessionary fears. China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

WMT's widely-covered gains today stem from this morning's results and guidance, while BA & V move higher as the general recovery in the broader markets trickles down.Conversely, technology giant Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.53, -4.08, -8.06%) still sits at the bottom of the index following last night's underwhelming guidance.Today's modest recovery in the DJIA has the index about 4.94% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +50.14 at 25529.54, Nasdaq -7.97 at 7765.98, S&P +4.42 at 2845.02[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a mixed session that has included its fair share of trade headlines, corporate news, and economic data. Today's price action hasn't been too convincing, though, as none of these events has provided the market any new revelations since yesterday's 3% sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.Prior to the session, the futures market was signaling for more losses at the open after China vowed countermeasures against the 10% tariff rate that is set to go into effect Sept 1. Disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.54, -4.05, -8.0%) added to the negative disposition.The following news, however, have helped the broader market regain some composure today: Walmart (WMT 110.99, +4.79, +4.5%) provided solid results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, July retail sales rose 0.7% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and China said it hopes the U.S. can meet it halfway in trade talks (which it has said before).At this juncture, leadership has been concentrated among the defensive-oriented S&P 500 sectors -- consumer staples (+1.3%), real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%). Conversely, the cyclical energy (-0.5%), industrials (-0.3%), information technology (-0.2%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors trade lower.General Electric (GE 7.95, -1.07, -11.9%) has largely accounted for the weakness in the industrials sector, as shares fall more than 10% following a critical report from Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos. The report labeled GE a "bigger fraud than Enron."Essentially, the market appears to be tilting positive on reassurance that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, while hoping that trade relations can improve despite no evidence to suggest otherwise. There remains underlying growth concerns, though, evidenced by lower oil prices ($54.42, -0.81, -1.5%) and the continued flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, which has driven yields lower again.The 2-yr yield is down eight basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield is down five basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.18.Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data:Retail sales increased 0.7% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and were up 1.0%, excluding autos (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The key takeaway from the report is that it offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape, which is key to fending off a recession.Initial claims for the week ending August 10 increased by 9,000 to 220,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending August 3 jumped by 39,000 to 1.726 million.The key takeaway from the report is that there wasn't any meaningful shift in the underlying trend (which is solid) for initial claims, as the four-week moving average moved up just 1,000 to a low 213,750.Nonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) after increasing a revised 3.5% in Q1 (from 3.4%), according to the preliminary reading. Unit labor costs increased 2.4% in the second quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) after increasing a revised 5.5% (from -1.6%) in Q1.The key takeaway from the report is the improved trend in productivity, which was up 1.8% from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 versus the annual average of 1.3% for 2018 and 2017, and 0.3% in 2016.Industrial production decreased 0.2% in July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) after increasing a revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in June. The total industry capacity utilization rate fell to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) from a revised 77.8% (from 77.9%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the July decrease in industrial production has reduced the yr/yr growth rate to just 0.5%.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August increased to 4.8 (Briefing.com consensus 1.1) from the prior month's reading of 4.3.The Philadelphia Fed Index for August came in at 16.8 (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), below the 21.8 reading in July. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1601/1219. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1409/1556.12:30 ETDow +93.30 at 25572.7, Nasdaq +5.19 at 7779.14, S&P +9.63 at 2850.23[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.1%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

Sense of the Markets: Hong Kong at a CrossroadsThe Deal PipelineAugust 23, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 The Deal, L.L.C. All Rights ReservedLength: 727 wordsByline: by Paul WhitfieldBodyHong Kong s protestors had blockaded streets, cancelled trains and grounded planes, but until this week had done little to hit Asia s biggest financial center where it really hurts by stemming capital flows. That appears to have changed after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA), China s biggest e-commerce company, was reported to have delayed an about $15 billion listing on Hong Kong s stock exchange. The public offering had been penciled in, though never officially confirmed, for later this month. It now won t happen until at least October and then only if political tensions have calmed, according to a report by Reuters.The delay of a share sale isn t as eye catching as two million Hong Kongers flooding the streets during the biggest protest on June 16, or dazed travelers making their way around barricades of airport trollies earlier this month, but it is a symbolically important blow to Hong Kong s stock market and by proxy the special administrative region's leadership.Alibaba's listing had been set to be the saving grace for Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., Hong Kong s market operator, after a disappointing year in which it had already lost one mega IPO, when Anheuser-Busch InBev NV/SA pulled a $9.8 billion sale of its Asian unit, and is set to lose its crown as the biggest destination for new listings. The New York Stock Exchange raised almost twice from new listings as much as Hong Kong over the first half of 2019.The latest setback, even if it proves temporary, also portents Beijing s wavering faith that Hong Kong s leaders can quickly bring the protesters to heal.The tech giant isn t controlled by the Chinese government, but like many large mainland-based Chinese companies arguably feels Beijing s hand on its shoulder. The company s decision to list in Hong Kong may have been a natural choice for a technology company seeking to honor its Chinese heritage and access a deep and wide investment pool; but it was also a gesture that Beijing was willing to entrust one of its crown jewels to Hong Kong s more liberal and open regime.It is impossible not to view the listing s suspension as a rebuke to the Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam and her failure to quickly quell the region's months-long discontent.That could encourage the protestors, whose numbers have diminished in recent weeks, but whose tactics, including the politically embarrassing and economically damaging blockade of Hong Kong airport, have become bolder. There can be no guarantees that Hong Kong will be calm come October, in which case Alibaba s revised timetable may need further revision.Weeks or months of further protest would test the patience of Beijing. Yet China s President Xi Jingping has few good options in terms of a response. Troops might calm the streets but would have a chilling effect on the Hong Kong's attractiveness as a destination for international business, particularly if it involved elements of China s regular army.It would also further rattle the about 1,500 multinationals that have their regional headquarters in Hong Kong.Some of them will already be alarmed at the Chinese government s more circuitous interventions, including the ushering out of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. s well-respected CEO Rupert Hogg. Hogg resigned on Aug. 16, weeks after his company initially refused to forbid staff to take part in protests, and days after British billionaire Merlin Swire, Chairman of Cathay s controlling shareholder Swire Pacific Ltd. was summoned to a meeting with Beijing.There are still good options for the Chinese government, though they all start with Beijing sitting on its hands and allowing Hong Kong to methodically, and messily, works through its issues.  Hong Kong's value to international companies, and thus to China, is based on faith that its robust legal system, inherited from its period as a British territory, and entrenched financial checks and balances provide certainty of the sort that many investors remain skeptical of across the border. Eroding that belief, whether by leaning on recalcitrant executives or sending in troops, will serve to make permanent whatever damage has already been done to Hong Kong s reputation by the protests.Without cool heads there could ultimately be little reason for Alibaba, or any other corporate giant, to want to come to Hong Kong.DEAL SIZE$ 10-50 BillionLoad-Date: August 27, 2019End of Document

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sector standings shows consumer staples (+0.7%) and financials (+0.6%) providing some support for the broader market. Conversely, the energy (-0.8%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors have been influential laggards.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.55%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.99.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +43.80.The stock market is on pace to open higher following positive results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 113.24, +7.04, +6.6%) and encouraging economic data. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.58%.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, above fair value in a volatile pre-market session.Walmart's impressive results and confidence, coupled with a 0.7% increase in July retail sales (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), has reassured the market that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape. More so, it has helped the market overlook possible Chinese retaliation against the upcoming tariffs and underwhelming guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 47.53, -3.08, -6.1%).To be fair, China followed up and said it hopes the U.S. can meet halfway in trade talks. USTR Lighthizer, however, reportedly told China that it "wouldn't be possible" to meet "halfway," according to CNBC.U.S. Treasuries have come down from prior highs, bringing yields near their unchanged marks.

Futures were pulled lower after China threatened to retaliate against the upcoming 10% tariff rate on Chinese imports, but solid results and guidance from Walmart (WMT 112.71, +6.51, +6.1%) has lifted futures back into positive territory.The market is presumably trying to find its footing after a sharp 3% sell-off yesterday that was attributed to recessionary fears. China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

China added to those worries this morning, but it didn't provide any specific details related to countermeasures. Instead, Walmart has given the market some reassurance that consumer spending remains resilient, which has outweighed the disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.38, -4.23, -8.4%).A wide range of economic data will be released today, which will feature Retail Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.The weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 1.1), the Philadelphia Fed Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 10.0), and the preliminary Q2 readings for Productivity (Briefing.com consensus 1.3%) and Unit Labor Costs (Briefing.com consensus 1.6%) will also be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.In addition, Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 77.8%) for July will be released at 9:15 a.m. ET, followed by Business Inventories for June (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) at 10:00 a.m. ET and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June at 4:00 p.m. ET.The U.S. Treasury market continues to see increased demand, driving yields even lower across the curve.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 15, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 futures trade 26 points, or 0.9%, above fair value after trading as low as 1.3% below fair value last evening.Futures opened lower in response to President Trump announcing after Friday's close that he will raise the tariff rates on goods imported from China.

Attention quickly shifted to trade, however, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion of goods imported from the U.S on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, which are the same dates the U.S. has planned for its tariffs on China. The tariff rate will range from 5-10%, including a separate 5-25% on autos and auto parts starting Dec. 15.Modest selling ensued, but stocks quickly recouped losses after Mr. Powell reiterated comments that upheld the market's view for further economic stimulus. The day had barely begun, though, and President Trump took to Twitter to lash out against both the Fed Chair and China. Stocks fell noticeably on the president's declaration that companies find alternatives to China.A steady broad-based retreat transpired during the day amid worries that escalated trade tensions will exacerbate slowing global growth and, by extension, affect corporate earnings. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in negative territory, which saw the energy (-3.4%) and information technology (-3.3%) sectors losing over 3%. The utilities sector (-1.1%) declined the least.Shares of Apple (AAPL 202.64, -9.82) fell 4.6% and other trade-sensitive areas like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.4%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-3.3%) also posted steep losses. Shares of Foot Locker (FL 34.00, -7.93, -18.9%) plunged nearly 20% after the company missed top and bottom-line estimates.Amid the uncertainty and growth concerns, investors flocked to safe-haven assets like gold ($1537.25/oz, +$28.75, +1.9%), the Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasuries. In addition, expectations for further downside in equities contributed to a 17.8% spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (19.65, +2.97).The 2-yr yield dropped seven basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield dropped eight basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.73. WTI crude fell 2.0%, or $1.12, to $54.16/bbl.President Trump also indicated he would officially respond to Beijing's actions in the afternoon. No response was announced by session's close, which may have contributed to some reservations to step into the action during the day.Friday's economic data was limited to New Home Sales for July:New home sales declined 12.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 (Briefing.com consensus 645,000) from an upwardly revised 728,000 (from 646,000) in June. New home sales were up 4.3% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that there was a big upward revision for June, yet there was no follow-through in July despite low mortgage rates and lower median sales prices. Sales were down big in three of the four regions and the total number of new homes sold was still below the originally reported 646,000 increase for June.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +16.8% YTDS&P 500 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +9.9% YTDRussell 2000 +8.2% YTDBriefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

The market fell early to 2810.25. Then buyers stepped in following reports that China called to restart trade talks. Apparently, that phone call was already scheduled. Later, President Trump was asked if he could reach a deal with China and tariffs could be delayed and he said "anything is possible." The market is just off session highs of 2888.50. In Asia, the markets took a dive following the trade headlines that swooped the market on Friday. The Nikkei was hit by over 2% after the yen took flight on Friday. leaving export stocks reeling. The Shanghai was also knocked down with the currency hitting an 11-year low against the dollar. In Europe, the major bourses are caught in the wake of the waves created by the trade turmoil. The volatility has led to the region seeing a mixed session with the FTSE down 0.5%, while the CAC leads with a gain of 0.5% thus far.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +25.010 yr Note: 1.45%USD/JPY: 105.95 +0.60EUR/USD: 1.1113 -0.0024Europe: FTSE -0.5% DAX +0.3% CAC +0.5%Asia: Hang Seng -1.9% Shanghai -1.5% Nikkei -2.2%Gold (1538.70 +1.10) Silver (17.58 +0.16) Crude (54.51 +0.34)17:20WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ENDP (2.9 +28.32%), PBYI (10.99 +17.16%), CHRS (22.01 +16.58%), PGNX (4.29 +15.95%)Materials: HMY (3.58 +20.54%), HL (1.67 +15.17%)Industrials: DRYS (5.17 +34.99%), FLY (20 +17.79%)Consumer Discretionary: TGT (103.49 +22.9%), CATO (15.99 +20.77%), PDD (29.49 +17.91%), HOME (6.06 +17.67%)Information Technology: CMCM (3.9 +21.5%), QIWI (22.96 +20.27%), PSTG (15.63 +17.08%)Energy: TELL (7.5 +18.11%)Consumer Staples: DF (1.1 +34.31%), BJ (25.03 +15.45%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: RTRX (13.07 -26.57%), SRPT (93.61 -25.08%), NVAX (6.24 -20.47%), ANAB (40.31 -18.07%), QTNT (9.25 -16.14%)Consumer Discretionary: FLWS (15.29 -16.86%)Information Technology: CREE (47.1 -19.9%)Financials: LTS (1.93 -23.41%), BMA (30.91 -19.25%), GGAL (14.69 -17.19%)Energy: FTSI (2.6 -18.75%), NINE (6.41 -17.29%), ALTM (2.3 -16.36%), EQT (10.35 -16.26%)Utilities: JE (1.15 -32.75%), PCG (11.04 -22.69%)17:20UHAL AMERCO announces special cash dividend of $0.50/share (340.35 -2.80)16:31QCOM Qualcomm announces retirement of interim CFO Dave Wise, effective today (73.52 -3.63)Mr. Wise retires after a 23-year tenure at the company.

Dexcom earlier had defeated one patent in a proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.16:23WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe stock market sold off on Friday after President Trump ordered companies to find an alternative to China in response to Beijing announcing retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. The S&P 500 (-2.6%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.4%) lost around 2.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (-3.0%) and Russell 2000 (-3.1%) lost at least 3.0%.The day started with investors looking forward to Fed Chair Powell's speech from Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Attention quickly shifted to trade, however, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion of goods imported from the U.S on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, which are the same dates the U.S. has planned for its tariffs on China. The tariff rate will range from 5-10%, including a separate 5-25% on autos and auto parts starting Dec. 15.Modest selling ensued, but stocks quickly recouped losses after Mr. Powell reiterated comments that upheld the market's view for further economic stimulus. The day had barely begun, though, and President Trump took to Twitter to lash out against both the Fed Chair and China. Stocks fell noticeably on the president's declaration that companies find alternatives to China.A steady broad-based retreat transpired during the day amid worries that escalated trade tensions will exacerbate slowing global growth and, by extension, affect corporate earnings. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in negative territory, which saw the energy (-3.4%) and information technology (-3.3%) sectors losing over 3%. The utilities sector (-1.1%) declined the least.Shares of Apple (AAPL 202.64, -9.82) fell 4.6% and other trade-sensitive areas like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.4%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-3.3%) also posted steep losses. Shares of Foot Locker (FL 34.00, -7.93, -18.9%) plunged nearly 20% after the company missed top and bottom-line estimates.Amid the uncertainty and growth concerns, investors flocked to safe-haven assets like gold ($1537.25/oz, +$28.75, +1.9%), the Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasuries. In addition, expectations for further downside in equities contributed to a 17.8% spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (19.65, +2.97).The 2-yr yield dropped seven basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield dropped eight basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.73. WTI crude fell 2.0%, or $1.12, to $54.16/bbl.President Trump also indicated he would officially respond to Beijing's actions in the afternoon. No response was announced by session's close, which may have contributed to some reservations to step into the action during the day.Friday's economic data was limited to New Home Sales for July:New home sales declined 12.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 (Briefing.com consensus 645,000) from an upwardly revised 728,000 (from 646,000) in June. New home sales were up 4.3% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that there was a big upward revision for June, yet there was no follow-through in July despite low mortgage rates and lower median sales prices. Sales were down big in three of the four regions and the total number of new homes sold was still below the originally reported 646,000 increase for June.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +16.8% YTDS&P 500 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +9.9% YTDRussell 2000 +8.2% YTDBriefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 lagged behind, though, and still trades at about 0.18% lower. The catalyst appears two fold: comments from President Donald Trump spoke to reporters in front of the White House stating he, "spoke recently with Chinese President Xi," in addition to the recent spike in crude oil futures.The worst-performing names in the S&P 500 today include Gartner (IT 138.97, -31.76, -18.60%), Under Armour (UAA 23.97, -3.47, -12.65%), and HCA (HCA). Theses three all reported earnings in the last 24 hours, all three made multi week lows, and all three were at multi month highs heading into their respective results.Conversely, Natl Oilwell Varco (NOV 23.01, +2.33, +11.27%) sits atop the index, helped in part by today's rise in crude oil futures.14:00 ETDow -46.71 at 27174.64, Nasdaq -16.15 at 8277.18, S&P -8.46 at 3012.51[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite made a session high in the last 30 minutes, now just 0.19% lower vs 0.79% at today's lows.Gold futures moved higher on Tuesday, settling higher by 0.7% to $1,430.20/oz; the yellow metal posted modest gains juxtaposed against the start of the two day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.The U.S. Dollar Index sits less than 0.1% higher to 98.09.13:35 ETDow -58.28 at 27163.07, Nasdaq -26.26 at 8267.07, S&P -10.73 at 3010.24[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are little changed in the last 30 minutes; the Dow Jones Industrial Average still holds the softest declines on Tuesday, down about 0.21%.Today's losses in Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent Pfizer (PFE 38.85, -2.60, -6.27%) have been widely covered; behind PFE shares of Caterpillar (CAT 132.64, -1.82, -1.35%), Walt Disney (DIS 144.71, -1.68, -1.15%), and Intel (INTC 51.98, -0.53, -1.01%) cling to decent losses. DIS gives back a portion of yesterday's all-time highs which were tied to a strong weekend from the company's The Lion King remake, while INTC falls following a cautious sell side mention.Conversely, Boeing (BA 343.38, +3.17, +0.93%) sits near the top of the index, recovering slightly from recent losses, as it appears no bad news is essentially good news for the embattled aerospace and defense company.The DJIA gives back a portion of the recovery from the last two days, now down some 0.68% over the last calendar week.12:55 ETDow -56.49 at 27164.86, Nasdaq -30.01 at 8263.32, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory today with the S&P 500 currently down 0.3%. There hasn't been much buying conviction in the broader market, although the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.5%) has seen some positive action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.Several factors that have contributed to the negative disposition include President Trump saying there are no signs of China buying U.S. agricultural products, some cautious trading ahead of Apple's (AAPL 208.08, -1.59, -0.8%) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrow, and the disappointing price action in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 205.01, -17.12, -7.7%) following its report.Beyond Meat is perhaps more a reflection of how far many stocks, and the stock market to a certain extent, have come in a short period of time. It isn't too surprising to see some broader consolidation -- or to see shares of Beyond Meat attempting a recovery after being down as much as 17% today.The stock market, too, has come off its lows. At this juncture, the utilities (-0.7%), information technology (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.6%) sectors are underperforming, while the materials (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.4%) sectors are outperforming.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 121.29, +5.29, +4.6%) and Merck (MRK 83.42, +0.94, +1.1%) both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Shares are up nicely on the results, while shares of fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.02, -2.44) are down 5.9% after being downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 89.99, -6.93, -7.2%), meanwhile, is feeling the fallout from a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.Separately, an expectation that interest rates will remain low has prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its S&P 500 2019 year-end target to 3100 and set a 2020 year-end price target of 3400. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up one basis point to 2.07%.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1495/1388. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1702/1263.12:25 ETDow -48.62 at 27172.73, Nasdaq -27.14 at 8266.19, S&P -9.68 at 3011.29[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory without much conviction, much like yesterday's session. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 197.14, +1.20, +0.6%) as the lone stock trading higher, while Netflix (NFLX 324.65, -8.05, -2.4%) underperforms. Apple (AAPL 2018.19, -1.50, -0.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1897.51, -14.84, -0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1229.59, -9.82, -0.8%) trade with losses just below 1%.In earnings news, shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 109.46, +0.75, +0.7%) are up after the company beat profit estimates and raised its FY19 EPS outlook.11:55 ETDow -55.98 at 27165.37, Nasdaq -29.89 at 8263.44, S&P -10.57 at 3010.4[BRIEFING.COM] The rebound attempt has lost some steam, as the S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%. It was still a encouraging to see the benchmark index holding above the 3000 level at its lowest point today.Apple (AAPL 208.21, -1.47, -0.7%) will take the spotlight after today's closing bell when it releases its earnings report. Analyst expectations are low, but interest is high for one of the market's most widely-owned stocks that has already surged nearly 32% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on lower note. Germany's DAX lost 2.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.5%, and France's CAC lost 1.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.5%.11:25 ETDow -24.31 at 27197.04, Nasdaq -24.51 at 8268.82, S&P -8.12 at 3012.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have pared early losses and now trade near session highs. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.3%.The Dow has received some support from shares of Procter & Gamble (PG 121.00, +5.00, +4.3%) and Merck (MRK 83.15, +0.65, +0.8%) following their earnings reports. The blue-chip average, however, is being pressured by losses in most components, including Pfizer (PFE 39.32, -2.12, -5.1%), which was downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Separately, shares of Capital One (COF 90.05, -6.87, -7.1%) are getting hit after the company announced a data breach that affected around 100 million customers in the United States and six million in Canada. The suspected hacker has been arrested.10:55 ETDow -46.35 at 27175, Nasdaq -27.63 at 8265.7, S&P -9.07 at 3011.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, recouping some of its opening losses. Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow.Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock. In addition, its poor showing today has caused some investors to reconsider stocks that have also caught fire this year.10:30 ETDow -70.77 at 27150.58, Nasdaq -37.70 at 8255.63, S&P -11.72 at 3009.25[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.2% at 78.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.11)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now +$0.28 (+0.5%) at $57.16/barrel Aug natural gas is +$0.01 (-0.8%) at $2.13/MMBtuMoving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$6.20 at $1426.70/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.06 (+0.4%) at $16.51/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.2%) at $2.68/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1084/1697. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1070/1739.10:05 ETDow -70.83 at 27150.52, Nasdaq -41.09 at 8252.24, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.5%.Just in, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from a revised 124.3 in June (from 121.5).Separately, Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May.09:45 ETDow -113.35 at 27108, Nasdaq -44.21 at 8249.12, S&P -14.31 at 3006.66[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day lower, partly due to some caution ahead of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow and negative trade rhetoric from President Trump. The S&P 500 is down 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows consumer discretionary (-0.7%), health care (-0.7%), and industrials (-0.7%) leading the market lower. Conversely, the utilities (+0.1%), consumer staples (+0.2%) and real estate (+0.6%) sectors are the lone sectors trading higher.U.S. Treasuries are trading near their unchanged marks.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -59.60.The stock market is on pace to pull back further from all-time highs at the open. Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.De-risking efforts appear to be contributing to the negative disposition, partly due to negative trade rhetoric from President Trump stirring trade concerns. Specifically, the president tweeted that there are "no signs" that China has begun to buy U.S. agricultural products. The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai.In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook.Dow components Procter & Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Fellow Dow member Pfizer (PFE 40.40, -1.05, -2.5%) is down after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a Neutral rating.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index.

The overall proportion of patients with AEs leading to study discontinuation were 1.6% for diroximel fumarate and 6.0% for dimethyl fumarate. Of those, the proportion of patients who discontinued due to GI adverse events during the five-week treatment period were 0.8% for diroximel fumarate and 4.8% for dimethyl fumarate. The EVOLVE-MS-2 study is part of the EVOLVE-MS diroximel fumarate clinical development program, which is being conducted as part of a worldwide development and commercialization agreement between Alkermes and Biogen.

Highlights include:Success in the Red Dot exploration program provides an opportunity to extend Marigold mine life. Exploration drilling in 2018 and geotechnical drilling and engineering completed in 2019 support the conversion of Red Dot Mineral Resources. The company expects Red Dot to extend the current Marigold life of mine plan into the early 2030's without the need for expansion capital. The company expects to report conversion of Red Dot Phases 2 and 3 Mineral Resources at year-end 2019, complementing the reported 350,000 ounces of gold Mineral Reserves at Red Dot, referred to as Phase 1, in its year-end 2018 Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources estimate. Exploration and permitting activities are underway at North and South Red Dot, Valmy, East Basalt, and Trenton Canyon areas, aimed at extending known mineralization and discovery during 2019 and beyond. Also, at Marigold, infill drill results for the Mackay pit and the North and South Red Dot areas are expected to add to existing Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources at year-end 2019. At the Seabee Gold Operation, brownfield drill results for the Santoy Gap Hanging Wall are expected to increase Mineral Resources at year-end. Greenfields exploration at the Seabee Gold Operation and Fisher property intersected new mineralized zones at the Batman Lake and Mac targets, respectively, where the company is targeting new gold discoveries. At the Pitarrilla project, the company is reviewing drill programs and engineering studies to identify additional zones and continuity of high grade Mineral Resources with the potential to improve project economics based on current metal prices. It is evaluating contractors to extend the existing underground access and drill these areas. If approved, drilling is anticipated to commence in the second half of 2020.07:24GLW Corning reports EPS in-line, revs inline (34.10 )Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.45 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.45; revenues rose 7.0% year/year to $2.94 bln vs the $2.97 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.In Display Technologies, net sales were $848 mln, up 9% yr/yr, and net income increased by 11% yr/yr.

Garrett is also targeting Adjusted Levered Free Cash Flow conversion in 2019 between 50% and 55%. The reduction in guidance is driven by lower light vehicle production, a slower ramp up of light vehicle gasoline launches in China and a decrease in the euro dollar exchange rate.07:03CMD Cantel Medical to acquire privately-held Hu-Friedy Mfg.

"While weaker overall market demand negatively impacted our sales volume during the first half of 2019, we are confident we have not lost share in our core wood connector business. For the remainder of the year, we are cautiously optimistic housing starts will pick up and enable healthier demand levels."Based on current business trends and conditions, outlook for fiscal year 2019 is expected to be as follows: 2019 full-year gross margin is estimated to be in the range of ~43.5% to 44.0%, lower than previous estimate of 44.5% to 45.5%. 2019 full-year operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, is estimated to be between ~27.5% and 28.5%. 2020 Plan update: Expects its consolidated operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 17% by fiscal 2020 from 16.4% in 2016. This is a downward revision from its prior 2020 target for consolidated operating margin of approximately 21% to 22%. Importantly, Simpson's success in rationalizing its cost structure has helped mitigate further downward pressure on this target. Due to a combination of rising raw material costs and then soon-to-be tariffed finished goods from China, the Company pro-actively built up its anchor inventory, bought an additional allotment of steel (in late 2018) in order to mitigate the potential impact of product availability and built-up inventory to ensure customer needs are met during the SAP roll-out.

The Company continues to focus on reducing its total SKU count and continues to implement Lean principles in all factories to improve working capital management.16:33NPO Enpro Industries beats by $0.34, reports revs in-line; guides FY19 EPS above consensus (64.57 -2.63)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $1.32 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.34 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.98; revenues fell 1.7% year/year to $387.0 mln vs the $389.8 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The overall proportion of patients with AEs leading to study discontinuation were 1.6% for diroximel fumarate and 6.0% for dimethyl fumarate. Of those, the proportion of patients who discontinued due to GI adverse events during the five-week treatment period were 0.8% for diroximel fumarate and 4.8% for dimethyl fumarate. The EVOLVE-MS-2 study is part of the EVOLVE-MS diroximel fumarate clinical development program, which is being conducted as part of a worldwide development and commercialization agreement between Alkermes and Biogen.

Highlights include:Success in the Red Dot exploration program provides an opportunity to extend Marigold mine life. Exploration drilling in 2018 and geotechnical drilling and engineering completed in 2019 support the conversion of Red Dot Mineral Resources. The company expects Red Dot to extend the current Marigold life of mine plan into the early 2030's without the need for expansion capital. The company expects to report conversion of Red Dot Phases 2 and 3 Mineral Resources at year-end 2019, complementing the reported 350,000 ounces of gold Mineral Reserves at Red Dot, referred to as Phase 1, in its year-end 2018 Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources estimate. Exploration and permitting activities are underway at North and South Red Dot, Valmy, East Basalt, and Trenton Canyon areas, aimed at extending known mineralization and discovery during 2019 and beyond. Also, at Marigold, infill drill results for the Mackay pit and the North and South Red Dot areas are expected to add to existing Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources at year-end 2019. At the Seabee Gold Operation, brownfield drill results for the Santoy Gap Hanging Wall are expected to increase Mineral Resources at year-end. Greenfields exploration at the Seabee Gold Operation and Fisher property intersected new mineralized zones at the Batman Lake and Mac targets, respectively, where the company is targeting new gold discoveries. At the Pitarrilla project, the company is reviewing drill programs and engineering studies to identify additional zones and continuity of high grade Mineral Resources with the potential to improve project economics based on current metal prices. It is evaluating contractors to extend the existing underground access and drill these areas. If approved, drilling is anticipated to commence in the second half of 2020.07:24GLW Corning reports EPS in-line, revs inline (34.10 )Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.45 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.45; revenues rose 7.0% year/year to $2.94 bln vs the $2.97 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.In Display Technologies, net sales were $848 mln, up 9% yr/yr, and net income increased by 11% yr/yr.

"While weaker overall market demand negatively impacted our sales volume during the first half of 2019, we are confident we have not lost share in our core wood connector business. For the remainder of the year, we are cautiously optimistic housing starts will pick up and enable healthier demand levels."Based on current business trends and conditions, outlook for fiscal year 2019 is expected to be as follows: 2019 full-year gross margin is estimated to be in the range of ~43.5% to 44.0%, lower than previous estimate of 44.5% to 45.5%. 2019 full-year operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, is estimated to be between ~27.5% and 28.5%. 2020 Plan update: Expects its consolidated operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 17% by fiscal 2020 from 16.4% in 2016. This is a downward revision from its prior 2020 target for consolidated operating margin of approximately 21% to 22%. Importantly, Simpson's success in rationalizing its cost structure has helped mitigate further downward pressure on this target. Due to a combination of rising raw material costs and then soon-to-be tariffed finished goods from China, the Company pro-actively built up its anchor inventory, bought an additional allotment of steel (in late 2018) in order to mitigate the potential impact of product availability and built-up inventory to ensure customer needs are met during the SAP roll-out.

The Company continues to focus on reducing its total SKU count and continues to implement Lean principles in all factories to improve working capital management.16:33NPO Enpro Industries beats by $0.34, reports revs in-line; guides FY19 EPS above consensus (64.57 -2.63)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $1.32 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.34 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.98; revenues fell 1.7% year/year to $387.0 mln vs the $389.8 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The S&P 500 is lower by 0.3% while the Dow (-0.2%) sits a bit closer to its flat line.Equity indices have spent the first half of the session in negative territory after the Employment Situation report for June easily exceeded estimates. The report pointed to the addition of 224,000 nonfarm payrolls (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), which reduced expectations for a sharp rate cut.Granted, the market still expects that 25-basis point rate cut will take place at the July FOMC meeting, but the implied probability of a 50-basis point cut fell to near zero (5.9%) from 29.2% on Wednesday.The reduction in rate cut hopes pressured stocks from freshly-set record highs, but the past two hours have seen a steady rebound off session lows.Nine out of eleven sectors remain in negative territory with consumer staples (-0.8%) and industrials (-0.8%) at the bottom of the leaderboard. Transport stocks contributed to early weakness in the industrials sector, but the high-beta group has taken part in the market's recent rebound, trimming its loss to 0.6%. This leaves the Dow Jones Transportation Average unchanged for the week.Another high-beta group-PHLX Semiconductor Index-has struggled to keep pace with the rebound in the broader market.

Why? Because the June employment report was too strong and cut into the stock market's aggressive rate-cut hopes.Specifically, the 224,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and 3.1% yr/yr increase in average hourly earnings wiped away the possibility of a 50 basis points cut at the July 30-31 FOMC meeting.According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there was a 25.6% probability of a 50 basis points cut before the jobs report was released. Now, there is zero probability; in fact, the CME FedWatch Tool is showing a 4.4% probability of the Fed leaving the target range for the fed funds rate unchanged at the July meeting.The shift in rate-cut expectations has been pronounced as well in the Treasury market, which is weak across the board, in the U.S. Dollar Index, which is up 0.6% to 97.35, and in gold futures, which are down 2.0% to $1392.30/troy oz.The 2-yr note yield, which is highly sensitive to changes in the fed funds rate, is up 13 basis points to 1.88%. The 10-yr note yield is up 11 basis points to 2.06%.Not surprisingly, the equity sectors regarded as bond proxies for their high yields -- real estate, (-1.5%), utilities (-1.2%), and consumer staples (-1.2%) -- are leading today's losses.Every sector, however, is trading lower as the spike in market rates, and the dashing of aggressive rate-cut hopes that had helped drive the indices to record levels, have served as profit-taking catalysts along with a separate Bloomberg report that China is saying it won't do a trade deal unless the U.S. removes all tariffs on Chinese goods.The Russell 2000 is down 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.6%; the S&P 500 is down 0.7%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.8%.10:00DB Deutsche Bank President Garth Ritchie to leave by mutual agreement (8.24 +0.43)Garth Ritchie, President of Deutsche Bank and Head of the Corporate & Investment Bank, is leaving the bank by mutual agreement.

To ensure a smooth transition of time critical UK regulatory matters including Brexit-related issues he will continue to advise the bank until end of November 2019.09:45XLF Financial Select Sector SPDR (28.16 +0.08)The financial sector (+0.2%) has opened today in a position of relative strength; in fact, it is the only sector showing any strength at the moment.Financials have been pressured by falling rates and concerns about fading net interest margins, but with the spike in market rates today following the stronger-than-expected June jobs report, they are getting some relief.The 2-yr note yield is up 11 basis points to 1.86% while the 10-yr note has jumped nine basis points to 2.04%.Online brokers Charles Schwab (SCHW 41.26, +0.81, +2.0%), E*Trade (ETFC 46.50, +0.97, +2.2%), and TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.28, +1.01, +2.0%) are among the early standouts along with the likes of Bank of America (BAC 29.35, +0.30, +1.0%), Goldman Sachs (GS 208.00, +1.96, +1.0%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 113.50, +0.68, +0.6%).09:44WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Rate-Sensitive Sectors Pace Opening DeclineThe stock market has started the day in negative territory amid losses in most sectors.

Real estate (-1.6%), utilities (-1.3%), and consumer staples (-1.0%) sit at the bottom of the leaderboard.

The plants include the casthouses at both facilities and the paste plant at La Corua, which are currently in operation, and the two curtailed smelters. Alcoa has reached an agreement with the workers' representatives relating to a transaction between the company and PARTER Capital Group AG. However, a final acquisition is subject to a buyer-provided credit facility to support future operations. If the acquisition cannot be completed by July 31 (extended from the original June 30 deadline), the collective dismissal and social plan are expected to go into effect on August 1, 2019. Alcoa reached an agreement in January 2019 with the workers' representatives at the two aluminum plants as part of the collective dismissal process announced in October 2018. As part of that agreement, the smelters, with combined operating capacity of 124,000 metric tons per year, were curtailed in February and maintained in restart condition.Alcoa expects to record restructuring-related charges in the third quarter of 2019, rather than in the second quarter of 2019, estimated to range from $100-140 mln, or $0.54 to $0.75 per share, depending on whether an acquisition or collective dismissal occurs. Related cash outlays are expected to be approximately $100-130 mln, with approximately half to be paid in 2019.09:13WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -14.40.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) while average hourly earnings grew 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The stock market is finding the strong headline beat disappointing because it has led to a reduction in expectations for an aggressive rate cut at the July FOMC Meeting. The fed funds futures market now sees just an 8.0% implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut in July, down from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point rate cut will take place on July 31.Treasuries retreated in response to today's data, sliding toward this week's lows.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60.The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance.

The stock market, in fact, has spent the better part of the past three hours reclaiming what it lost in the early going.The rebound effort is understandable. After all, the initial burst of selling was predicated on the disappointment that the jobs report effectively negated the likelihood of a 50-basis points cut at the July 30-31 FOMC meeting. That thinking was evident in the fed funds futures market, which has seen a 25.6% probability of such a move reduced to a current 5.9% (it went to 0% earlier in the day).The residual, however, isn't all that bad -- not at least in terms of how the stock market views things. The residual is a 100% probability of a 25-basis point cut at the July meeting.So, the pairing of strong hiring activity in June with the strongest probability of a 25-basis point rate cut offered a stopgap of sorts for the gap-down beginning.This is how the market sees things. The Fed might have a different say on things come July 30-31, but if one needs a rationale for the turnaround effort, it would be the idea that the stock market still thinks it is going to get its cake (albeit without the icing) and be able to eat it, too.Most sectors are still lower for the day, but all are well off their lows; meanwhile, three sectors -- financials (+0.3%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and communication services (+0.1%) -- have pushed into positive territory, offering an influential measure of support.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the S&P 500 is down 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.13:28EWZ iShares Brazil ETF: Brazil stocks boosted by pension reform progress and strong airline dataBrazilian stocks are notable winners today, mostly on positive reaction to a key congressional committee in Brazil approving a reform platform to tackle Brazil's bloated pension problem. The hope is full passage will come later this year. Investors are seeing this a a positive sign.Another tailwind has been strong June traffic data from two major airlines (AZUL and GOL), which we take as a sign that Brazilian consumers are becoming more confident in their economic outlook and booking more flights.Winners: GOL +20.5%, AZUL +12.4%, SBS +5%, GGB +4%, BBD +4%, ITUB +4%, EWZ +3%.12:56WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Market Under Modest Pressure at MiddayThe major averages hold modest losses at midday. The S&P 500 is lower by 0.3% while the Dow (-0.2%) sits a bit closer to its flat line.Equity indices have spent the first half of the session in negative territory after the Employment Situation report for June easily exceeded estimates. The report pointed to the addition of 224,000 nonfarm payrolls (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), which reduced expectations for a sharp rate cut.Granted, the market still expects that 25-basis point rate cut will take place at the July FOMC meeting, but the implied probability of a 50-basis point cut fell to near zero (5.9%) from 29.2% on Wednesday.The reduction in rate cut hopes pressured stocks from freshly-set record highs, but the past two hours have seen a steady rebound off session lows.Nine out of eleven sectors remain in negative territory with consumer staples (-0.8%) and industrials (-0.8%) at the bottom of the leaderboard. Transport stocks contributed to early weakness in the industrials sector, but the high-beta group has taken part in the market's recent rebound, trimming its loss to 0.6%. This leaves the Dow Jones Transportation Average unchanged for the week.Another high-beta group-PHLX Semiconductor Index-has struggled to keep pace with the rebound in the broader market. The Index is down 0.9% today and it is now down 0.1% for the week after being up 5.0% on Monday morning. The broader technology sector (-0.5%), meanwhile, trades a bit behind the broader market.Biotech names are under pressure after President Trump said that his administration is preparing a "favored-nations clause" that would reduce the prices that Medicare pays for drugs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 109.41, -1.52, -1.4%) is down 1.4%.On the upside, financials (+0.4%) have shown relative strength thanks to an uptick in Treasury yields.

Why? Because the June employment report was too strong and cut into the stock market's aggressive rate-cut hopes.Specifically, the 224,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and 3.1% yr/yr increase in average hourly earnings wiped away the possibility of a 50 basis points cut at the July 30-31 FOMC meeting.According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there was a 25.6% probability of a 50 basis points cut before the jobs report was released. Now, there is zero probability; in fact, the CME FedWatch Tool is showing a 4.4% probability of the Fed leaving the target range for the fed funds rate unchanged at the July meeting.The shift in rate-cut expectations has been pronounced as well in the Treasury market, which is weak across the board, in the U.S. Dollar Index, which is up 0.6% to 97.35, and in gold futures, which are down 2.0% to $1392.30/troy oz.The 2-yr note yield, which is highly sensitive to changes in the fed funds rate, is up 13 basis points to 1.88%. The 10-yr note yield is up 11 basis points to 2.06%.Not surprisingly, the equity sectors regarded as bond proxies for their high yields -- real estate, (-1.5%), utilities (-1.2%), and consumer staples (-1.2%) -- are leading today's losses.Every sector, however, is trading lower as the spike in market rates, and the dashing of aggressive rate-cut hopes that had helped drive the indices to record levels, have served as profit-taking catalysts along with a separate Bloomberg report that China is saying it won't do a trade deal unless the U.S. removes all tariffs on Chinese goods.The Russell 2000 is down 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.6%; the S&P 500 is down 0.7%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.8%.10:00DB Deutsche Bank President Garth Ritchie to leave by mutual agreement (8.24 +0.43)Garth Ritchie, President of Deutsche Bank and Head of the Corporate & Investment Bank, is leaving the bank by mutual agreement. Ritchie will be stepping down as Head of CIB and as a member of the Management Board on July 31. To ensure a smooth transition of time critical UK regulatory matters including Brexit-related issues he will continue to advise the bank until end of November 2019.09:45XLF Financial Select Sector SPDR (28.16 +0.08)The financial sector (+0.2%) has opened today in a position of relative strength; in fact, it is the only sector showing any strength at the moment.Financials have been pressured by falling rates and concerns about fading net interest margins, but with the spike in market rates today following the stronger-than-expected June jobs report, they are getting some relief.The 2-yr note yield is up 11 basis points to 1.86% while the 10-yr note has jumped nine basis points to 2.04%.Online brokers Charles Schwab (SCHW 41.26, +0.81, +2.0%), E*Trade (ETFC 46.50, +0.97, +2.2%), and TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.28, +1.01, +2.0%) are among the early standouts along with the likes of Bank of America (BAC 29.35, +0.30, +1.0%), Goldman Sachs (GS 208.00, +1.96, +1.0%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 113.50, +0.68, +0.6%).09:44WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Rate-Sensitive Sectors Pace Opening DeclineThe stock market has started the day in negative territory amid losses in most sectors. The S&P 500 trades lower by 0.6% with ten out of eleven sectors in the red.Rate-sensitive groups are among the early laggards. Real estate (-1.6%), utilities (-1.3%), and consumer staples (-1.0%) sit at the bottom of the leaderboard. Conversely, financials (+0.3%) trade in the green as weakness in Treasuries boosts yields.Treasuries sit on their lows with the 10-yr yield up nine basis points at 2.04%.09:32WP Worldpay/Fidelity Nat'l Info (FIS) secure European Commission approval for pending merger; deal has now received all required regulatory approvals needed for consummation (126.97 -1.07)Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining customary contractual conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including receipt of the requisite shareholder approvals at each of FIS' and Worldpay's special meetings to be held on July 24, 2019, the parties expect to consummate the Merger on or about July 31, 2019.09:22AA Alcoa announces updates on Avils and La Corua aluminum plants in Spain and expected restructuring charges (22.70 )Alcoa has signed a conditional share purchase agreement with private equity investment firm PARTER Capital Group AG to acquire the Alcoa Avils and La Corua aluminum plants in Spain. The plants include the casthouses at both facilities and the paste plant at La Corua, which are currently in operation, and the two curtailed smelters. Alcoa has reached an agreement with the workers' representatives relating to a transaction between the company and PARTER Capital Group AG. However, a final acquisition is subject to a buyer-provided credit facility to support future operations. If the acquisition cannot be completed by July 31 (extended from the original June 30 deadline), the collective dismissal and social plan are expected to go into effect on August 1, 2019. Alcoa reached an agreement in January 2019 with the workers' representatives at the two aluminum plants as part of the collective dismissal process announced in October 2018. As part of that agreement, the smelters, with combined operating capacity of 124,000 metric tons per year, were curtailed in February and maintained in restart condition.Alcoa expects to record restructuring-related charges in the third quarter of 2019, rather than in the second quarter of 2019, estimated to range from $100-140 mln, or $0.54 to $0.75 per share, depending on whether an acquisition or collective dismissal occurs. Related cash outlays are expected to be approximately $100-130 mln, with approximately half to be paid in 2019.09:13WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -14.40.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) while average hourly earnings grew 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The stock market is finding the strong headline beat disappointing because it has led to a reduction in expectations for an aggressive rate cut at the July FOMC Meeting. The fed funds futures market now sees just an 8.0% implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut in July, down from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point rate cut will take place on July 31.Treasuries retreated in response to today's data, sliding toward this week's lows.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60.The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance.

Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia'a June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)---FX---USD/JPY: +0.2% to 108.03USD/CNH: +0.1% to 6.8804USD/INR: +0.1% at 68.5307:02WIRES On The WiresLGI Homes, Inc.

Fugitive billionaire Guo Wengui: Communist Party 'destroying itself'UPIAugust 12, 2019 Monday 10:56 AM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 376 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Dec. 31 BodyA fugitive Chinese billionaire who has previously met with U.S. President 's former senior counselor  said internal weakness in the Chinese Communist Party raises concerns about its long-term stability.Guo Wengui, who lives in New York and has pledged to expose political corruption in China, said he has privately met with Chinese Communist Party officials who voice doubts about the future, Taiwan's Liberty Times reported Monday.Guo, who made his fortune in Chinese real estate before fleeing the country, said one "senior member" is skeptical the annual Beidaihe summit will take place next year, citing political upheaval and internal party divisions, according to the report.The meeting at Beidaihe holds symbolic importance for the Communist Party. It involves former and incumbent Chinese officials of the highest rank, and takes place in late July or early August each year. The meeting takes place in a resort area about 170 miles east of Beijing.According to Guo, the Chinese government source said multiple crises are facing the world's second-largest economy, including the protests in Hong Kong, China's economic downturn and fiscal deficit, potential revolt in Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as growing popular opposition toward Internet censorship.Guo did not reveal the identity of his source, who had recently attended this year's Beidaihe meeting. He said his source "made history" at the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party, held in November 2012. The Chinese billionaire added his description should make it easy to identify his source, and said the "important point, where the Chinese Communist Party is destroying itself, has already begun," according to Liberty Times.Guo left China after August 2014, when Chinese authorities began to investigate him for corruption. He has claimed he is the victim of false accusations and government graft.Guo's statements to the Taiwanese press comes at a time when violent footage of the police crackdown against protesters in Hong Kong continues to be uploaded to social media.The BBC's Stephen McDonell tweeted Sunday Hong Kong police mercilessly beat local protesters, and included footage from Hong Kong's Apple Daily, showing the violence taking place at a subway station in the city.Load-Date: August 13, 2019End of Document

Mnuchin Expects Shanghai Meeting To Be Followed By More Rounds Of TalksThe FrontrunnerJuly 25, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 431 wordsBodyReuters (7/24) reports the White House confirmed Wednesday that US and Chinese officials "will meet face-to-face next week for the first time since" President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping "agreed in June to revive talks aimed at ending a yearlong trade war between the world's two largest economies." Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and USTR Lighthizer "will lead a team of American officials in discussions in Shanghai" starting on Tuesday with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. Mnuchin told reporters at the White House yesterday, "There'll be a few more meetings before we get a deal done. I wouldn't expect that we'll resolve all the issues. But the fact that we're back at the table at the direction of the two presidents is important."Asked on CNBC's Squawk Box (7/24, 114K) about the progress of US-China trade negotiations, Mnuchin said, "There's a significance to them of the Shanghai Communique and the symbolism, obviously, of that important agreement. So hopefully I'll take that as good news, that we'll be making progress next week. But I would say there's a lot of issues, so my expectation this will be followed up with a meeting back in [Washington]...and hopefully we'll continue to progress."Mnuchin: Trump Unconcerned By Google's Work For Chinese Government.Asked on CNBC's Squawk Box (7/24, 114K) about Peter Thiel's charge that Alphabet and Google's cooperation with China, alongside its reluctance to work with the Pentagon, verges on "treasonous," Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said he and President Trump have both "look[ed] into that." According to Mnuchin, Google has "assured us that there is very, very limited work. The only work they're doing is some minimal open source work. They continue to do work with us in certain areas of DOD. I think Google is an American company that wants to help out the US." Mnuchin added, "Again, the President and I looked at this, and we're not aware of Google working with the Chinese government in a way that raises concerns."In its report on Mnuchin's remarks, the Wall Street Journal (7/24, Tweh, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) notes that earlier this month, Thiel called for the FBI and CIA to investigate Google for working with China, and Trump tweeted last week that his Administration would study claims by Thiel, who served on his White House transition team.WSJournal A1 Analysis: Europe Caught In Middle Of US-China Trade Tensions.A front-page Wall Street Journal (7/24, A1, Hannon, Kostov, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) analysis says Europe is suffering from the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China.Load-Date: July 25, 2019End of Document

The 2019 China Digital Entertainment Congress (CDEC) kicks off in Shanghai; At the event Perfect World CEO Dr. Robert Hong Xiao speaks about new development of the digital cultural and creative industryPR NewswireAugust 6, 2019 Tuesday 7:21 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 584 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, Aug. 6, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe 2019 China Digital Entertainment Congress (CDEC), with the theme of "Challenges, Opportunities and Dreams", kicked off in Shanghai on August 1.As one of the most professional, authoritative and internationally influential events in the Chinese digital entertainment sector, CDEC has attracted a number of well-known Chinese digital entertainment companies including Tencent, NetEase, Perfect World, Giant Interactive Group and Shengqu Games. It is an occasion for the enterprises to join hands to initiate the transformation of the cultural and creative industry in the new digital era, as well as to provide the world's digital entertainment community with preemptive opportunities brought about by the development of a Chinese digital entertainment ecosystem."The digital cultural and creative industry has excelled in delivering an outstanding experience and more value to users and in connecting with them emotionally. Digital cultural and creative companies can leverage this unique advantage to enable the transformation of the traditional cultural and entertainment sectors and to explore and create new momentum together with traditional players," said Perfect World CEO Dr. Robert Hong Xiao at the conference during his keynote speech."In addition, the implementation of 5G technologies is expected to fundamentally change the e-sports sector, delivering a new exciting gaming experience to users by transforming the previous forms of entertainment on both the production and consumption sides. 5G technologies are on track to boost the development of e-sports while bringing new approaches to traditional sports."The digital cultural and creative industry, one of the most dynamic within China's national economy, has not only transformed the way cultural content is produced, communicated and consumed, but has also empowered and rejuvenated the traditional side of the sector.Taking e-sports, an emerging sector within the industry, as an example, the sector, by collaborating with counterparts in the larger entertainment content sector, has generated a number of new forms of entertainment, including e-sports variety shows, live events, movies and music, delivering an unprecedented variety of new experiences to consumers. By empowering other traditional cultural and entertainment sectors, e-sports is also likely to create new business models, including e-sports-themed tourism, finance, e-commerce and training.E-sports has gradually become a platform for mass entrepreneurship and innovation while providing new opportunities to the governments of many Chinese cities. The future of the larger industry, including e-sports, is promising due to its unique features and advantages. It has become the common mission of all industry players to explore how to unlock the industry's potential value via innovation.As a high-end authoritative conference that is held concurrently with China Digital Entertainment Expo and Conference (ChinaJoy), CDEC has been held for 16 consecutive years since its launch in 2003. CDEC has been and continues to be highly valued by government officials, with many attending in person. CDEC is also a not-to-missed event for many executives from internationally renowned digital entertainment companies who make sure to be present every year. View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-2019-china-digital-entertainment-congress-cdec-kicks-off-in-shanghai-300897090.htmlSOURCE Perfect World Co., Ltd.CONTACT: Ximeng Chen, +86-10-5780-6664, chenximeng@pwrd.comLoad-Date: August 7, 2019End of Document

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index. Investors will also receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, Pending Home Sales for June, and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May.Nasdaq Composite +25.0% YTDS&P 500 +20.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.7% YTDRussell 2000 +16.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1472/1420. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1183/1867.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 30, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 197.14, +1.20, +0.6%) as the lone stock trading higher, while Netflix (NFLX 324.65, -8.05, -2.4%) underperforms. Apple (AAPL 2018.19, -1.50, -0.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1897.51, -14.84, -0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1229.59, -9.82, -0.8%) trade with losses just below 1%.In earnings news, shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 109.46, +0.75, +0.7%) are up after the company beat profit estimates and raised its FY19 EPS outlook.11:55 ETDow -55.98 at 27165.37, Nasdaq -29.89 at 8263.44, S&P -10.57 at 3010.4[BRIEFING.COM] The rebound attempt has lost some steam, as the S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%. It was still a encouraging to see the benchmark index holding above the 3000 level at its lowest point today.Apple (AAPL 208.21, -1.47, -0.7%) will take the spotlight after today's closing bell when it releases its earnings report. Analyst expectations are low, but interest is high for one of the market's most widely-owned stocks that has already surged nearly 32% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on lower note. Germany's DAX lost 2.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.5%, and France's CAC lost 1.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.5%.11:25 ETDow -24.31 at 27197.04, Nasdaq -24.51 at 8268.82, S&P -8.12 at 3012.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have pared early losses and now trade near session highs. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.3%.The Dow has received some support from shares of Procter & Gamble (PG 121.00, +5.00, +4.3%) and Merck (MRK 83.15, +0.65, +0.8%) following their earnings reports. The blue-chip average, however, is being pressured by losses in most components, including Pfizer (PFE 39.32, -2.12, -5.1%), which was downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Separately, shares of Capital One (COF 90.05, -6.87, -7.1%) are getting hit after the company announced a data breach that affected around 100 million customers in the United States and six million in Canada. The suspected hacker has been arrested.10:55 ETDow -46.35 at 27175, Nasdaq -27.63 at 8265.7, S&P -9.07 at 3011.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, recouping some of its opening losses. Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow.Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock. In addition, its poor showing today has caused some investors to reconsider stocks that have also caught fire this year.10:30 ETDow -70.77 at 27150.58, Nasdaq -37.70 at 8255.63, S&P -11.72 at 3009.25[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.2% at 78.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.11)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now +$0.28 (+0.5%) at $57.16/barrel Aug natural gas is +$0.01 (-0.8%) at $2.13/MMBtuMoving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$6.20 at $1426.70/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.06 (+0.4%) at $16.51/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.2%) at $2.68/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1084/1697. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1070/1739.10:05 ETDow -70.83 at 27150.52, Nasdaq -41.09 at 8252.24, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.5%.Just in, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from a revised 124.3 in June (from 121.5).Separately, Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May.09:45 ETDow -113.35 at 27108, Nasdaq -44.21 at 8249.12, S&P -14.31 at 3006.66[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day lower, partly due to some caution ahead of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow and negative trade rhetoric from President Trump. The S&P 500 is down 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows consumer discretionary (-0.7%), health care (-0.7%), and industrials (-0.7%) leading the market lower. Conversely, the utilities (+0.1%), consumer staples (+0.2%) and real estate (+0.6%) sectors are the lone sectors trading higher.U.S. Treasuries are trading near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.85%, and the 10-yield is down one basis point to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.11. WTI crude is up 0.6% to $57.20/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -59.60.The stock market is on pace to pull back further from all-time highs at the open. Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.De-risking efforts appear to be contributing to the negative disposition, partly due to negative trade rhetoric from President Trump stirring trade concerns. Specifically, the president tweeted that there are "no signs" that China has begun to buy U.S. agricultural products. The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai.In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook.Dow components Procter & Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Fellow Dow member Pfizer (PFE 40.40, -1.05, -2.5%) is down after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a Neutral rating.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 197.14, +1.20, +0.6%) as the lone stock trading higher, while Netflix (NFLX 324.65, -8.05, -2.4%) underperforms. Apple (AAPL 2018.19, -1.50, -0.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1897.51, -14.84, -0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1229.59, -9.82, -0.8%) trade with losses just below 1%.In earnings news, shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 109.46, +0.75, +0.7%) are up after the company beat profit estimates and raised its FY19 EPS outlook.11:55 ETDow -55.98 at 27165.37, Nasdaq -29.89 at 8263.44, S&P -10.57 at 3010.4[BRIEFING.COM] The rebound attempt has lost some steam, as the S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%. It was still a encouraging to see the benchmark index holding above the 3000 level at its lowest point today.Apple (AAPL 208.21, -1.47, -0.7%) will take the spotlight after today's closing bell when it releases its earnings report. Analyst expectations are low, but interest is high for one of the market's most widely-owned stocks that has already surged nearly 32% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on lower note. Germany's DAX lost 2.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.5%, and France's CAC lost 1.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.5%.11:25 ETDow -24.31 at 27197.04, Nasdaq -24.51 at 8268.82, S&P -8.12 at 3012.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have pared early losses and now trade near session highs. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.3%.The Dow has received some support from shares of Procter & Gamble (PG 121.00, +5.00, +4.3%) and Merck (MRK 83.15, +0.65, +0.8%) following their earnings reports. The blue-chip average, however, is being pressured by losses in most components, including Pfizer (PFE 39.32, -2.12, -5.1%), which was downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Separately, shares of Capital One (COF 90.05, -6.87, -7.1%) are getting hit after the company announced a data breach that affected around 100 million customers in the United States and six million in Canada. The suspected hacker has been arrested.10:55 ETDow -46.35 at 27175, Nasdaq -27.63 at 8265.7, S&P -9.07 at 3011.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, recouping some of its opening losses. Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow.Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock. In addition, its poor showing today has caused some investors to reconsider stocks that have also caught fire this year.10:30 ETDow -70.77 at 27150.58, Nasdaq -37.70 at 8255.63, S&P -11.72 at 3009.25[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.2% at 78.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.11)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now +$0.28 (+0.5%) at $57.16/barrel Aug natural gas is +$0.01 (-0.8%) at $2.13/MMBtuMoving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$6.20 at $1426.70/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.06 (+0.4%) at $16.51/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.2%) at $2.68/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1084/1697. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1070/1739.10:05 ETDow -70.83 at 27150.52, Nasdaq -41.09 at 8252.24, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.5%.Just in, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from a revised 124.3 in June (from 121.5).Separately, Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May.09:45 ETDow -113.35 at 27108, Nasdaq -44.21 at 8249.12, S&P -14.31 at 3006.66[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day lower, partly due to some caution ahead of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow and negative trade rhetoric from President Trump. The S&P 500 is down 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows consumer discretionary (-0.7%), health care (-0.7%), and industrials (-0.7%) leading the market lower. Conversely, the utilities (+0.1%), consumer staples (+0.2%) and real estate (+0.6%) sectors are the lone sectors trading higher.U.S. Treasuries are trading near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.85%, and the 10-yield is down one basis point to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.11. WTI crude is up 0.6% to $57.20/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -59.60.The stock market is on pace to pull back further from all-time highs at the open. Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.De-risking efforts appear to be contributing to the negative disposition, partly due to negative trade rhetoric from President Trump stirring trade concerns. Specifically, the president tweeted that there are "no signs" that China has begun to buy U.S. agricultural products. The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai.In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook.Dow components Procter & Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Fellow Dow member Pfizer (PFE 40.40, -1.05, -2.5%) is down after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a Neutral rating.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -62.60.The S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mostly higher note. Nikkei reported that more than two thirds of manufacturers in Japan have seen lower quarterly profits in Q2, representing the largest share since the financial crisis. Japan's Cabinet office lowered expectations for growth in fiscal 2019/2020 to 1.3% from 0.9%. The Bank of Japan made no changes to its policy stance, reiterating its readiness to step up easing efforts. The Chinese government reiterated its support Hong Kong's Chief Executive Officer Carrie Lam amid continuing protests.In economic data: Japan's June Industrial Production -3.6% m/m (expected -2.0%; last 2.0%) and June Unemployment Rate 2.3% (expected 2.4%; last 2.4%) South Korea's August Manufacturing BSI Index 74 (last 76) Australia's June Building Approvals -1.2% m/m (expected 0.2%; last 0.3%) and Private House Approvals +0.4% (last -0.3%) New Zealand's June Building Consents -3.9% m/m (last 13.5%)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.4% Hong Kong's Hang Seng: +0.1% China's Shanghai Composite: +0.4% India's Sensex: -0.8% South Korea's Kospi: +0.5% Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.2%Major European indices trade in negative territory with bank stocks among the laggards.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -55.60.The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points, or 0.5%, below fair value and have recently slipped to session lows after President Trump tweeted that China has yet to begin buying U.S. agricultural products.Prior to the president's tweet, there was already a negative tilt in the futures trade as a lack of buying interest seemed to be carrying over from yesterday's session. In the meantime, U.S.-China trade talks are ongoing in China where negotiations can turn to address President Trump's concerns.Separately, the Federal Open Market Committee will kick off its two-day policy meeting today. The Bank of Japan for its part made no changes to its policy stance and reiterated its readiness to step up easing efforts.Before its rate decision tomorrow, the Fed will have a look at its preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) -- in the June report for Personal Income (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) and Spending (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.Investors will also receive the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) at 9:00 a.m. ET, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) and Pending Home Sales for June (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%).

Dec: 1263Moving the MarketSector WatchSome consolidation from record highs in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrowPresident Trump calls out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products; trade talks are ongoing in Shanghai Relative strength in the S&P 500 real estate and consumer staples sectorsStrongest consumer confidence reading since Nov. 2018Strong: Real Estate, Consumer Staples, Utilities, MaterialsWeak: Health Care, Consumer Discretionary, Financials12:55 ETDow -56.49 at 27164.86, Nasdaq -30.01 at 8263.32, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory today with the S&P 500 currently down 0.3%. There hasn't been much buying conviction in the broader market, although the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.5%) has seen some positive action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.Several factors that have contributed to the negative disposition include President Trump saying there are no signs of China buying U.S. agricultural products, some cautious trading ahead of Apple's (AAPL 208.08, -1.59, -0.8%) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrow, and the disappointing price action in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 205.01, -17.12, -7.7%) following its report.Beyond Meat is perhaps more a reflection of how far many stocks, and the stock market to a certain extent, have come in a short period of time. It isn't too surprising to see some broader consolidation -- or to see shares of Beyond Meat attempting a recovery after being down as much as 17% today.The stock market, too, has come off its lows. At this juncture, the utilities (-0.7%), information technology (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.6%) sectors are underperforming, while the materials (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.4%) sectors are outperforming.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 121.29, +5.29, +4.6%) and Merck (MRK 83.42, +0.94, +1.1%) both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Shares are up nicely on the results, while shares of fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.02, -2.44) are down 5.9% after being downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 89.99, -6.93, -7.2%), meanwhile, is feeling the fallout from a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.Separately, an expectation that interest rates will remain low has prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its S&P 500 2019 year-end target to 3100 and set a 2020 year-end price target of 3400. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 2.07%.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1495/1388. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1702/1263.12:25 ETDow -48.62 at 27172.73, Nasdaq -27.14 at 8266.19, S&P -9.68 at 3011.29[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory without much conviction, much like yesterday's session. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 197.14, +1.20, +0.6%) as the lone stock trading higher, while Netflix (NFLX 324.65, -8.05, -2.4%) underperforms. Apple (AAPL 2018.19, -1.50, -0.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1897.51, -14.84, -0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1229.59, -9.82, -0.8%) trade with losses just below 1%.In earnings news, shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 109.46, +0.75, +0.7%) are up after the company beat profit estimates and raised its FY19 EPS outlook.11:55 ETDow -55.98 at 27165.37, Nasdaq -29.89 at 8263.44, S&P -10.57 at 3010.4[BRIEFING.COM] The rebound attempt has lost some steam, as the S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%. It was still a encouraging to see the benchmark index holding above the 3000 level at its lowest point today.Apple (AAPL 208.21, -1.47, -0.7%) will take the spotlight after today's closing bell when it releases its earnings report. Analyst expectations are low, but interest is high for one of the market's most widely-owned stocks that has already surged nearly 32% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on lower note. Germany's DAX lost 2.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.5%, and France's CAC lost 1.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.5%.11:25 ETDow -24.31 at 27197.04, Nasdaq -24.51 at 8268.82, S&P -8.12 at 3012.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have pared early losses and now trade near session highs. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.3%.The Dow has received some support from shares of Procter & Gamble (PG 121.00, +5.00, +4.3%) and Merck (MRK 83.15, +0.65, +0.8%) following their earnings reports. The blue-chip average, however, is being pressured by losses in most components, including Pfizer (PFE 39.32, -2.12, -5.1%), which was downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Separately, shares of Capital One (COF 90.05, -6.87, -7.1%) are getting hit after the company announced a data breach that affected around 100 million customers in the United States and six million in Canada. The suspected hacker has been arrested.10:55 ETDow -46.35 at 27175, Nasdaq -27.63 at 8265.7, S&P -9.07 at 3011.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, recouping some of its opening losses. Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow.Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock. In addition, its poor showing today has caused some investors to reconsider stocks that have also caught fire this year.10:30 ETDow -70.77 at 27150.58, Nasdaq -37.70 at 8255.63, S&P -11.72 at 3009.25[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.2% at 78.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.11)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now +$0.28 (+0.5%) at $57.16/barrel Aug natural gas is +$0.01 (-0.8%) at $2.13/MMBtuMoving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$6.20 at $1426.70/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.06 (+0.4%) at $16.51/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.2%) at $2.68/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1084/1697. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1070/1739.10:05 ETDow -70.83 at 27150.52, Nasdaq -41.09 at 8252.24, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.5%.Just in, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from a revised 124.3 in June (from 121.5).Separately, Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May.09:45 ETDow -113.35 at 27108, Nasdaq -44.21 at 8249.12, S&P -14.31 at 3006.66[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day lower, partly due to some caution ahead of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow and negative trade rhetoric from President Trump. The S&P 500 is down 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows consumer discretionary (-0.7%), health care (-0.7%), and industrials (-0.7%) leading the market lower. Conversely, the utilities (+0.1%), consumer staples (+0.2%) and real estate (+0.6%) sectors are the lone sectors trading higher.U.S. Treasuries are trading near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.85%, and the 10-yield is down one basis point to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.11. WTI crude is up 0.6% to $57.20/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -59.60.The stock market is on pace to pull back further from all-time highs at the open. Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.De-risking efforts appear to be contributing to the negative disposition, partly due to negative trade rhetoric from President Trump stirring trade concerns. Specifically, the president tweeted that there are "no signs" that China has begun to buy U.S. agricultural products. The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai.In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook.Dow components Procter & Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Fellow Dow member Pfizer (PFE 40.40, -1.05, -2.5%) is down after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a Neutral rating.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40.

In the meantime, U.S.-China trade talks are ongoing in China where negotiations can turn to address President Trump's concerns.Separately, the Federal Open Market Committee will kick off its two-day policy meeting today. The Bank of Japan for its part made no changes to its policy stance and reiterated its readiness to step up easing efforts.Before its rate decision tomorrow, the Fed will have a look at its preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) -- in the June report for Personal Income (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) and Spending (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.Investors will also receive the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) at 9:00 a.m. ET, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) and Pending Home Sales for June (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index.

There hasn't been much buying conviction in the broader market, although the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.5%) has seen some positive action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.Several factors that have contributed to the negative disposition include President Trump saying there are no signs of China buying U.S. agricultural products, some cautious trading ahead of Apple's (AAPL 208.08, -1.59, -0.8%) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrow, and the disappointing price action in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 205.01, -17.12, -7.7%) following its report.Beyond Meat is perhaps more a reflection of how far many stocks, and the stock market to a certain extent, have come in a short period of time. It isn't too surprising to see some broader consolidation -- or to see shares of Beyond Meat attempting a recovery after being down as much as 17% today.The stock market, too, has come off its lows. At this juncture, the utilities (-0.7%), information technology (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.6%) sectors are underperforming, while the materials (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.4%) sectors are outperforming.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 121.29, +5.29, +4.6%) and Merck (MRK 83.42, +0.94, +1.1%) both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Shares are up nicely on the results, while shares of fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.02, -2.44) are down 5.9% after being downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 89.99, -6.93, -7.2%), meanwhile, is feeling the fallout from a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.Separately, an expectation that interest rates will remain low has prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its S&P 500 2019 year-end target to 3100 and set a 2020 year-end price target of 3400. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up one basis point to 2.07%.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1495/1388. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1702/1263.12:25 ETDow -48.62 at 27172.73, Nasdaq -27.14 at 8266.19, S&P -9.68 at 3011.29[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory without much conviction, much like yesterday's session. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 197.14, +1.20, +0.6%) as the lone stock trading higher, while Netflix (NFLX 324.65, -8.05, -2.4%) underperforms. Apple (AAPL 2018.19, -1.50, -0.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1897.51, -14.84, -0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1229.59, -9.82, -0.8%) trade with losses just below 1%.In earnings news, shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 109.46, +0.75, +0.7%) are up after the company beat profit estimates and raised its FY19 EPS outlook.11:55 ETDow -55.98 at 27165.37, Nasdaq -29.89 at 8263.44, S&P -10.57 at 3010.4[BRIEFING.COM] The rebound attempt has lost some steam, as the S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%. It was still a encouraging to see the benchmark index holding above the 3000 level at its lowest point today.Apple (AAPL 208.21, -1.47, -0.7%) will take the spotlight after today's closing bell when it releases its earnings report. Analyst expectations are low, but interest is high for one of the market's most widely-owned stocks that has already surged nearly 32% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on lower note. Germany's DAX lost 2.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.5%, and France's CAC lost 1.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.5%.11:25 ETDow -24.31 at 27197.04, Nasdaq -24.51 at 8268.82, S&P -8.12 at 3012.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have pared early losses and now trade near session highs. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.3%.The Dow has received some support from shares of Procter & Gamble (PG 121.00, +5.00, +4.3%) and Merck (MRK 83.15, +0.65, +0.8%) following their earnings reports. The blue-chip average, however, is being pressured by losses in most components, including Pfizer (PFE 39.32, -2.12, -5.1%), which was downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Separately, shares of Capital One (COF 90.05, -6.87, -7.1%) are getting hit after the company announced a data breach that affected around 100 million customers in the United States and six million in Canada. The suspected hacker has been arrested.10:55 ETDow -46.35 at 27175, Nasdaq -27.63 at 8265.7, S&P -9.07 at 3011.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, recouping some of its opening losses. Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow.Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock. In addition, its poor showing today has caused some investors to reconsider stocks that have also caught fire this year.10:30 ETDow -70.77 at 27150.58, Nasdaq -37.70 at 8255.63, S&P -11.72 at 3009.25[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.2% at 78.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.11)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now +$0.28 (+0.5%) at $57.16/barrel Aug natural gas is +$0.01 (-0.8%) at $2.13/MMBtuMoving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$6.20 at $1426.70/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.06 (+0.4%) at $16.51/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.2%) at $2.68/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1084/1697. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1070/1739.10:05 ETDow -70.83 at 27150.52, Nasdaq -41.09 at 8252.24, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.5%.Just in, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from a revised 124.3 in June (from 121.5).Separately, Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%).

The S&P 500 is down 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows consumer discretionary (-0.7%), health care (-0.7%), and industrials (-0.7%) leading the market lower.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -59.60.The stock market is on pace to pull back further from all-time highs at the open. Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.De-risking efforts appear to be contributing to the negative disposition, partly due to negative trade rhetoric from President Trump stirring trade concerns. Specifically, the president tweeted that there are "no signs" that China has begun to buy U.S. agricultural products. The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai.In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook.Dow components Procter & Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index.

DIS gives back a portion of yesterday's all-time highs which were tied to a strong weekend from the company's The Lion King remake, while INTC falls following a cautious sell side mention.Conversely, Boeing (BA 343.38, +3.17, +0.93%) sits near the top of the index, recovering slightly from recent losses, as it appears no bad news is essentially good news for the embattled aerospace and defense company.The DJIA gives back a portion of the recovery from the last two days, now down some 0.68% over the last calendar week.12:55 ETDow -56.49 at 27164.86, Nasdaq -30.01 at 8263.32, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory today with the S&P 500 currently down 0.3%. There hasn't been much buying conviction in the broader market, although the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.5%) has seen some positive action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.Several factors that have contributed to the negative disposition include President Trump saying there are no signs of China buying U.S. agricultural products, some cautious trading ahead of Apple's (AAPL 208.08, -1.59, -0.8%) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrow, and the disappointing price action in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 205.01, -17.12, -7.7%) following its report.Beyond Meat is perhaps more a reflection of how far many stocks, and the stock market to a certain extent, have come in a short period of time. It isn't too surprising to see some broader consolidation -- or to see shares of Beyond Meat attempting a recovery after being down as much as 17% today.The stock market, too, has come off its lows. At this juncture, the utilities (-0.7%), information technology (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.6%) sectors are underperforming, while the materials (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.4%) sectors are outperforming.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 121.29, +5.29, +4.6%) and Merck (MRK 83.42, +0.94, +1.1%) both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Shares are up nicely on the results, while shares of fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.02, -2.44) are down 5.9% after being downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 89.99, -6.93, -7.2%), meanwhile, is feeling the fallout from a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.Separately, an expectation that interest rates will remain low has prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its S&P 500 2019 year-end target to 3100 and set a 2020 year-end price target of 3400. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up one basis point to 2.07%.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%).

Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow.Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock.

The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai.In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook.Dow components Procter & Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%).

Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V.

On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index.

Trump administration reportedly delays deciding whether to let US companies resume selling to HuaweiBusiness Insider USAugust 9, 2019 Friday 05:40 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 651 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Rosie Perper)Highlight: The reported move follows China's decision to halt imports of US agricultural goods along with threats to slap additional tariffs on them.BodyREUTERS/Jorge Silva/File photo• US officials are delaying a decision on whether to grant licenses to US companies wishing to resume sales to Huawei, sources familiar with the situation told Bloomberg on Thursday. • The US Department of Commerce added Huawei to a trade blacklist in May, which prevents the company from buying parts and components from US companies without government approval. • Last month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced an easing of restrictions and said he would issue licenses to companies to let them sell once more, subject to national security considerations.• But Bloomberg said this system could be knocked off-track in response to China's escalating the trade war again this week by halting US agricultural imports.• Visit Business Insider's home page for more stories.The White House is delaying a decision on whether to let US companies start selling once more to blacklisted Chinese tech giant Huawei, sources familiar with the situation told Bloomberg on Thursday. Companies were due to be issued licenses to recommence trade with Huawei despite it being placed on a trade blacklist by the Trump administration.But, despite promises of a "timely" delivery, companies are still waiting for approval.The delay in issuing licenses comes as the US continues to shift its policy regarding Huawei, which has found itself in the center of trade war negotiations between China and the US.The Trump administration previously said Huawei technology could pose a national security risk, citing a risk that it could be used as a backdoor for Chinese government espionage.The US Department of Commerce added Huawei to a trade blacklist in May. This prevents the company from buying important parts and components from US companies without government approval.Last month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced an easing of restrictions against Huawei after a meeting between President Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at a G20 summit.Ross said he would issue licenses to companies so long as continued trade with Huawei doesn't present a national security threat.Read more: Trump meets with top US tech leaders to discuss sales to Huawei as he moves to soften restrictions against the Chinese tech giantSeveral firms, including major chipmaker Intel, have already applied for licenses, which Trump said would be processed in a "timely" manner. Ross            recently said that he expected to deliver a verdict on around 50 applications soon."We are interested in getting them all together to see them as a unified bloc," he said last month. According to Bloomberg, the delay was a response to China's announcement this week that it will halt imports of US agricultural goods. The embargo came alongside threats of additional tariffs on US agricultural produce.China's announcement was part of a series of tit-for-tat moves made as trade talks between the world's largest economies begin to stumble. Last week, Trump said the US would expand tariffs to virtually all imports from China starting on September 1. Trump previously said China was "letting us down" by refusing to buy US agricultural goods and that it hadn't kept promises it made during trade talks. "China is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great Farmers that they said they would," Trump wrote on Twitter last month. "Hopefully they will start soon!"NOW WATCH: 5 things wrong with Apple's lightning cableSee Also:• Tech's 5 FAANG stocks just saw $150 billion of their market value vaporized, and Apple is reeling the hardest• Chinese state media says Huawei is testing a smartphone with its homegrown HongMeng operating system to rival Google's Android OS• Peter Thiel just cranked up his attack on Google's 'naive' relationship with China in a blistering New York Times op-edSEE ALSO: Intel says it's been selling tech to Huawei as the US eases up on the Chinese companyLoad-Date: August 9, 2019End of Document

There weren't too many positive catalysts for the broader market, but the small-cap Russell 2000 did advance 1.1% to finish near session highs.The S&P 500's worst levels of the day came shortly after the open, as investors appeared uninterested to participate in the action in front of Apple's (AAPL 208.78, -0.90, -0.4%) earnings report after the close and the FOMC's rate decision tomorrow. President Trump alleging that China has yet to buy U.S. agricultural products added to the negative tone.Still, aside from some profit taking in hot-flying stocks like Beyond Meat (BYND 194.76, -27.37, -12.3%) and Under Armour (UAA 24.08, -3.36, -12.2%) following their earnings reports, there was no serious interest to withdraw from the broader market. At its low, the S&P 500 was down 0.7% and hanging just above the 3000 level, where it would firmly stay above the rest of the day.The final standings reflected a mixed session with five S&P 500 sectors finishing higher and six sectors finishing lower. The utilities (-0.8%), information technology (-0.7%), and consumer discretionary (-0.7%) sectors underperformed, while the energy (+1.1%), real estate (+0.9%), and materials (+0.6%) sectors finished on top.Energy stocks gained traction as oil prices ($58.05, +1.18, +2.1%) made a big move in the afternoon on no confirmed news catalyst. The noticeable gain today could have been derived from speculation that the Fed's expected rate cut tomorrow could increase demand for oil.In other corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 120.41, +4.41, +3.8%) and Merck (MRK 83.27, +0.78, +1.0%) pleased investors with their earnings results. Pfizer (PFE 38.79, -2.66) fell 6.4% after the stock was downgraded at both Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 91.21, -5.71) fell 5.9% after disclosing a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.U.S. Treasuries finished slightly lower in another muted session. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point each to 1.85% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished unchanged at 98.05.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May.Looking ahead, investors will receive the FOMC rate decision, the ADP Employment Change report for July, the Chicago PMI for July, the Employment Cost Index for the second quarter, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +24.7% YTDS&P 500 +20.2% YTDRussell 2000 +17.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD16:15EPD Enterprise Products announces long-term agreements with Chevron (CVX) subsidiary Chevron U.S.A.

Revenue upside came from successful promotions in the US and Canada, strength in family plans, and promotions with Google and Hulu. Marketing partnerships are helping to drive subscriber growth.

The stock trades at ~3.7x 2019 estimates. Spotify also has a 17% stake in Tencent Music (TME), which is worth almost $5 bln. The valuation discount to other high-quality software subscription businesses reflects the company's poor margin profile given the hefty licensing fees paid to music labels.

For 2019, Gilead's guidance currently calls for net product sales of $21.3-21.8 bln. This guidance reflects the anticipated entry of generic versions of Letairis and Ranexa in the United States and the full year impact of generic products containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in certain European countries. In Q1, U.S. sales were down 15% sequentially due to the anticipated inventory drawdown associated with their HIV products, reflective of the seasonal inventory pattern from Q4 to Q1. In-line with company expectations, HIV payer mix moved more toward public payers, which also contributed to the sequential decline.In early July, Gilead & Galapagos (GLPG) announced their entry into a 10-year global research and development collaboration through which Galapagos will receive a $3.95 bln upfront payment and $1.1 bln equity investment from Gilead. In turn, Gilead will gain access to a portfolio of compounds, including six molecules currently in clinical trials, more than 20 preclinical programs and a proven drug discovery platform. The agreement also includes a 10-year standstill restricting Gilead's ability to seek to acquire Galapagos or increase its stake in Galapagos beyond 29.9%. In mid-July, the company announced that John McHutchison, AO, MD, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research & Development, had decided to leave the company, effective next month. The company said it would immediately commence a search for his successor. McHutchison joined Gilead in 2010.Following a recent meeting with the FDA, the company said a path forward has been established to submit the NDA for filgotinib as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in 2019. Look for the company to elaborate on this during today's callGilead currently has a market cap of $86 bln and trades at a P/E of 10x & P/S of 3.9x. Earlier this week, RBC upgraded Gilead to "Top Pick" from "Outperform" with a $91 price target, describing the valuation disconnect as too big to ignore.

Broad-based demand for its solutions, and particular strength in mobile computing, drove results, said co. Lifted its FY19 EBITDA margin outlook slightly to approx. 22% due to improved productivity. Authorized the repurchase of up to $1 bln of shares of common stock.CRWD (95.72 +9.73%): Continued volatility. At this juncture, the stock's gains more than fully reclaim yesterday's losses, and the stock has again achieved a new all-time best level.MLM (243.58 +8.75%): Posted Q2 results; co missed on EPS but reported in-line revs (+6.4% yr/yr to $1.28 bln). Aggregates shipments increased +10%, led by double-digit growth in co's Mid-America and Southeast Groups. Raised FY19 revs guidance to $4.535-4.73 bln (prior $4.48-4.68 bln), citing "belief that the current construction cycle will continue for the foreseeable future and expand further this year for each of the Company's three primary construction end-use markets." Co expects attractive underlying market fundamentals to continue to bolster private-sector construction demand in key regions. Touches up to new all-time highs.Large Cap LosersIT (139.3 -18.41%): Reported upside Q2 EPS and in-line revs but lowered its guidance for FY19 adj. EPS (to $3.39-3.64 from $3.82-4.19), adj. EBITDA (to $670-700 mln from $720-765 mln), and revs (to $4.22-4.26 bln from $4.22-4.32 bln). Commenting during its call on the updated lower-end revs guidance, co noted that "about half of the reduction is from nonsubscription products and services"; its lower EBITDA outlook also reflects incremental operating expense of +1-2% vs co's prior outlook. Drops from yesterday's all-time high. SSNC (50 -16.24%): Co reported in-line Q2 results while guiding Q3 and FY19 revs below consensus. During its call, co cited lower trading values across Wall Street, slow M&A, and attrition in DST, among other items, as factors in its guidance. Downgraded to Neutral from Buy at DA Davidson. At six-month lows. UAA (24.18 -11.88%): Reported in-line Q2 revs (+1.4% yr/yr to $1.19 bln) and upside EPS. Gross margin in the quarter expanded by 170 basis points yr/yr to 46.5%, driven by supply chain initiatives, regional mix, and restructuring charges. Wholesale revenue decreased 1% to $707 mln while DTC revs increased +2% to $423 mln. Issued slightly downside FY19 EPS guidance; sees FY revs up approx. +3-4%, reflecting a slight decline in North America and a low to mid-teen percentage rate increase in its international business.15:08BONDX Treasury Market SummaryTreasuries Tick Lower Ahead of Expected Rate CutU.S. Treasuries ended Tuesday on a modestly lower note, erasing a portion of yesterday's gains ahead of tomorrow's release of the July FOMC Statement. Treasuries lurched higher at the start of today's cash session, but that push was short-lived and followed by a slip into negative territory. The early losses were widened after the release of better than expected Consumer Confidence for July (actual 135.7; Briefing.com consensus 125.5) and Pending Home Sales for June (actual 2.8%; Briefing.com consensus 1.0%), but it wasn't long before Treasuries found support and trimmed their losses. Today's fairly quiet session preceded tomorrow's FOMC Statement, which the market expects to herald the start of a new easing cycle. The fed funds futures market is certain that a 25 bps rate cut will take place tomorrow while the implied likelihood of a 50 bps cut sits at 21.9% after climbing above 60.0% two weeks ago. Meanwhile, former New York Fed President William Dudley penned a column for Bloomberg, suggesting that the FOMC could stop after just one rate cut. The U.S. Dollar Index returned to its flat line in the afternoon after marking another fresh high for the month in overnight trade. Yield Check: 2-yr: +1 bp to 1.85% 3-yr: +1 bp to 1.82% 5-yr: +1 bp to 1.84% 10-yr: +1 bp to 2.06% 30-yr: UNCH at 2.59%News: The 12th round of trade talks between officials from China and the United States began in Shanghai today, but President Trump accused Chinese negotiators of not sticking to their promises. Japan's Cabinet office lowered expectations for growth in fiscal 2019/2020 to 1.3% from 0.9%. The Bank of Japan made no changes to its policy stance, reiterating its readiness to step up easing efforts. China's President, Xi Jinping, said that the CCP will not try to boost the economy through real estate. Japan's June Industrial Production decreased 3.6% m/m (expected -2.0%; last 2.0%) while June Unemployment Rate ticked down to 2.3% from 2.4% (expected 2.4%). South Korea's August Manufacturing BSI Index decreased to 74 from 76. Australia's June Building Approvals decreased 1.2% m/m (expected 0.2%; last 0.3%) while Private House Approvals increased 0.4% (last -0.3%).British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has reportedly refused to meet with EU leaders until they agree to remove the Irish backstop from the Brexit agreement. Eurozone's July Business and Consumer Survey decreased to 102.7 (expected 102.6) from 103.3. Today's Data: Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May. The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000. The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity. The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index increased 2.4% yr/yr in May after a 2.5% increase in April. Pending Home Sales increased 2.8% in June (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) after increasing 1.1% in May.

That spike did not have a confirmed news catalyst, which by default lends itself to plenty of speculation as to why it happened. In the end, it could quite simply just be a short squeeze moment.In any event, the bump in crude oil prices, along with a relatively pleasing earnings report from BP (BP 40.15, +1.06, +2.7%), has underpinned the strength in the energy sector (+1.1%), which is the market's bets-performing area.As a reminder, Exxon (XOM 75.45, +0.11, +0.2%) and Chevron (CVX 124.58, +0.35, +0.3%) are slated to report their quarterly results before the open on Friday.The Russell 2000 is up 0.9%; the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average are flat; and the S&P 500 is down 0.2%.14:11SHOP Shopify earnings preview -- Company's track record is impeccable, but stakes are high as stock is priced to perfection (318.36 -1.67)Before the open on August 1, Shopify (SHOP) will issue its Q2 results and will provide guidance for Q3, along with an updated outlook for FY19. The high-flying commerce platform developer has exceeded analysts' top and bottom line expectations in every quarter since its May 2015 IPO.Additionally, while its growth rate has tapered off, SHOP's revenue growth is still remarkably high despite becoming a $1 bln+ company. Over the past four quarters, revenue growth has drifted lower from 60% to 50%.SHOP's exceptional performance relative to expectations, combined with its high double-digit revenue growth has made it a premier growth stock. And, the stock has a valuation to prove it, trading at an exorbitant 17.7x expected FY20 sales.Through its basic offering, users can manage products and inventory, process payments, access data and analytics, and communicate with customers. SHOP has been building onto its core offerings by launching Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital, which provides cash advances and loans to business owners.Furthermore, the company has been focused on growing its premium (and higher priced) Shopify Plus product, which caters more to larger and high-volume customers. Plus offers all the basic capabilities, but it includes add-ons like apps such as Script, Launchpad, and flow. Also, users have access to a dedicated point-of-contact and the company recently launched a multi-currency feature.The rapid growth of Plus and adoption of these new features have been significant growth drivers.What's ExpectedIn its Q1 report, SHOP issued upside guidance for Q2, seeing revenue of $345-$350 mln. The consensus is at the high end of that range at $350.5 mln. Analysts are anticipating SHOP to report EPS of $0.02.Gross merchandise volume (GMV) and monthly recurring revenue (MRR) are two other key metrics to monitor. Last quarter, GMV increased 50% to $11.9 bln following a 54% surge in Q4. MRR increased 36% to $44.2, essentially inline with Q4's growth rate.While profitability hasn't been the main focus of investors during this hyper-growth stage, it has become more of an issue as SHOP's valuation has ballooned. Although the profit margin was very slim, SHOP did report positive Adj. net income of $10.3 mln in Q1, up from $4.2 mln in 1Q18.Guidance: In order to meet analysts' Q3 expectations, SHOP will need to guide for EPS of $0.11 and revenue of $375 mln. In its Q1 report, SHOP issued inline guidance for FY19, projecting revenue of $1.48-$1.50 bln. It also raised its operating income guidance to $20-$30 mln from $10-$20 mln.Quick Take: SHOP's track record of exceeding expectations and its enduring high double digit growth rates are equally impressive. Given the meteoric valuation, the bar is high once again as the stock is priced for perfection. So far, though, SHOP has delivered the exceptional results that investors have come to expect.13:57SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Granite Construction (GVA) sinks following second quarter warning -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersMEDP (79.79 +17.89%): Topped consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+25.8% yr/yr to $214.1 mln) and raised its guidance for FY19 EPS and revs above consensus. Net new business awards increased +16.4% yr/yr. Cancellations returned to an anticipated historical range from elevated levels seen during the past two quarters. At all-time highs.TREX (79.29 +16.57%): Reported upside Q2 revs and in-line EPS; guided Q3 revs above consensus. Co noted that it experienced strong demand across its residential product portfolio and sales channels during the quarter; it also commented that start-up costs related to new Enhance Naturals and Basics decking products have largely been worked through. Co has moved up a planned capacity expansion based on demand trends that signal that the conversion from wood has accelerated a faster pace than expected. Reaches ten-month highs.OMF (41.29 +15.43%): Beat consensus for Q2 EPS. Declared $2.00/share special dividend. Upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Wedbush. At three-year highs.Mid Cap LosersGVA (35.96 -19.15%): Dropped to three-year lows after issuing a Q2 warning; co, following certain events related to four legacy, unconsolidated heavy civil joint venture projects, judges that revs and EPS for the quarter will be well below consensus expectations, as results are now expected to include after-tax charges of between $104-108 mln in connection with increased project completion costs and a recent unfavorable court ruling on a project dispute. Co also announced that it has accelerated its strategic review of the Heavy Civil Operating Group. Downgraded to Neutral from Buy at B. Riley FBR. BERY (46.04 -16.58%): Missed on Q3 EPS and revs (fell 6.5% yr/yr to $1.94 bln). Co's net sales decline included an organic sales decrease of $158 mln, primarily attributed to decreased selling prices of $94 mln due to the pass through of lower resin costs and a 3% base volume decline. Divisions seeing base volume weakness included Engineered Materials and Health, Hygiene, & Specialties. Reaffirmed FY19 free cash flow guidance and guided for FY20 free cash flow of $800 mln and cash from operations of approx. $1.4 bln. Also announced that it has sold its Seal for Life business to Arsenal Capital Partners for approx. $330 mln as part of its ongoing portfolio analysis. Moved to eight-month lows. DORM (72.42 -12.67%): Posted downside results for Q2 EPS and revs. Reported temporary headwinds from higher distribution costs, a product sales mix that pressured margins, and soft end market demand from its Traditional channel. Cut its FY19 EPS guidance, seeing downside results, and narrowed its guided FY19 net sales range. Co's EPS guidance includes anticipated costs of approx. $10.9 mln connected to start up inefficiencies and other costs related to its distribution facility move. Co now targets fully operating out of its new distribution facility as it exits 2019 and expects distribution costs to return to more typical levels as co moves through 2020. Co delayed some distribution location consolidation efforts by approx. six months to minimize customer disruptions. Sees lowest levels since October.13:51BBT BB&T Corp increases quarterly dividend to $0.45/share from $0.405/share (51.14 -0.06)13:25AMD Advanced Micro to report after today's closing bell (33.55 +0.07)AMD (AMD 33.55, +0.07, +0.2%) will report its Q2 results after today's closing bell, followed by management's conference call at 17:30 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the company to report a 42.9% yr/yr decrease in EPS to $0.08 on a 13.3% yr/yr decrease in revenue to $1.52 bln. On April 30, the company guided for Q2 revenue between $1.47 bln and $1.57 bln. Chipmakers stocks have had a mixed first half of 2019, reflecting the uneven recovery taking place within the industry. AMD, however, has been one of the best performers, having climbed more than 80% year-to-date. That rally took place as the company refreshed its product lineup, offering comparable performance to more expensive processors from Intel (INTC 51.99, -0.52, -1.0%) and video cards from NVIDIA (NVDA 174.91, +0.09, +0.1%). Due to this dynamic, it is likely that AMD grew its market share for the seventh quarter in a row in Q2. Shares of AMD hover within a point of last year's high, which was notched in September.AMD trades at 39.3x forward earnings expectations, up from 36.8x going into the Q1 report. This puts the stock at a significant premium to Intel and a more modest, but still considerable, premium to NVIDIA.13:10OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:GCI Aug 10 calls (volume: 6540, open int: 90, implied vol: ~52%, prev day implied vol: 42%). 4500 contracts traded in a single transaction.

There hasn't been much buying conviction in the broader market, although the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.5%) has seen some positive action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.Several factors that have contributed to the negative disposition include President Trump saying there are no signs of China buying U.S. agricultural products, some cautious trading ahead of Apple's (AAPL 208.08, -1.59, -0.8%) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrow, and the disappointing price action in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 205.01, -17.12, -7.7%) following its report.Beyond Meat is perhaps more a reflection of how far many stocks, and the stock market to a certain extent, have come in a short period of time. It isn't too surprising to see some broader consolidation -- or to see shares of Beyond Meat attempting a recovery after being down as much as 17% today.The stock market, too, has come off its lows. At this juncture, the utilities (-0.7%), information technology (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.6%) sectors are underperforming, while the materials (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.4%) sectors are outperforming.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 121.29, +5.29, +4.6%) and Merck (MRK 83.42, +0.94, +1.1%) both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Shares are up nicely on the results, while shares of fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.02, -2.44) are down 5.9% after being downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 89.99, -6.93, -7.2%), meanwhile, is feeling the fallout from a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.Separately, an expectation that interest rates will remain low has prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its S&P 500 2019 year-end target to 3100 and set a 2020 year-end price target of 3400. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up one basis point to 2.07%.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%).

GAAP EPS was ($0.74) vs. the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.66. The second quarter of 2019 net loss was affected by a non-cash change in the value of Ligand's investment in Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) of $12.4 mln.Additionally, as part of its earnings release and conference call, the company provided several updates that appear to be rattling investors:Metavant has been working with FDA to determine a path forward for the glucagon receptor antagonist or GRA program now known as RVT-1502 in diabetes. Ligand believes that continued development of RVT-1502 for diabetes in the U.S. is highly unlikely based on preclinical and clinical trials now required by FDA for any drug in the GRA class intended for long-term use. Metavant may choose to explore certain other indications and/or geographies for RVT-1502 and expects to make a decision later this year.On the call, Ligand provided several updates to its OmniAb platform:Says 35-plus partners are currently running over 170 discovery campaignsHas over $900 mln of total OmniAb potential milestones under contractSays OmniAb business is performing better than expected...trends are generally "very positive", but not all contracts they've signed are still active. Co has seen attrition with some contracts terminated or essentially inactive. Points to M&A activity as number one factor for this...Provides example that deals with Stemcentrx and ARMO, both which were acquired, were not renewed. Additionally, Celgene (CELG) is inactive now, and co expects that due to Bristol-Myers (BMY) acquisition, the deal will not be renewed either... Co moved to remind investors that partner figures are net of attrition. Believes that first Ligand OmniAb antibody could be on the market by the end of 2021 or 2022.As part of today's release, Ligand reaffirmed its 2019 outlook for revenues and Adj-EPS. Separately, as of June 30, Ligand had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.3 bln. On the call, the company said that outside of repurchases, it is continually evaluating other uses of capital such as dividends, convertible bond retirements, and more. Following the report, H.C. Wainwright reflected on the company's results by reiterating its Buy rating and $214 price target.Also on investors minds, Lemelson Capital Management, publicly critical of the company for years, announced that it had increased its short position in Ligand and called on the US Attorney's office for the Southern District of California to investigate the company for alleged criminal violations of federal securities laws amidst what it has called SEC failures. Worth noting that Lemelson has been charged by the SEC in connection with its prior commentary on Ligand, but has denied all charges and says it is actively defending the matter.Ligand shares are down 30% YTD, and now down 66% from their late 2018 highs. Shares are currently at their lowest level since November of 2016.12:34AAPL Apple Third Quarter Earnings Preview (208.06 -1.61)Apple (AAPL) will report third quarter earnings this afternoon at 4:30 PM; the call starts at 5:00 PM. Third quarter S&P Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.10 (-10% yr/yr) on revenue of $53.38 bln (+0.2% yr/yr). The company guided for revenue of $52.5-54.5 bln and gross margin of 37-38% (vs. 38.3% last year). Q3 gross margins ests stand at 38.1%The Street is expecting Q3 iPhone revenue of $26.0 bln (-15% yr/yr) and a services gross margin up slightly from 63.8% last quarter. The company no longer breaks out unit sales for its hardware.The company will guide for Q4 revenues and gross margin. Estimates call for revenue down 3.1% to $60.92 bln with gross margin flat yr/yr at 38.3%.iPhone sales are falling in a saturated smartphone market. Efforts to increase iPhone revenue through higher prices have seemingly exacerbated the elongated iPhone cycle even more. Apple will unveil its newest slate of iPhone in September, but that cycle is expected to remain somewhat muted as consumers hold out for the 5g compatible iPhone in the fall of 2020. However, Apple is rolling out Apple Arcade and Apple TV Plus. In addition, Apple iPads and AirPods sales are still strong.Investors will be watching out for any impact on the supply chain from tariffs, any color on the Qualcomm (QCOM) settlement, and any color on how the purchase of a majority stake in Intel's (INTC) smartphone modem business will impact margins in AAPL's iPhone business. As a side note, President Trump denied a tariff waiver request for Apple's Mac Pro computer. However, this computer costs $6000 minimum and is designed for video editing professionals and thus makes up a very small part of Apple's business.Apple chipmaker Taiwan Semi (TSM) posted a beat on the top and bottom line and guided Q3 revenues above consensus. TSM shares rallied 2% in response.Analyst Notes: Cowen says they expect Apple to report in line results and guide next week with Sep quarter revenues +14% qtr/qtr. iPhone builds are holding up. Purchase of modem assets from Intel (INTC) makes strategic sense & approximately $0.40 impact to FY21 EPS assuming $2 bln in operating expenses. Upcoming TV+ launch could be a second half catalyst for services business. They estimate gross margins to improve 50bps in Sep quarter on better costs, but FX could be headwind.Earnings are expected to grow almost 11% with revenue up 4.3% in fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2019 earnings and revenue are expected to fall 4% and 3%, respectively.AAPL has a $956 billion valuation and trades at 18x FY19 EPS estimates or 16.5x FY20 EPS estimates. The multiple is roughly two turns lower backing out the net cash balance.Based on the weekly AAPL Aug02 $207.50 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~5% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).On a positive report, look for resistance near the $211.50-212.50 area, while support sits near the $200-201Suppliers to keep on note include: SSNLF, LPL (for displays) and LITE, FNSR and IIVI (for FaceID.)

A bloated balance sheet, poor M&A decision making, management miss steps and a slow down in the business led to a steady decline in shares from late 2016 until late 2018. Shares of GE would fall from $31 to $6 over that time frame. The stock has shown signs of finding a bottom though and has actually outpaced the markets in 2019, rallying nearly 40% off the December lows. Analysts suggested that the share price may have rallied too aggressively given the issues that confront the company. Variables ranging from losses at its GE Capital unit, Boeing (BA) slow downs for aviation, weakness in the Power unit and restructuring make it difficult for analysts to model. Further color on these issues will be welcomed by investors. Free Cash Flow (FCF) will be a key metric to follow. GE has forecast FCF at an outflow of (-$2 bln)- ($-1bln) in Q2. Analysts are looking for the company to beat these expectations as the outlook is being viewed as overly cautious. In Q1, GE reported a FCF outflow of (-$884 bln) which was better than feared. GE stated that it expects FCF to return to positive territory in 2020 and to accelerate thereafter in 2021. There are some concerns about restructuring charges that has some analysts questioning this outlook. We would also note that GE has had a run of beat and lowering expectations in this metric which is obviously an odd dynamic.In addition, GE has announced a number of deals in the quarter which has investors excited about the top line growth. This comes at a time were there is growing competition in many of GE's key industries. There are concerns that the orders are coming at reduced pricing which could impact margins. To wit, GE's outlook for margin expansion of flat to up 100 bps is in question. This could also be reflected in the FCF.Below is a recap of key guidance levels to watch, a recap of Q1 results (broken down by segment) and an update on recent divestiture news.GuidanceRevenues- Low Single Digit to Mid Single DigitsFree Cash Flow- (-$2.0)- $0 bln.Margins- Expansion of flat to up 100 bps.EPS- $0.50-0.60 (Adjusted); Restructuring is expected to weigh on GAAP EPS by $0.22-0.25.The 73 MAX groundings are expected to have a $200-300 mln impact on cash flows. GE has said it does not expect a recovery in the power market in the near term. GE has said it does not expect to achieve double digit cash flow margins for at least three years.Q1 RecapGE reported Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.14 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.09. Revenues fell 1.8% year/year to $27.29 bln vs the $27.31 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

GE Capital ended the quarter with $122 billion of assets, including $15 billion of liquidity. Capital earnings improved $350 million from a loss last year, primarily due to lower excess interest costs, tax law changes, higher gains, and lower impairments.DivestituresThe Company announced the sale of BioPharma to Danaher for more than $20 billion in cash proceeds, expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019.Recently closed the merger of GE Transportation with Wabtec, resulting in $2.9 billion of cash proceeds and a 24.9% ownership stake in Wabtec. GE Capital completed $1.1 billion of asset reductions and paid down $2 billion of external debt. GE also recently reached final agreement with the United States Department of Justice to settle the FIRREA investigation of WMC for $1.5 billion, as previously reserved and disclosed.There are rumors that Starwood Capital and Apollo Global Management have offered to purchase the aircraft refinancing unit for $4 bln.CNBC reported that the company is looking to sell its VC portfolio GE Ventures on June 13.On May 30 GE said its jet leasing unit was not for sale.

Fiat Chrysler reported a 2% yr/yr increase in U.S. sales in June after seeing 2% growth in May and a 6% decrease in April. Sales of Ram pickups were strong throughout the quarter while sales of other vehicles were mixed. Sales of the Jeep Wrangler dropped off after a strong finish to 2018. The company reiterated its expectations for EPS of EUR2.70 in FY19 when releasing Q1 results in May. The company began merger discussions with Renault in May, but the plan was scrapped due to interference by the French government. The Wall Street Journal reported in late June that the two companies hope to restart discussions "soon." Fiat Chrysler derives nearly a quarter of its revenue from large European countries like Germany, Italy, France, and Spain. It is no secret that these economies have been weak so far in 2019, so investors will be curious to hear comments about the company's outlook for the region.Shares of Fiat Chrysler trade within a point of their May low, which was reached after the release of Q1 results. The stock trades at 4.4x forward earnings expectations, which represents a discount to Ford (F 9.52, -0.08, -0.8%) and General Motors (GM 40.39, -0.29, -0.7%).11:42SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- McDermott (MDR) drops on downside earnings and guidance -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCNX (7.5 +21.08%): Reported Q2 results; co missed on EPS while reporting upside revs (+50.5% yr/yr to $605.03 mln) -- included in co's 2019 earnings was an unrealized gain on commodity derivative instruments of $211 mln and a loss of $20 mln due to a non-cash charge connected to stock-based compensation expenses. Quarterly sales volumes of 135 Bcfe increased +10% yr/yr. Raised its 2019 production volumes outlook while lowering its consolidated 2019 EBITDAX guidance in connection with a decline in natural gas prices. Sees 2020 production volumes of 570-595 Bcfe, equating to a yr/yr increase of approx. +12% based on the midpoints of guidance.FRAC (5.61 +12.2%): Beat consensus for Q2 revs (fell 26.1% yr/yr to $427.7 mln, exceeding the high end of co's prior guidance). Improvements in efficiencies and a reduction of white space in co's frac calendar contributed to sequential improvement in co's Completion Services revs during the quarter. Co expects revs for its Completions Services business to range between $430-450 mln in Q3; it expects to achieve utilization of approx. 96% of its deployed fleets. Co also notes that it remains on track to complete its merger with C&J during Q4.AMKR (9.13 +11.55%): Topped estimates for Q2 EPS on in-line revs (fell 16.0% yr/yr to $895.31 mln). Co cited "strong factory performance and prudent cost management" for the sequential improvement achieved in its operating income, which increased sequentially to $23 mln from $13 mln. Guided Q3 EPS and revs in-line, anticipating gains in its mobile communications and consumer markets. At three-month highs.Small Cap LosersMDR (6.07 -39.77%): Missed on Q2 EPS and revs (+23.2% yr/yr to $2.14 bln). Backlog as of the end of Q2 for expected 2020 revs was $7.4 bln. Slashed its guidance estimates for FY19, now seeing downside revs of approx. $9.5 bln (prior circa $10.0 bln), adj. EBITDA of approx. $725 mln (prior $1.1 bln), and adj. diluted EPS of approx. $(0.32) (prior $1.65). Co's guidance had as of Q1 been predicated on expectations for stronger operating performance in the second half of 2019 vs the first half. The updated guidance is informed by Q2's soft operating results, the impact on revs and operating expenses from "slippage in certain new awards and customer changes to schedule on several projects," changed assumptions about expected performance from legacy CB&I projects in co's NCSA operating segment, and a shift from Q4 to 2020 in the assumed timing of remaining incentives on the Cameron LNG project. FY guidance assumes sharp improvement in operating income in Q4. Co continues to pursue a sale of the remaining portion of its pipe fabrication business; it also has identified potential buyers for its industrial storage tank business. Co's anticipated aggregate net cash proceeds from the pipe fabrication and storage tank transactions are now expected to be lower than the approx. $1 bln previously estimated. Posts multi-year lows.TBI (19.39 -13.86%): Missed on Q2 revs (fell 4.2% yr/yr to $588.59 mln) while beating consensus on EPS; issued downside guidance for Q3 EPS and revs. Lower volumes within the businesses of its clients contributed to a slower pace of demand in the quarter. At two-year lows.CASA (6.06 -11.27%): Downgraded to Underperform from Mkt Perform at Raymond James. Co's second quarter results will be delivered after the close tomorrow, July 31.11:35SFIX Stitch Fix (-5%) falls to eight-week low after Amazon announces competitive service Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe; it costs $4.99 for one styling per month (26.33 -1.30)Amazon announcementSFIX bounced off its 200-DMA this morning.11:23AKAM Akamai Tech Q2 Earnings Preview (83.68 +0.16)Cloud software company AKAM is scheduled to release second quarter earnings tonight after the bell with a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET (typically the company guides on the call).The current Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for Q2 EPS of $1.00 (vs $0.83 a year ago) on revenue growth of 5.0% to $695.88 million. Q2 guidance calls for EPS of $0.97-1.02 on revs of $688-702 mln.Sees gross margins of approximately 78%.Anticipates Q2 EBITDA margins in the range of 40% to 41%.Expects expense headwinds through remainder of 2019; namely, the company anticipates ~$8 million per quarter of additional operating expense beginning in Q3 as the benefit of its patent royalty payments from Limelight comes to an end and as it takes on higher costs related to its new Cambridge headquarters. Thus, the company expects to see a slight decline in both EBITDA and operating margins in Q3 from Q2 levels with an improvement in Q4.For FY19 AKAM expects EPS of $4.05-4.20 on revs between $2.82-2.86 bln.In anticipation of the Q3 guidance on the call, the Cap IQ Consensus Estimate for Q3 sees EPS of $0.98 on revs of $701.90 mln.Another quiet quarter on the corporate news front leaves AKAM investors waiting on guidance from the call to find out how these past few months have impacted how management sees the remainder of the year. The stocks performance hasn't slowed in recent weeks, up some 3.1% since the close the day after the Q2 print vs the S&P 500's 2.3% move higher over that time.Valuation still seems decent for what you're getting on margins and revenue growth in the Security sector; AKAM trades at just 11.7x forward EBITDA estimates vs peers ServiceNow's (NOW) 47.8x, Autodesk's (ADSK) 36.3x, and VMware's (VMW) 18.6x multiples.11:10TALKX Market Briefing: Down but not too out of sortsThe move out of the gate today was lower as buyers kept to the sidelines, put off by some caustic-sounding trade rhetoric and a sharp drop in shares of momentum stock Beyond Meat (BYND 203.73, -18.40, -8.3%), which acted as an example of why it is prudent to take some money off the table in stocks that have made huge gains in a short period of time.Selling activity, however, has been measured and most sectors have pared their opening losses while others, like real estate (+0.9%) and consumer staples (+0.5%), have preserved most of their gains. One of the best consumer confidence readings since October 2000 helped mitigate some of the early negativity.A big move in Dow component Procter & Gamble (PG 121.13, +5.13, +4.4%), which put up some impressive second quarter results, has offset some big losses in fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.15, -2.30, -5.6%), which is feeling the punch of downgrades at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Overall, there aren't any outsized moves by the sectors today. Instead, the big moves have been reserved for individual stocks like PG and Under Armour (UAA 23.80, -3.64, -13.4%), the latter of which disappointed with its full-year guidance.Market participants are also keeping a close watch on Apple (AAPL 207.86, -1.82, -0.9%), which reports after today's close; and are anxiously awaiting the FOMC decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday.At the same time, they are taking stock of remarks from President Trump who observed before the open that there are no signs that China has begun to purchase U.S. agricultural products and that China "always changes the deal in the end to their benefit."The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.3%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.11:01DHI D.R.

Mnuchin urges US suppliers to seek approval to resume selling to blacklisted Huawei, new report claimsBusiness Insider USJuly 11, 2019 Thursday 03:33 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 595 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Rosie Perper)Highlight: Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit last month and promised to ease certain restrictions off Huawei.Body• Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has encouraged US suppliers to seek governmental approval to resume selling equipment to blacklisted Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. • Tensions between Huawei and the Trump administration heightened in May after the US Department of Commerce added Huawei to a trade blacklist, which prevents the company from buying parts and components from American companies without US government approval. • The ban led to many major US tech companies and suppliers - including Google- to stop providing critical software to the company.• But last month, Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan and agreed to hold off on additional tariffs on Chinese goods and and discussed the clampdown on Huawei.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has encouraged US suppliers to seek approval to resume selling equipment to blacklisted Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The US has raised concerns in recent months that Huawei technology could pose a national security risk and may be used as a backdoor for Chinese government espionage.Tensions between Huawei and the Trump administration heightened in May after the US Department of Commerce added Huawei to a trade blacklist, which prevents the company from buying parts and components from American companies without US government approval. The move could have a dramatic effect on Huawei's operations, as the company relies heavily on US parts.Treasury Department spokeswoman Monica Crowley, however, denied that Mnuchin urged US companies to resume business with Huawei, which would sidestep the national security decision made by the Commerce Department in adding the tech company to its trade blacklist. "Secretary Mnuchin speaks with CEOs in the private sector on a regular basis," Crowley told the Journal. "At no point has the Secretary 'urged' any company to take any action with regard to Huawei."The placement of Huawei on the US trade blacklist has led to many major US tech companies and suppliers -            including Google- to stop providing critical software to the company.The United States' toughened stance on Huawei took place as trade war negotiations between the US and China reached a deadlock in May, with both countries announcing increasing tariffs on a wide array of imports. Last month, Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan and agreed to hold off on additional tariffs on Chinese goods and discussed the clampdown on Huawei."US companies can sell their equipment to Huawei ... there's no great, national emergency problem," Trump told reporters after his meeting. Mnuchin's reported actions follow remarks made by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Tuesday, in which he said the US would issue licenses to US companies looking to sell to Huawei as long as it does not pose a threat to national security, though the Chinese company will remain on the trade blacklist. NOW WATCH: Why Apple's Mac Pro 'trash can' was a colossal failureSee Also:• 6 reasons this is the perfect thank-you email to send after a job interview• Another big tech company is reportedly making a foldable smartphone, suggesting folding screen technology might not be a passing trend• Researchers studied 25,000 leaked Huawei resumes and found troubling links to the government and spiesSEE ALSO: Intel, Qualcomm, and other US tech firms reportedly cut off critical software to Huawei after Trump's blacklistLoad-Date: July 11, 2019End of Document

Here's What Foreign Interference Will Look Like in 2020Atlantic OnlineAugust 9, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2399 wordsByline: Uri FriedmanBodyRussia is "doing it as we sit here."This stray line, buried in seven hours of testimony on Capitol Hill, wasn't just Robert Mueller's way of rebutting the charge that his investigation into the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential election amounted to a two-year, $32 million witch hunt.It was also a blunt message to the lawmakers arrayed before him, the journalists hunting for a bombshell, and the millions of Americans monitoring the proceedings: We're all here fighting the last war, when we really should be bracing ourselves for the coming one.The Russians "expect to do it during the next campaign," the special counsel continued, and "many more countries are developing capability to replicate" Moscow's model.This time, a Donald Trump presidency isn't some pipe dream or fuzzy nightmare, as it was for many foreign governments during the 2016 race. It is instead an all-consuming reality that is disrupting America's alliances, role in the world, and relationships with great powers like China and Russia. The 2020 election will determine whether that reality is an aberration or a new normal.The incentives for other countries to meddle "are so much greater in this election than in the past one, and maybe greater than any election that we've had to this point," Ben Freeman, the director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy, told me. "The opportunities to interfere in the election are just so rampant," he added, reflecting on the dirt-cheap social-media manipulations that Russia made famous a few years ago, and "the barriers to entry for foreign governments have been blown apart."Pointing to the Saudis' stake in seeing Trump, their            lone ally in Washington, reelected, and the Chinese interest in witnessing their            implacable foe on trade defeated, he envisioned a looming "election-interference food fight between foreign countries."So how will the battleground shift from 2016 to 2020? Imagining what it could look like requires widening the definition of what Americans have come to think of as "foreign interference" since Vladimir Putin's intervention in the past presidential race.[           Read: 5 ways to interfere in American elections-without breaking the law]The Hack and Leak: Overcome or Poised for a Comeback?It's unclear whether the Russian government will reprise its most            infamous and innovative act in 2016: the hacking and leaking of emails from the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign. A            less sophisticated operation against Emmanuel Macron's party, of suspected Russian origins but still officially unattributed, occurred during the 2017 French presidential election, fizzling out with nowhere near the impact of the anti-Clinton campaign. The tactic            has also cropped up in feuds between Arab Gulf countries. Yet no such effort succeeded during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections.            Joe Biden and some of the other            Democratic           candidates have pledged to not use fabricated or hacked material during the 2020 race, and Trump has similarly (if less formally)            committed to not exploiting material stolen by a foreign adversary. Department of Homeland Security officials            have met with Trump's presidential-campaign team and those of all his Democratic challengers to ensure they're taking steps such as using secure messaging apps and multifactor authentication for digital services.John Carlin, who until 2016 served as the Justice Department's highest-ranking national-security lawyer, told me that other American adversaries with formidable cybercapabilities, such as North Korea and Iran, could conceivably engage in such behavior. But China, the other big player here, has preferred to engage in traditional espionage, economic espionage, and various            influence operations in the United States. Doing something as "direct" and "high risk" as what Russia did in 2016 would mark "a change in China's approach" and "a significant escalation," Carlin said.Still, Trump has at times almost encouraged foreign actors to repeat the hack-and-leak gambit. He at one point            stated that he would consider accepting a foreign government's offer of damaging information about an opponent. And he has demonstrated that he is easily swayed by calculated data dumps: The British ambassador to the United States was forced to resign this summer over            leaked cables, in which the envoy disparaged the Trump administration, after an unrelenting Twitter outburst from the president.The Dawn of a New Disinformation AgeSocial-media giants such as            Facebook and            Twitter have grown far more sophisticated since 2016 at detecting and disabling coordinated foreign campaigns of misinformation and fake accounts, honing their approach based on challenges confronted not just during the U.S. midterms but in elections everywhere from India to the European Union. (Trump often maintains that tech companies are part of the problem rather than the solution, accusing            Twitter of censoring conservatives and            Google of helping Clinton at his expense in 2016.)These crackdowns, however, have exposed how the actors behind these schemes have multiplied beyond Russia and employed new tactics and tools to exert influence on political processes worldwide. Just last week, for example, Facebook            disrupted one image-burnishing operation coming from Saudi Arabia and another originating in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, both directed at Middle Eastern and African users of Facebook and Instagram.Facebook and Twitter now            regularly           announce purges of coordinated influence operations from countries ranging from Russia to            Iran to            Venezuela. The cybersecurity company FireEye            reported this spring that a social-media campaign possibly "organized in support of Iranian political interests" included Twitter accounts impersonating Republican candidates for the House of Representatives in 2018.In            a study published in July of 53 online foreign-influence efforts in 24 countries from 2013 to 2018, Princeton researchers            found that Russia is by far the most frequent practitioner of such campaigns. (Iran has become a more prominent player since 2016, while China and Saudi Arabia have dabbled in these activities as well.) They discovered that the efforts most often seek to defame specific politicians or persuade voters to adopt a particular political position, rather than aiming to polarize the public by promoting both sides of a divisive issue.One of the researchers, Jacob Shapiro, told me that Russia's continued predominance in these dark arts suggests that other countries still appear to be prevented by international norms from following the Kremlin's lead, even though they're entirely capable of doing so. But he added that the U.S. government hasn't done enough regardless            to deter adversaries from engaging in this behavior. (The Trump administration has imposed sanctions in retaliation for Moscow's political meddling and conducted cyberoperations against Russia, including            just           ahead of the midterm elections, but even Christopher Krebs, the director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,            admitted in June that "we're still trying to figure out what the true pain point is for President Putin and his regime.")"Even if Twitter and Facebook harden themselves significantly, there are tons of other platforms out there where one might promote inauthentic activities to try and shift political attitudes. It's going to be hard to fully police that," Shapiro explained."We have not yet heard the president ... say, 'Any nation which seeks to influence our politics surreptitiously will pay a price. We will aggressively target your institutions that are engaging in it, we will sanction the individuals involved, and it will damage our relationship,'" he said.At the frontier of the concerns about what undeterred American adversaries could experiment with in 2020 are "           deepfakes," sham audio and video made to seem real through artificial-intelligence and machine-learning technologies-a development predicted by the U.S. intelligence community's 2019 "           Worldwide Threat Assessment." The fear has deepened since Facebook            struggled in May to stop the dissemination of a doctored clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appearing to slur her words.Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,            has argued that while the Pelosi footage was a "cheapfake" rather than a "deepfake," it served as a test of whether technology companies, the U.S. government, and the American public are prepared to dispatch with the real deal. The answer, in his view, is no, no, and no.[           Read: The U.S. needs to face up to its long history of election meddling]The Soft Underbelly of America's Election InfrastructureThis is the shoe that didn't drop in 2016. A Senate Intelligence Committee            report released in July found that while there's no evidence that votes were altered or vote tallies manipulated during the past U.S. presidential election, the Russians likely targeted election systems in all 50 U.S. states, including research on "election-related web pages, voter ID information, election system software, and election service companies." In a couple of cases, the Russians succeeded in breaching state election infrastructure. Among the theories aired in the report about Moscow's motivations is that it was cataloging "options or clandestine actions, holding them for use at a later date." (Russia            denies meddling in the election and indeed any involvement in U.S. politics.)"It's a significant finding of both a vulnerability and an intent by the adversary to figure out how to take advantage of that vulnerability," Carlin said. They would most likely use it to suppress votes and "ultimately undermine confidence [not only] in our democracy, but in democratic systems worldwide."He noted that the most consequential way these vulnerabilities could be exploited would be for the Kremlin or another foreign government to change vote counts, an unlikely scenario that nevertheless poses a greater risk in the            few U.S. states that don't have a paper trail for ballots cast. (Carlin            is a lawyer for the plaintiffs in a pro bono lawsuit against one of those states, Georgia, over its electronic voting system.)Foreign actors could also try to make it harder for Americans to exercise the right to vote, perhaps by modifying voter-registration rolls, tampering with government mechanisms for informing voters when and where to vote, indirectly stifling the vote through attacks on systems such as the power grid, or taking a step akin to what the Syrian Electronic Army, a hacking group supportive of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, did in 2013:            breaking into the Associated Press's Twitter feed to falsely report a terrorist attack at the White House, briefly crashing the stock market.Carlin offered the example of hackers broadcasting a message to voters that their polling site is down because of a hurricane, and that they need to head instead to a fake address. "That's so easy to execute, and a bunch of our foreign adversaries have that capability," he said. (Facebook and Twitter are            working on removing content designed to suppress votes, and Twitter's public-policy team            has been meeting with the presidential-campaign teams and the Republican and Democratic National Committees to discuss matters such as account security.)[           Read: The surprising good news about voting security]The Influence Hiding in Plain(ish) SightThe focus on illicit foreign activities for mucking around in American elections, while warranted, has tended to distract from the many            legal and quasi-legal ways foreign governments and nationals exert influence on the U.S. political system. Governments can spread propaganda to American audiences through state-run news organizations such as China's Global Times or Russia's RT. Facebook has instituted            new rules to prevent overseas entities from buying political ads on the site, but there are still loopholes in U.S. campaign-finance law that, for instance, allow them to purchase online ads so long as it's not done in coordination with a campaign and doesn't openly call for the election or defeat of a particular candidate.Foreign leaders can also explicitly or implicitly make their preferences in an election known, or choose to either take an action or refrain from taking an action at pivotal moments during an election cycle. This is what Trump is referring to when he            accuses the Chinese government of slow-walking a trade deal in hopes that he will lose the presidency to what he characterizes as some Democratic pushover in 2020.Perhaps the most common way for other countries to sway American politics and policy is through "dark money," or other direct and indirect funding and influence channels-whether that comes in the form of U.S.-based foreign agents            meeting with campaign officials abroad or American lobbyists            making campaign contributions to American politicians while simultaneously working on behalf of foreign clients. Foreign governments can also financially support think tanks or other nonprofits that have a (technically separate but in practice fluidly operated) political arm that            can engage in activities like buying campaign ads.Foreign governments are inserting themselves into U.S. politics "every single day. It's not just happening on Election Day," Ben Freeman, at the Center for International Policy, said. Given the reputational damage and the retaliation from the U.S. government that election interference could invite, most foreign governments would only resort to placing that "long-shot bet" if and when they feel they can no longer "do the legal influence work here in D.C. and behind the scenes.""A big part of the reason why the Russians had to go to all these illegal measures," he noted, "is because their legal influence operation sucks."Load-Date: August 10, 2019End of Document

In Hong Kong call for boycott of 'Mulan' for supporting crackdown on protestsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 19, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 260 wordsBody(CNN) — Even Mulan is getting into politics.Liu Yifei, the Chinese-born actress who will star in the live action version of Mulan, got into controversy over the protests in Hong Kong on Thursday, August 15, expressing support for the city's police, which anti-government demonstrators accuse of making (r) excessive use of force to stifl discontent."I support the Hong Kong Police. They can attack me now. Shame on Hong Kong," he posted on Weibo, a Chinese social network resembling Twitter.Immediately, people started posting the tag #BoycottMulan on Twitter, a banned social network in China. Hours later, the label was trending in Hong Kong and the United States. Twitter users accused the actress of backing up the excessive use of force by police and drawing attention to the fact that she is a U.S. citizen.Reads: 5 Disney movies break 1,000 mdd barrier in one year"Liu is a naturalized U.S. citizen. It must be nice. In the meantime, it lets go against people who fight for democracy," one person tweeted.On the other hand, it received much praise on Weibo, the dominant platform in China. Almost all comments on its publication echoed support for the Hong Kong police and the Chinese government."They believe in the government, they believe in the central Chinese government, they believe in the country," one user wrote.The protests, which began in June as mostly peaceful demonstrations against an extradition bill that was suspended, have been transformed into something much more grim and violent; protesters frequently clash with the police.       Load-Date: August 20, 2019End of Document

Sohu.com Reports Second Quarter 2019 Unaudited Financial ResultsPR NewswireAugust 5, 2019 Monday 2:21 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5146 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Aug. 5, 2019 BodyPR NewswireSohu.com Limited (NASDAQ: SOHU), China's leading online media, video, search and gaming business group, today reported unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019.Second Quarter HighlightsTotal revenues were US$475 million[1], down 2% year-over-year and up 10% quarter-over-quarter. Brand advertising revenues were US$44 million, down 29% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Search and search related advertising revenues[2] were US$276 million, up 2% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter. Online game revenues were US$102 million, up 8% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. Operating loss for Sohu Video was US$23 million, compared with a loss of US$35 million in the second quarter of 2018. GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited was US$53 million, compared with a net loss of US$48 million in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited was US$50 million. Excluding a charge for impairment of assets recognized by Changyou in the second quarter of 2019 related to the cinema advertising business, Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited was US$38 million, compared with a net loss of US$49 million in the second quarter of 2018. Excluding the profit/loss generated by Sogou and Changyou, the Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited was US$68 million, compared with a net loss of US$80 million in the second quarter of 2018.[1] On a constant currency (non-GAAP) basis, if the exchange rate in the second quarter of 2019 had been the same as it was in the second quarter of 2018, or RMB6.38=US$1.00, US$ total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 would have been US$507 million, or US$32 million more than GAAP total revenues, and up 4% year-over-year.[2] Search and Search related advertising revenues exclude intra-Group transactions.Dr. Charles Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Sohu.com Limited, commented, "Under the current challenging macroeconomic environment, our total revenues stayed largely in-line with our prior guidance. Our bottom line performance, excluding the charge for impairment of assets recognized by Changyou related to its cinema advertising business, met the high-end of our prior guidance. This was mainly driven by the continued cost savings that we were able to achieve at Sohu Video, and the solid performance of our online game business. Sohu Media is making a comeback and living up to its reputation as a top tier media platform. We have been hosting high-quality events, generating and distributing premium content, and strengthening our core competitiveness and credibility among media brands. Meanwhile, Sohu Video continues to provide users with unique, high-quality dramas and shows. We have seen the positive effects of this differential development strategy and stable improvements in monetization at both Sohu Media and Sohu Video. We hope to see further progress in the coming quarters. In the second quarter of 2019, Sogou achieved steady growth in its core search business while Sogou Mobile Keyboard further expanded its user base and contributed a larger portion to total revenues. As for Changyou, both its revenue and profit exceeded expectations, excluding the aforementioned charge for impairment. Changyou is demonstrating a stable profitability while developing more games to provide a diversified product portfolio."Second Quarter Financial Results RevenuesTotal revenues for the second quarter of 2019 were US$475 million, down 2% year-over-year and up 10% quarter-over-quarter.Total online advertising revenues, which include revenues from the brand advertising and search and search-related advertising businesses, for the second quarter of 2019 were US$320 million, down 4% year-over-year and up 15% quarter-over-quarter.Brand advertising revenues for the second quarter of 2019 totaled US$44 million, down 29% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to decreases in portal and video advertising revenues.Search and search-related advertising revenues for the second quarter of 2019 were US$276 million, up 2% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter.Online game revenues for the second quarter of 2019 were US$102 million, up 8% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year increase was due to the improved performance of some of the Changyou's older games as a result of some promotional activities during the quarter.Gross MarginBoth GAAP and non-GAAP[3] gross margin was 43% for the second quarter of 2019, compared with 44% in the second quarter of 2018 and 40% in the first quarter of 2019.Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for the online advertising business for the second quarter of 2019 was 33%, compared with 35% in the second quarter of 2018 and 23% in the first quarter of 2019.GAAP gross margin for the brand advertising business in the second quarter of 2019 was 29%, compared with 23% in the second quarter of 2018 and 20% in the first quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin for the brand advertising business was 28%, compared with 23% in the second quarter of 2018 and 20% in the first quarter of 2019. The margin improvement was mainly due to decreased video content cost.Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for the search and search-related advertising business in the second quarter of 2019 was 34%, compared with 38% in the second quarter of 2018 and 24% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from the growth of traffic acquisition cost outpacing revenue growth. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to seasonal factors.Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for online games in the second quarter of 2019 was 82%, compared with 85% in the second quarter of 2018 and 86% in the first quarter of 2019.[3] Non-GAAP results exclude share-based compensation expense; non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards; changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to equity investments with readily determinable fair values; income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions; dividends and deemed dividends to non-controlling preferred shareholders of Sogou; a one-time income tax expense recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the one-time transition tax (the "Toll Charge") imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 (the "TCJA"); the subsequent re-evaluation for the fourth quarter of 2018 and adjustment of the tax expense previously recognized for the Toll Charge; the resulting recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit and recording of an uncertain tax position related to the balance of the Toll Charge; and interest accrued in relation to the previously unrecognized tax benefit. Explanation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations to GAAP financial measures are included in the accompanying "Non-GAAP Disclosure" and "Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Results of Operation Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures."Operating ExpensesFor the second quarter of 2019, GAAP operating expenses totaled US$242 million, down 1% year-over-year and up 12% quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were US$238 million, down 2% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due to a charge for impairment of assets of US$17 million related to Changyou's cinema advertising business.Operating LossGAAP operating loss for the second quarter of 2019 was US$38 million, compared with an operating loss of US$32 million in the second quarter of 2018 and an operating loss of US$46 million in the first quarter of 2019.Non-GAAP operating loss for the second quarter of 2019 was US$34 million, compared with an operating loss of US$31 million in the second quarter of 2018 and an operating loss of US$44 million in the first quarter of 2019.Income Tax ExpenseGAAP income tax expense was US$4 million for the second quarter of 2019, compared with income tax expense of US$6 million in the second quarter of 2018 and income tax expense of US$11 million in the first quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP income tax expense was US$2 million for the second quarter of 2019, compared with income tax expense of US$6 million in the second quarter of 2018 and income tax expense of US$9 million in the first quarter of 2019. Income tax expense in the second quarter of 2019 included a tax benefit from Sogou's tax filing adjustment of income tax expense previously recognized, which was due to a reduction in taxable income related to Chinese government initiatives to encourage investment in R&D.Net LossGAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited for the second quarter of 2019 was US$53 million, or US$1.35 loss per fully-diluted ADS, compared with a net loss of US$48 million in the second quarter of 2018 and a net loss of US$57 million in the first quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited for the second quarter of 2019 was US$50 million, or US$1.27 loss per fully-diluted ADS, compared with a net loss of US$49 million in the second quarter of 2018 and a net loss of US$55 million in the first quarter of 2019.LiquidityAs of June 30, 2019, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by the Sohu Group, minus short-term bank loans, were US$1.56 billion, compared with US$1.73 billion as of December 31, 2018.Recent DevelopmentSogou today announced that on August 3, 2019, its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to US$50 million of the outstanding American depositary shares, or ADSs, of Sogou over the next twelve months. The ADSs may be purchased from time to time at management's discretion at prevailing market prices in accordance with Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Sogou's management will determine the timing and amount of any purchases of Sogou ADSs based on their evaluation of market conditions, the trading price of Sogou's ADSs and other factors. The purchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Sogou plans to fund repurchases from its existing cash balance.Business OutlookFor the third quarter of 2019, Sohu estimates:Total revenues to be between US$445 million and US$470 million. Brand advertising revenues to be between US$45 million and US$50 million; this implies an annual decrease of 12% to 21% and a sequential increase of 2% to 14%. Sogou revenues to be between US$304 million and US$314 million; this implies an annual increase of 10% to 14% and a sequential increase of nil to 3%. Online game revenues to be between US$80 million and US$90 million; this implies an annual decrease of 6% to 17 % and a sequential decrease of 12% to 22%. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited. to be between US$22 million and US$32 million, and non-GAAP loss per fully-diluted ADS to be between US$0.55 and US$0.80. GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited to be between US$25 million and US$35 million, and GAAP loss per fully-diluted ADS to be between US$0.65 and US$0.90. Excluding the profit/loss generated by Sogou and Changyou, Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited. to be between US$50 million and US$55 million, GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited to be between US$53million and US$58 million.For the third quarter 2019 guidance, the Company has adopted a presumed exchange rate of RMB6.90=US$1.00, as compared with the actual exchange rate of approximately RMB6.80=US$1.00 for the third quarter of 2018, and RMB6.81=US$1.00 for the second quarter of 2019.Non-GAAP DisclosureTo supplement the unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), Sohu's management uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating profit, net income, net income attributable to Sohu.com Limited and diluted net income attributable to Sohu.com Limited per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of the share-based awards, which consist mainly of share-based compensation expenses and non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards;  changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to equity investments with readily determinable fair values; income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions; dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders; the one-time income tax expense recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the Toll Charge imposed by the TCJA and the subsequent re-evaluation for the fourth quarter of 2018 and adjustment of the tax expense previously recognized for the Toll Charge; the resulting recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit and recording of an uncertain tax position related to the balance of the Toll Charge; and interest expense recognize in connection with the Toll Charge. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.Sohu's management believes excluding share-based compensation expense,  changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to equity investments with readily determinable fair values; non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards; income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions; dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders; and income tax expense, income tax benefit, uncertain tax position, and interest recognized in relation to the Toll Charge from its non-GAAP financial measure is useful for itself and investors. Further, the impact of share-based compensation expense and  changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to equity investments with readily determinable fair values; non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards; income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions; dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders; the one-time income tax expense recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the Toll Charge imposed by the TCJA and the subsequent re-evaluation for the fourth quarter of 2018 and adjustment of the tax expense previously recognized for the Toll Charge; the resulting recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit and recording of an uncertain tax position related to the balance of the Toll Charge; and interest expense recognized in connection with the Toll Charge cannot be anticipated by management and business line leaders and these expenses were not built into the annual budgets and quarterly forecasts that have been the basis for information Sohu provides to analysts and investors as guidance for future operating performance. As the impact of share-based compensation expense and changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to equity investments with readily determinable fair values, non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions, and dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders does not involve subsequent cash outflow or is reflected in the cash flows at the equity transaction level, Sohu does not factor this impact in when evaluating and approving expenditures or when determining the allocation of its resources to its business segments. As a result, in general, the monthly financial results for internal reporting and any performance measures for commissions and bonuses are based on non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation expense and  changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to equity investments with readily determinable fair values, non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions, and dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders, and also excluded the one-time income tax expense recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the Toll Charge imposed by the TCJA and the subsequent re-evaluation for the fourth quarter of 2018 and adjustment of the tax expense previously recognized for the Toll Charge, the resulting recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit and recording of an uncertain tax position related to the balance of the Toll Charge, and interest expense recognized in connection with the Toll Charge.The non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of Sohu's current financial performance and prospects for the future. A limitation of using non-GAAP gross profit, operating profit, net income, net income attributable to Sohu.com Limited and diluted net income attributable to Sohu.com Limited per share, excluding share-based compensation expense, non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions, dividend, and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders is that the impact of share-based awards and non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards has been and will continue to be a significant recurring expense in Sohu's business for the foreseeable future, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions may recur in the future, and dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders may recur when Sohu and its affiliates enter into equity transactions. In order to mitigate these limitations Sohu has provided specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables include details on the reconciliation between the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures that have been presented.Notes to Financial InformationFinancial information in this press release other than the information indicated as being non-GAAP is derived from Sohu's unaudited interim financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.Safe Harbor StatementThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

The Company took a $0.9 million impairment charge for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 for the remaining capitalized technology supporting JPM originations.07:56WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -0.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -4.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value ahead of an eventful week on Wall Street. The week will feature the FOMC's rate decision on Wednesday, the July employment report on Friday, and earnings reports throughout the week.U.S.-China trade talks will also resume on Tuesday for a two-day meeting in Beijing, but expectations for the high-level meeting are low. On the other hand, the Fed will kick off its two-day policy meeting tomorrow, and expectations are high for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting.It isn't too surprising to see some hesitation this morning ahead of these potential market-moving events, especially after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit new all-time highs on Friday. Also, while there will be no notable economic data released today, there are some health care corporate news for investors to parse through.Dow component Pfizer (PFE 42.45, -0.64, -1.5%) missed revenue estimates and lowered its full-year guidance to reflect anticipated completions of prior acquisitions.

The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield are down three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.05%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.11. WTI crude is up 0.1% to $56.23/bbl.In U.S. Corporate news:Pfizer (PFE 42.45, -0.64): -1.5% after missing revenue estimates and lowering its guidance for FY19 to reflect prior acquisitions. Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.55, +3.09): +16.7% after agreeing to combine with Pfizer's off-patent branded and generic established medicines business. Pfizer shareholders will own 57% of the combined company, while Mylan shareholders will own 43%.

Dr. Frost has undergone a successful surgery, and he is expected to make a full recovery. Dr. Frost has been in regular contact with Company management and members of the Board of Directors during his hospitalization, and the Company is continuing to operate normally. The Company will provide further details as appropriate. In the meantime, the OPKO family wishes Dr. Frost a speedy recovery.Separately, as previously announced on June 20, 2019, the Company submitted a de novo request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") seeking regulatory clearance for the 4Kscore test. The Company plans to refile its 4Kscore test submission as a premarket approval ("PMA") application. A PMA submission is the review process used by the FDA to evaluate the approvability of Class III medical devices. The decision to submit the 4Kscore test as a PMA submission is based on FDA feedback to the Company's de novo request for this test, which has now been withdrawn. The FDA did not request any additional clinical data or any additional clinical trials in connection with a PMA submission. The Company currently anticipates submitting the PMA application in August 2019.07:30SUMRX European Markets Update: DAX +0.1%, FTSE +1.5%, CAC -0.1%Major European indices trade near their flat lines while the U.K.'s FTSE (+1.5%) outperforms, rising to a fresh high for the year as the pound hits its lowest level in more than two years.

There was little fanfare coming out of the weekend thus the activity levels have been low. The S&P Futures represent this theme well with only a 6-handle range for the session. Spoos are currently trading around the 3023 level with an overnight high of 3026.00, while the low currently sits at 3020.00.In Asia, both China and Japan closed the day faintly lower. The Shanghai was crimped by the state release of the June Industrial Profits, which showed a decline of 3.1% for the month. Japanese shares struggled to maintain higher ground with the yen strengthening against the dollar. This kept a lid on many of the larger export stocks. On a positive note, June Retail Sales topped expectations with a rise of 0.5%, compared to +0.2% consensus. In Europe, the major bourses are mixed with Germany and France trading lower, while the FTSE is up 1%. The CAC and DAX are echoing the tone seen in Asia and the US. The FTSE had been a laggard all last week, so some of the gains appear to be a bounce in response to that. Also, the pound hit a fresh 2-year low against the greenback, lending support to equities.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -4.010 yr Note: 2.06%USD/JPY: 108.62 -0.01EUR/USD: 1.1123 -0.0001Europe: FTSE +1.0% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.3%Asia: Hang Seng -1.0% Shanghai -0.1% Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1418.70 -0.60) Silver (16.39 -0.01) Crude (56.22 +0.02)17:50WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ANIK (55.85 +37.49%), GHDX (68.66 +22.67%), SLDB (5.82 +22.27%), THC (22.01 +21.74%)Materials: CSTM (12.66 +23.87%)Industrials: UPS (120.58 +16.72%)Consumer Discretionary: SNBR (49.43 +23.11%), MTH (64.81 +19.33%), MAT (14.17 +18.18%)Information Technology: NTGR (34.25 +28.71%), MANH (88.44 +24.34%), TER (56.35 +22.61%), TYPE (20 +19.55%), TTD (278.55 +18.38%)Financials: EHTH (108.4 +24.83%), LOB (20.37 +24.36%), ENVA (25.23 +18.51%)Consumer Staples: VGR (11.15 +16.88%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ALGN (198.84 -29.29%), ITCI (8.37 -29.19%), MMSI (41 -25.48%), DVAX (2.8 -23.5%), LNTH (22.77 -19.43%), GLYC (9.18 -17.82%), NXGN (16.31 -16.7%)Industrials: FIX (41.64 -20.23%), HCSG (24.86 -17.98%)Consumer Discretionary: IRBT (74.51 -17.61%), TUP (14.81 -17.58%)Information Technology: CARB (18.01 -27.5%), PTC (73.36 -16.63%)Energy: BPT (9.08 -30.21%), REI (2.41 -18.86%), UNT (6.32 -16.73%), SWN (2.04 -16.39%)Consumer Staples: TPB (41.86 -21.83%)Utilities: JE (3.6 -18.18%)17:49RECN Resources Connection approved an 8% increase in its cash dividend to $0.14 per share on co's common stock (17.00 +0.10)17:32EW Edwards Lifesciences files mixed securities shelf offering (212.85 +0.38)17:25PSXP Phillips 66 Partners also files mixed securities shelf offering (52.87 -1.08)17:22PSX Phillips 66 files mixed securities shelf offering (102.32 +0.75)17:20DOW Dow files mixed securities shelf offering (49.11 -1.66)17:19LXRX Lexicon Pharma provides preliminary update for Zynquista (Sotagliflozin) Type 2 Diabetes Phase 3 program; Sanofi (SNY) provides disputed termination notice; LXRX will provide update during earnings call Aug 1 at 8 a.m. ET (5.69 +0.08)The co received preliminary topline results from Sanofi for three Phase 3 trials of Zynquista (sotagliflozin) in adults living with type 2 diabetes from the InSynchrony clinical program.

"While we are disappointed in the position taken by Sanofi, we are confident in the strength of the data we have seen thus far in the type 2 diabetes program and are optimistic about achieving continued success in the balance of the core Phase 3 program, which we expect will be completed in the coming months... In the event of a valid termination of the Sanofi alliance, we will also look forward to regaining full rights to Zynquista in type 1 diabetes in the United States, as well as rights in the remainder of the world, notably including the European Union, in which Zynquista has already received approval."17:13KRP Kimbell Royalty Partners declares increased cash distribution of $0.39 per common unit, prior $0.37 per unit (16.10 +0.35)17:09CDLX Cardlytics files for $100 mln mixed securities shelf offering and 4 mln share common stock offering by holders (29.06 +0.55)16:31XXII 22nd Century Group CEO Henry Sicignano III has resigned for personal reasons, effective July 26 (1.86 -0.01)Mr. Sicignano will continue to serve the Company, on a consultancy basis, for the next several years.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD16:15APC Anadarko Petroleum misses by $0.04, beats on revs (73.62 +0.15)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.51 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.04 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.55; revenues rose 4.6% year/year to $3.44 bln vs the $3.31 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -4.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value ahead of an eventful week on Wall Street. The week will feature the FOMC's rate decision on Wednesday, the July employment report on Friday, and earnings reports throughout the week.U.S.-China trade talks will also resume on Tuesday for a two-day meeting in Beijing, but expectations for the high-level meeting are low. On the other hand, the Fed will kick off its two-day policy meeting tomorrow, and expectations are high for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting.It isn't too surprising to see some hesitation this morning ahead of these potential market-moving events, especially after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit new all-time highs on Friday. Also, while there will be no notable economic data released today, there are some health care corporate news for investors to parse through.Dow component Pfizer (PFE 42.45, -0.64, -1.5%) missed revenue estimates and lowered its full-year guidance to reflect anticipated completions of prior acquisitions.

There was little fanfare coming out of the weekend thus the activity levels have been low. The S&P Futures represent this theme well with only a 6-handle range for the session. Spoos are currently trading around the 3023 level with an overnight high of 3026.00, while the low currently sits at 3020.00.In Asia, both China and Japan closed the day faintly lower. The Shanghai was crimped by the state release of the June Industrial Profits, which showed a decline of 3.1% for the month. Japanese shares struggled to maintain higher ground with the yen strengthening against the dollar. This kept a lid on many of the larger export stocks. On a positive note, June Retail Sales topped expectations with a rise of 0.5%, compared to +0.2% consensus. In Europe, the major bourses are mixed with Germany and France trading lower, while the FTSE is up 1%. The CAC and DAX are echoing the tone seen in Asia and the US.

Also, the pound hit a fresh 2-year low against the greenback, lending support to equities.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -4.010 yr Note: 2.06%USD/JPY: 108.62 -0.01EUR/USD: 1.1123 -0.0001Europe: FTSE +1.0% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.3%Asia: Hang Seng -1.0% Shanghai -0.1% Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1418.70 -0.60) Silver (16.39 -0.01) Crude (56.22 +0.02)17:50WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ANIK (55.85 +37.49%), GHDX (68.66 +22.67%), SLDB (5.82 +22.27%), THC (22.01 +21.74%)Materials: CSTM (12.66 +23.87%)Industrials: UPS (120.58 +16.72%)Consumer Discretionary: SNBR (49.43 +23.11%), MTH (64.81 +19.33%), MAT (14.17 +18.18%)Information Technology: NTGR (34.25 +28.71%), MANH (88.44 +24.34%), TER (56.35 +22.61%), TYPE (20 +19.55%), TTD (278.55 +18.38%)Financials: EHTH (108.4 +24.83%), LOB (20.37 +24.36%), ENVA (25.23 +18.51%)Consumer Staples: VGR (11.15 +16.88%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ALGN (198.84 -29.29%), ITCI (8.37 -29.19%), MMSI (41 -25.48%), DVAX (2.8 -23.5%), LNTH (22.77 -19.43%), GLYC (9.18 -17.82%), NXGN (16.31 -16.7%)Industrials: FIX (41.64 -20.23%), HCSG (24.86 -17.98%)Consumer Discretionary: IRBT (74.51 -17.61%), TUP (14.81 -17.58%)Information Technology: CARB (18.01 -27.5%), PTC (73.36 -16.63%)Energy: BPT (9.08 -30.21%), REI (2.41 -18.86%), UNT (6.32 -16.73%), SWN (2.04 -16.39%)Consumer Staples: TPB (41.86 -21.83%)Utilities: JE (3.6 -18.18%)17:49RECN Resources Connection approved an 8% increase in its cash dividend to $0.14 per share on co's common stock (17.00 +0.10)17:32EW Edwards Lifesciences files mixed securities shelf offering (212.85 +0.38)17:25PSXP Phillips 66 Partners also files mixed securities shelf offering (52.87 -1.08)17:22PSX Phillips 66 files mixed securities shelf offering (102.32 +0.75)17:20DOW Dow files mixed securities shelf offering (49.11 -1.66)17:19LXRX Lexicon Pharma provides preliminary update for Zynquista (Sotagliflozin) Type 2 Diabetes Phase 3 program; Sanofi (SNY) provides disputed termination notice; LXRX will provide update during earnings call Aug 1 at 8 a.m. ET (5.69 +0.08)The co received preliminary topline results from Sanofi for three Phase 3 trials of Zynquista (sotagliflozin) in adults living with type 2 diabetes from the InSynchrony clinical program.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD16:15APC Anadarko Petroleum misses by $0.04, beats on revs (73.62 +0.15)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.51 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.04 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.55; revenues rose 4.6% year/year to $3.44 bln vs the $3.31 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Trump huddles with tech CEOs as White House vacillates on HuaweiPolitico.comJuly 22, 2019 Monday 8:29 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 584 wordsByline: soverly@politico.com,  (Steven Overly)BodyPresident Donald Trump huddled with the chief executives of seven technology companies, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, at the White House Monday as his administration delivers wildly mixed messages on Chinese telecom company Huawei amid preparations for the next round of trade talks with China. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow convened the meeting to discuss a range of economic issues, but the guest list was entirely composed of semiconductor and software companies that count Huawei, the world's largest telecom equipment maker, as one of their customers.The president agreed during the meeting to an industry request that the Commerce Department provide "timely licensing decisions" on sales to Huawei, White House spokesperson Judd Deere said. Trump's Commerce Department in May added Huawei to a trade blacklist, requiring U.S. companies to get a special license before they can do business with the telecom titan.Under the terms of the trade blacklist, that license comes with the presumption of denial, meaning it's normally all but impossible to obtain. Trump, however, has suggested the possibility of easing restrictions on Huawei as a concession to Beijing amid efforts to navigate the ongoing trade war with China. He most recently said some sales to the company could resume after he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Japan last month. The group that convened Monday also discussed job numbers, international trade issues and 5G technology, Deere said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also attended, a source familiar with the meeting told POLITICO. The CEOs of Intel, Cisco, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Micron and Western Digital rounded out the guest list.Trump's feints at easing up on Huawei have drawn the ire of China hawks in both parties who fear the president could choose a trade deal over national security. Policymakers have long been concerned the company is in cahoots with the Chinese government. Indeed, a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation last week that would prevent Trump from removing Huawei from the trade blacklist until security concerns have been addressed. Meanwhile, companies have been stuck in trade limbo. Huawei is a major buyer of semiconductors and software produced by U.S. companies, and some of them have warned that losing the company as a customer would take a serious toll on their bottom lines. Broadcom, for instance, reported in June that it expects annual sales to drop $2 billion as a result of the ban.  Companies have sought more clarity from the administration on what technology is restricted, and have already resumed some sales. Huawei has also pushed back on the U.S.'s efforts to contain its business. In March, the company sued the federal government, arguing that Congress acted unconstitutionally when it passed a law last year banning federal agencies and their contractors from buying Huawei equipment. The company's reclusive founder, Ren Zhengfei, has denied ties to the Chinese government in several media interviews. His stepped-up defense of the company came after the Justice Department filed charges against the firm and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over allegations of fraud, obstruction of justice and sanctions violations. Wanzhou, who now faces extradition from Canada to the U.S., is Ren's daughter.Adam Behsudi contributed to this report.Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: July 23, 2019End of Document

China says it released Uyghur ethnic minorities from internment campsUPIJuly 30, 2019 Tuesday 7:30 PM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 330 wordsByline: DANIEL URIADateline: July 30 BodyChina announced Tuesday that it released up to 1 million or more people from a predominantly Muslim ethnic group held in internment camps, prompting skepticism from activists.The U.S. State Department said up to 2 million members of the Uyghur and other majority Muslim ethnic minorities have been detained against their will in internment camps in the region of Xinjiang during the past two years.During a press conference in Beijing on Tuesday, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Chairman Shohrat Zakir defended the camps and announced that most of the people held in them have "gone back to society.""I can say 90 percent of them have found suitable and enjoyable jobs that bring them considerable income," he said.Zakir said the camps are "vocational training centers" and not "concentration camps as called by some people."He did not provide evidence of the releases, nor did he specifically state how many people had been released, saying "people arrive and leave constantly."U.S.-based Uyghur activist Tahir Imin told The New York Times that other Uyghurs living internationally hadn't found evidence of the widespread releases."Uyghurs abroad continue to be unable to reach their relatives in the region. No phone calls, no Internet communications," Imin said. "If the Chinese government is honest and confident in what it's saying to the media, it should allow people to communicate freely and go out of the country freely and allow independent media to visit and investigate freely."'s Asia Regional Director Nicholas Bequelin issued a statement accusing China of making "deceptive and unverifiable statements" in order to quell concerns about the detentions of Uyghurs."Given China's record of heavy censorship, outright falsehoods and systematic obfuscation about the situation in Xinjiang, it remains imperative that U.N. human rights investigators, independent observers and the media be given unrestricted access to the region as a matter of urgency," Bequelin said.Load-Date: July 31, 2019End of Document

UK LAWMAKER PROPOSES BILL FOR RECIPROCAL ACCESS TO TIBETStates News ServiceJuly 24, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 613 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A British lawmaker submitted a bill to the House of Commons this week that would bar entry to the UK for any Chinese officials found to block freedom of travel to Tibet by British citizens.The bill submitted by Conservative Party MP Tim Loughton on Tuesday mirrors a similar bill now passed into law in the U.S., and requires that a report be made to Parliament each year, listing instances where British politicians, diplomats, and other travelers have been denied entry to Tibet."My Bill would emulate in the UK what the US has done," Loughton, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Tibet, said on a video clip posted on Facebook on Tuesday, citing concerns over what he called China's "horrendous human rights abuses" in the Himalayan region."To say to China: You need to open up, we need to expose these human rights abuses. You need to treat Tibetans fairly around the world and within China itself, and if you don't, don't expect the people responsible for that to be able to come to the UK," he said."It may seem like a remote issue, but it's an important principle for human rights of minorities throughout the world," Loughton said. "And the Tibetans have suffered for far too long."Details on when Loughton's bill will come up for debate in the Parliament were not immediately available.'A positive move'Speaking on Wednesday to RFA's Tibetan Service, London-based Free Tibet campaign advocacy manager John Jones welcomed the submission of Loughton's bill to the UK Parliament."We think it is a positive move. We were excited when the Reciprocal Access bill had success in the U.S., and we thought it was good for other countries to replicate that, to send a message to the Chinese government," Jones said."If they are going to impose travel restrictions on people from the UK to Tibet, then those people imposing the restrictions need to be held accountable themselves."In a move pushing for greater U.S. access to Tibet, now largely closed by China to American diplomats and journalists, President Donald Trump on Dec. 20, 2018 signed into law a bill denying visas to Chinese officials responsible for blocking entry to the Beijing-ruled Himalayan region.The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 requires the U.S. Secretary of State to identify Chinese officials responsible for excluding U.S. citizens, including Americans of Tibetan ethnic origin, from China's Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), and then ban them from entering the United States.The law also requires the State Department to provide to the Congress each year a list of U.S. citizens blocked from entry to Tibet.'Wrong signals'Meanwhile, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying slammed Trump's signing of the bill into law, saying the new law sends "seriously wrong signals" of support to what she called forces working to separate Tibet from Chinese rule."If the United States implements this law, it will cause serious harm to China-U.S. relations and to the cooperation in important areas between the two countries," she said.A formerly independent nation, Tibet was taken over and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, following which Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India.Chinese authorities now maintain a tight grip on the region, restricting Tibetans' political activities and peaceful expression of ethnic and religious identities, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.Reported by Guru Choegyi for RFA's Tibetan Service.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company.

Currently, the benchmark index holds a slight loss of 0.2%.Price action has been muted, as investors appear willing to wait for the upcoming trading catalysts this week. Perhaps the most widely expected event, which also happens to be the one with the most widely-expected outcome, is the FOMC's rate decision on Wednesday.The market is expecting at least a 25-basis points rate cut. Fed officials have been concerned about low inflation levels that could be ingrained in the economy should consumers and businesses begin to expect low inflation.14:55 ETDow +40.65 at 27233.1, Nasdaq -37.67 at 8292.54, S&P -4.57 at 3021.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.7%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.4%) has been resilient today, recovering from a lower start to add to its 4.6% gain from last week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Broadly-speaking, there isn't too much conviction in the market today in front of an eventful week. Notable events, among many things, will include the FOMC's rate decision, the July employment report, and U.S.-China trade talks. While trade expectations are low, partly due to President Trump saying he doesn't expect a deal until after the 2020 presidential election, rate-cut expectations are high.In the meantime, widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1898.19, -44.85, -2.3%), Facebook (FB 196.16, -3.58, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1234.91, -15.50, -1.2%) are down noticeably and have contributed to the underperformance of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.9%) and communication services (-0.7%) sectors.There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding from crowded positions that were mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, or a form of profit taking after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following earnings on Friday.On the other hand, the S&P 500 real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors have provided some support for the broader market.In addition, shares of Apple (AAPL 210.06, +2.32, +1.1%) are up over 1% after UBS increased its price target to $235 from $225 ahead of its earnings report after Tuesday's close. Its outperformance has provided influential support for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.05, +2.58, +14.0%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 42.38, -0.71, -1.7%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company.

The Dow is up 0.3%.Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes little to no profit. Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. UK's FTSE climbed 1.8%, as the British pound declined to its lowest level in over two years amid speculation of a no-deal Brexit. Germany's DAX finished flat, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.1%.11:25 ETDow +78.50 at 27270.95, Nasdaq -55.86 at 8274.35, S&P -4.73 at 3021.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%. Contributing to today's slight decline are losses in Facebook (FB 197.27, -2.46, -1.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1901.35, -41.35, -2.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1233.09, -17.32, -1.4%).There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%). Another laggard includes the energy sector (-0.5%) despite oil prices ($56.33, +0.14, +0.3%) ticking higher.10:55 ETDow +49.52 at 27241.97, Nasdaq -57.47 at 8272.74, S&P -6.06 at 3019.8[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2% in a mixed session. The Dow, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Today's price action has shown little conviction in front of an eventful week that will include the FOMC rate decision, the July employment report, U.S.-China trade talks, and another round of earnings reports.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 12.98, +0.82, +6.7%) has increased today but not too noticeably.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters.

The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher.Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close.Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows.The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans.On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index. Investors will also receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, Pending Home Sales for June, and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May.Nasdaq Composite +25.0% YTDS&P 500 +20.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.7% YTDRussell 2000 +16.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1472/1420. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1183/1867.15:25 ETDow +27.19 at 27219.64, Nasdaq -40.72 at 8289.49, S&P -5.98 at 3019.88[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is on pace to end the day slightly below its unchanged mark. Currently, the benchmark index holds a slight loss of 0.2%.Price action has been muted, as investors appear willing to wait for the upcoming trading catalysts this week. Perhaps the most widely expected event, which also happens to be the one with the most widely-expected outcome, is the FOMC's rate decision on Wednesday.The market is expecting at least a 25-basis points rate cut. Fed officials have been concerned about low inflation levels that could be ingrained in the economy should consumers and businesses begin to expect low inflation.14:55 ETDow +40.65 at 27233.1, Nasdaq -37.67 at 8292.54, S&P -4.57 at 3021.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.7%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.4%) has been resilient today, recovering from a lower start to add to its 4.6% gain from last week. Investors haven't been too discouraged by growing expectations that a trade deal with China could still be at least one year away, as suggested by President Trump.Looking ahead, notable companies that will report earnings before tomorrow's open include Beyond Meat (BYND 220.65, -14.11, -5.9%), Procter & Gamble (PG 115.74, +1.01, +0.9%), and Merck (MRK 82.41, +1.00, +1.2%).14:30 ETDow +39.10 at 27231.55, Nasdaq -42.20 at 8288.01, S&P -5.03 at 3020.83[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has trimmed its percentage losses to 0.17% vs 0.38% at today's lows.The S&P 500, although modestly lower, houses some names in the market that show relative strength on Monday. Namely, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 806.72, +26.86, +3.44%), Fiserv (FISV 171.02, +3.72, +2.22%), and CIGNA (CI 104.54, +2.24, +2.19%) all host gains north of 2%. CMG is strong on Monday in reaction to Goldman's initiation and $1000 price target, FISV moves higher after completing its combination with First Data, and CI is higher in sympathy to general gains in managed care names.Conversely, San Francisco-based biotech firm Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 29.44, -1.68, -5.40%). Recall that last week NKTR received a letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the company's mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate, NKTR-181. Delving deeper into the SEC filing NKTR highlighted that the FDA may not be able to meet the PDUFA goal date of August 29, 2019, due to the postponement of the advisory committee meeting.14:00 ETDow +52.15 at 27244.6, Nasdaq -47.65 at 8282.56, S&P -5.27 at 3020.59[BRIEFING.COM] As was the case in our last update, the major averages haven't shifted much. The Nasdaq Composite still posts the worst losses, down 0.57%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosts the only gains, up 0.19%, with the S&P 500 landing in the middle, down 0.17%.Gold futures settled less than 0.1% higher on Monday at $1,420.40/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index, too, moves less than 0.1% higher on Monday at 98.07.13:30 ETDow +66.00 at 27258.45, Nasdaq -45.11 at 8285.1, S&P -4.32 at 3021.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have held their lines in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still in the lead, up 0.24%.Action in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is modestly higher with names like 3M (MMM 176.97, +2.99, +1.72%), Intel (INTC 52.42, +0.83, +1.61%), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 132.74, +2.01, +1.54%) providing upside. MMM gains after news that the company had settled a paint spray technology patent dispute with Saint-Gobain Abrasives Inc.Conversely, healthcare product company Pfizer (PFE 42.21, -0.88, -2.04%) sits at the bottom of the index after the company announced a definitive agreement to combine its Upjohn business with Mylan (MYL 21.00, +2.54, +13.76%).The DJIA starts the week out on a high note, now up some 2.47% on the month.12:55 ETDow +42.88 at 27235.33, Nasdaq -50.63 at 8279.58, S&P -6.12 at 3019.74[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed today with the S&P 500 (-0.2%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.6%) both down following record-setting performances on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Broadly-speaking, there isn't too much conviction in the market today in front of an eventful week. Notable events, among many things, will include the FOMC's rate decision, the July employment report, and U.S.-China trade talks. While trade expectations are low, partly due to President Trump saying he doesn't expect a deal until after the 2020 presidential election, rate-cut expectations are high.In the meantime, widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1898.19, -44.85, -2.3%), Facebook (FB 196.16, -3.58, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1234.91, -15.50, -1.2%) are down noticeably and have contributed to the underperformance of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.9%) and communication services (-0.7%) sectors.There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding from crowded positions that were mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, or a form of profit taking after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following earnings on Friday.On the other hand, the S&P 500 real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors have provided some support for the broader market.In addition, shares of Apple (AAPL 210.06, +2.32, +1.1%) are up over 1% after UBS increased its price target to $235 from $225 ahead of its earnings report after Tuesday's close. Its outperformance has provided influential support for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.05, +2.58, +14.0%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 42.38, -0.71, -1.7%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates, while Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.Investors did not receive any notable economic data today.12:25 ETDow +41.54 at 27233.99, Nasdaq -58.40 at 8271.81, S&P -7.25 at 3018.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.2% and has wavered in negative territory all session.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 210.41, +2.67, +1.3%) as the lone stock trading higher after its price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS ahead of its earnings report.Amazon (AMZN 1893.55, -50.60, -2.6%) is down more than 2.5% followed by Facebook (FB 196.01, -3.74, -1.9%), Netflix (NFLX 331.38, -4.40, -1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1232.45, -17.96, -1.4%), which are also down noticieably. Fellow mega-cap stock Microsoft (MSFT 140.53, -0.81) is down 0.6%.12:00 ETDow +71.62 at 27264.07, Nasdaq -48.35 at 8281.86, S&P -3.73 at 3022.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade mixed, but the S&P 500 (-0.1%) and Nasdaq (-0.6%) are off their session lows. The Dow is up 0.3%.Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes little to no profit. Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. UK's FTSE climbed 1.8%, as the British pound declined to its lowest level in over two years amid speculation of a no-deal Brexit. Germany's DAX finished flat, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.1%.11:25 ETDow +78.50 at 27270.95, Nasdaq -55.86 at 8274.35, S&P -4.73 at 3021.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%. Contributing to today's slight decline are losses in Facebook (FB 197.27, -2.46, -1.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1901.35, -41.35, -2.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1233.09, -17.32, -1.4%).There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%). Another laggard includes the energy sector (-0.5%) despite oil prices ($56.33, +0.14, +0.3%) ticking higher.10:55 ETDow +49.52 at 27241.97, Nasdaq -57.47 at 8272.74, S&P -6.06 at 3019.8[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2% in a mixed session. The Dow, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Today's price action has shown little conviction in front of an eventful week that will include the FOMC rate decision, the July employment report, U.S.-China trade talks, and another round of earnings reports.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 12.98, +0.82, +6.7%) has increased today but not too noticeably. The VIX could be something to keep an eye on, especially with the aforementioned events coming up.10:30 ETDow +28.56 at 27221.01, Nasdaq -68.49 at 8261.72, S&P -7.58 at 3018.28[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are higher (+0.04% at 78.77 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.10)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now -$0.06 (-0.1%) at $56.17/barrelAug natural gas is -$0.04 (-2.2%) at $2.10/MMBtu.Moving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$0.40 at $1419.17/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.01 (+0.1%) at $16.41/ozSept copper is now +$0.02 (+0.7%) at $2.70/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1138/1568. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1076/1828.09:55 ETDow +16.02 at 27208.47, Nasdaq -51.66 at 8278.55, S&P -7.46 at 3018.4[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.2%.Shares of Mylan N.V.

China's Securities Regulatory Commission suspended more than 40 IPOs due to a concern that the country's second largest auditor falsified information regarding these listings.

On the other hand, the Fed will kick off its two-day policy meeting tomorrow, and expectations are high for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting.It isn't too surprising to see some hesitation this morning ahead of these potential market-moving events, especially after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit new all-time highs on Friday.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1963/922. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2099/928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

No Headline In OriginalCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 23, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 526 wordsBodyWashington, 23 Aug (EFE). - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday confirmed two tariff ups against China after slaying a stock market crisis by urging U.S. companies to abandon their operations in the Asian giant.Trump announced that from October 1, he will increase the levies on $250 billion of goods and goods from 25 percent to 30 percent.In addition, from 1 September, tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports will rise from 10% to 15%.Washington imposed these measures after the Chinese government on Friday complied with its threats and announced the imposition of tariffs on U.S. goods worth $75 billion, also in response to other U.S. levies announced to early August.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said tariffs will begin to apply on September 1, the same date that US power's tariffs on Asian giant products will come into effect for $300 billion.Trump announced tariff hikes after the close of stock markets on Wall Street, which experienced this day sharp declines after the representative urged U.S. companies to abandon their operations in the Asian giant.Industriales' Dow Jones, the main indicator, was down 2.37%, while the S&P; index fell 2.59%, and the Nasdaq, where the major technology groups trade, lost 3% on a day."Our large U.S. companies have orders to start looking for an alternative to China, including the ability to bring their companies back to CASA and make their products in the U.S.," the representative said in the morning."We don't need China," he added, "and, frankly, we'd be much better off without it. The vast amount of money earned and stolen by China from the United States, year after year, for decades, must and will end."The president also brought Chinese President Xi Jinping and Fed Chief Jerome Powell to the same level as "enemies" after he avoided making a standon on the next steps in monetary policy in a speech on Friday."My only question is who is our worst enemy, Jay Powell or President Xi?" said Trump on Twitter.With the stock market crash and before leaving tonight for the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump announced the levy, leaving the crisis open.Trump argued in a statement that "for many years" China and other countries "have taken advantage of the United States in trade, intellectual property theft and more."The representative also considered that the governments that preceded him in the U.S. "have allowed China to take advantage" and that, he says, has become a "big burden" to the taxpayer."As president, I can no longer allow this to happen! In the spirit of achieving fair trade, we must balance this very unfair trade relationship," he added.The trade war with China, triggered by Trump's aggressive protectionism since coming to power in January 2017, peaked in May with the imposition of a 25% tariff on Chinese imports worth $250 billion, nearly half of the total.To this, Beijing responded by the application of levies similar to 110 billiondollars in U.S. imports.With his trade war, Trump has set a goal of balancing trade between the two countries, broadly favorable to China, but so far, despite the imposition of tariffs, it has had little or no results.Load-Date: August 25, 2019End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 4663 wordsBodyStock market closes mixed; muted price action with possible market-moving catalysts later this weekRelative strength in the defensive-oriented sectors; Apple (AAPL) outperforms after UBS increases its price targetNasdaq Composite, S&P 500 slip from record highsStock market slips from record highs in front of eventful week - Jul 29 - 16:15 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 lost 0.2% on Monday, slipping from record highs in a lackluster session. The Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) and Russell 2000 (-0.6%) both underperformed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) managed to finish higher. Monday's session didn't include much price action, as investors appeared to be waiting for several key events later this week. Some of these events will include the FOMC's rate decision, U.S.-China trade talks, the July employment report, and Apple's (AAPL 209.68, +1.94, +0.9%) earnings report. On a related note, Apple's price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS before its results after Tuesday's close. Apple shares rose on the increased price target, but the broader market was still weighed down by widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1912.45, -30.60, -1.6%), Facebook (FB 195.94, -3.81, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1239.41, -11.00, -0.9%). In turn, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%) and communication services (-0.5%) sectors were among today's laggards but, like the broader market, finished the session off intraday lows. The S&P 500 financials sector (-0.8%) succumbed to broad-based selling interest throughout the day. Wells Fargo (WFC 48.28, -1.02, -2.1%) was a notable laggard amid a Wall Street Journal report indicating that the Trump administration plans to make it harder for deeply indebted borrowers to acquire mortgage loans. On the other hand, the S&P 500 defensive-oriented sectors -- utilities (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.3%) -- were the lone sectors that finished higher. Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 20.78, +2.32, +12.6%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.45, -1.64, -3.8%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates; Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.U.S. Treasuries finished the session higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield  and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.06%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat at 98.04. WTI crude increased 1.2% to $56.87/bbl. Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Looking ahead, Tuesday will feature the Personal Income and Spending report for June, which will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index. Investors will also receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, Pending Home Sales for June, and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May.• Nasdaq Composite +25.0% YTD• S&P 500 +20.5% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +16.7% YTD• Russell 2000 +16.4% YTDNASDAQ - 1183 - 1867 - 1.9 blnNYSE - 1472 - 1420 - 743.6 mlnDJ30 - +28.90 - 27221.35NASDAQ - -36.88 - 8293.33SP500 - -4.89 - 3020.97Eyeing the Fed - Jul 29 - 15:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is on pace to end the day slightly below its unchanged mark. Currently, the benchmark index holds a slight loss of 0.2%.Price action has been muted, as investors appear willing to wait for the upcoming trading catalysts this week. Perhaps the most widely expected event, which also happens to be the one with the most widely-expected outcome, is the FOMC's rate decision on Wednesday. The market is expecting at least a 25-basis points rate cut. Fed officials have been concerned about low inflation levels that could be ingrained in the economy should consumers and businesses begin to expect low inflation. NASDAQ - 1237 - 1805 - 1.4 blnNYSE - 1436 - 1466 - 384.6 mlnDJ30 - +27.19 - 27219.64NASDAQ - -40.72 - 8289.49SP500 - -5.98 - 3019.88Resiliency in the semiconductor space - Jul 29 - 14:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.7%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.4%) has been resilient today, recovering from a lower start to add to its 4.6% gain from last week. Investors haven't been too discouraged by growing expectations that a trade deal with China could still be at least one year away, as suggested by President Trump. Looking ahead, notable companies that will report earnings before tomorrow's open include Beyond Meat (BYND 220.65, -14.11, -5.9%), Procter & Gamble (PG 115.74, +1.01, +0.9%), and Merck (MRK 82.41, +1.00, +1.2%). NASDAQ - 1205 - 1817 - 1.3 blnNYSE - 1423 - 1474 - 353.3 mlnDJ30 - +40.65 - 27233.1NASDAQ - -37.67 - 8292.54SP500 - -4.57 - 3021.29Solemnly Split - Jul 29 - 14:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has trimmed its percentage losses to 0.17% vs 0.38% at today's lows.The S&P 500, although modestly lower, houses some names in the market that show relative strength on Monday. Namely, Chipotle MexicanGrill (CMG 806.72, +26.86, +3.44%), Fiserv (FISV 171.02, +3.72, +2.22%), and CIGNA (CI 104.54, +2.24, +2.19%) all host gains north of 2%. CMG is strong on Monday in reaction to Goldman's initiation and $1000 price target, FISV moves higher after completing its combination with First Data, and CI is higher in sympathy to general gains in managed care names.Conversely, San Francisco-based biotech firm Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 29.44, -1.68, -5.40%). Recall that last week NKTR received a letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the company's mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate, NKTR-181. Delving deeper into the SEC filing NKTR highlighted that the FDA may not be able to meet the PDUFA goal date of August 29, 2019, due to the postponement of the advisory committee meeting.NASDAQ - 1232 - 1788 - 1.20 blnNYSE - 1444 - 1424 - 330.0 mlnDJ30 - +39.10 - 27231.55NASDAQ - -42.20 - 8288.01SP500 - -5.03 - 3020.83Gold Flutters, Little Changed Ahead Of This Week's Fed Decision - Jul 29 - 14:00 ET[BRIEFING.COM] As was the case in our last update, the major averages haven't shifted much.

MMM gains after news that the company had settled a paint spray technology patent dispute with Saint-Gobain Abrasives Inc.Conversely, healthcare product company Pfizer (PFE 42.21, -0.88, -2.04%) sits at the bottom of the index after the company announced a definitive agreement to combine its Upjohn business with Mylan (MYL 21.00, +2.54, +13.76%).The DJIA starts the week out on a high note, now up some 2.47% on the month.NASDAQ - 1179 - 1828 - 1.05 blnNYSE - 1353 - 1506 - 290.0 mlnDJ30 - +66.00 - 27258.45NASDAQ - -45.11 - 8285.1SP500 - -4.32 - 3021.54Stock market trades mixed in front of big week - Jul 29 - 12:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed today with the S&P 500 (-0.2%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.6%) both down following record-setting performances on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%. Broadly-speaking, there isn't too much conviction in the market today in front of an eventful week. Notable events, among many things, will include the FOMC's rate decision, the July employment report, and U.S.-China trade talks. While trade expectations are low, partly due to President Trump saying he doesn't expect a deal until after the 2020 presidential election, rate-cut expectations are high. In the meantime, widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1898.19, -44.85, -2.3%), Facebook (FB 196.16, -3.58, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1234.91, -15.50, -1.2%) are down noticeably and have contributed to the underperformance of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.9%) and communication services (-0.7%) sectors. There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding from crowded positions that were mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, or a form of profit taking after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following earnings on Friday.On the other hand, the S&P 500 real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors have provided some support for the broader market.In addition, shares of Apple (AAPL 210.06, +2.32, +1.1%) are up over 1% after UBS increased its price target to $235 from $225 ahead of its earnings report after Tuesday's close. Its outperformance has provided influential support for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow. Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.05, +2.58, +14.0%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 42.38, -0.71, -1.7%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company.

The Dow is up 0.3%. Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes little to no profit.  Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today. Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%. Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions  include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%).  Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.  Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations. In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%). U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl. Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:• According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.• Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTD• S&P 500 +20.7% YTD• Russell 2000 +17.1% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTDNASDAQ - 2099 - 928 - 1.9 blnNYSE - 1963 - 922 - 736.5 mlnDJ30 - +51.47 - 27192.45NASDAQ - +91.67 - 8330.21SP500 - +22.19 - 3025.86Load-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

US CITIZEN MISTAKEN FOR EXILE TIBETAN OFFICIAL IS DEPORTED FROM NEPALStates News ServiceJuly 5, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 863 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A U.S. citizen of Tibetan origin deported from Nepal last week after being questioned by immigration officers was singled out for harsh treatment because his name matched that on a blacklist provided to Nepalese authorities by China, sources say.Penpa Tsering, who shares the same name as the former Speaker of the India-based Tibetan Parliament in Exile, had just arrived at Nepal's Tribhuvan International Airport after a 17-hour flight from New York when he was pulled aside for interrogation, Tsering told RFA's Tibetan Service in an interview on July 3."The immigration officials ignored my repeated claims of not being the person they were looking for, and instead held me for almost six hours at the airport only to have me deported," Tsering said."It was a perplexing and frightening ordeal for me," he added.While being questioned, Tsering managed to send a text message to family members who were waiting for him outside the airport, telling them he was being held in a case of mistaken identity, Tsering told RFA."And when things got further delayed, I tried to text them again, but the immigration officials snatched my cell phone away. They treated me completely like a criminal," he said."They asked me to remove my hat and eyeglasses to verify if I was the person they were looking for, but even after realizing it wasn't me, they still deported me," Tsering said, adding that the officers holding him conducted an online search of his Facebook accounts, where they found images of the Tibetan national flag, which is banned in China."Also, I served in the Tibetan Government in Exile for more than 20 years," he said.Influence from ChinaTsering said that he blames influence from the Chinese government for his treatment at the airport."After going through all this, I felt I must not let it slide," said Tsering, who was sent back to the U.S. that same day via Qatar Airways and then spent four days in New York before going to Dharamsala, India, to attend a long-life ceremony for exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama."Therefore, I wrote an email to the U.S. Embassy in Nepal informing them of this incident and asking them to investigate the matter further, though I haven't received any response yet.""I am also planning to write to my local representatives and to Congress when I return to the U.S.," he said."I can't stop thinking about this distressing incident, but even more I can't imagine what it must be like for Tibetans living in Tibet under a Chinese administration," he said.Authorities deporting Tsering had acted at the request of the Chinese Embassy in Nepal, which had put the name Penpa Tsering on a list of persons to be refused entry to the country, the Kathmandu-based Himalayan Times news agency said on June 24, citing unnamed Nepalese officials.But even after realizing their mistake, and after consulting with higher officials including Nepal's Home Minister, "we simply chose to be on the safe side by deporting [Tsering] to the US," one official was quoted as saying.Attempts by RFA to reach the U.S. Embassy in Nepal for comment were unsuccessful.'Seeking clarification'In an emailed statement to the Himalayan Times, however, embassy spokesperson Andie De Arment voiced concern over Tsering's treatment at the hands of Nepalese officials."We are seeking clarification from the Nepalese government about the facts of this specific instance and, more generally, on whether US citizens seeking to enter Nepal will be subject to clearance from other foreign governments," De Arment said, quoted by the Himalayan Times on June 27.Reached by RFA for comment on Friday, a State Department spokesperson described the United States as "troubled" that Nepal had deported a U.S. citizen."We have raised our concerns with the Nepal government about this specific case and are seeking clarification from the Nepal government about the facts of this specific instance," the State Department said.Nepal shares a long border with Tibet and is home to around 20,000 exiles who began arriving in 1959 when a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule forced Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama into exile in Dharamsala in India's Himalayan foothills.Nepal cites the One-China Policy and its strong ties with Beijing in cracking down on Tibetan community activities in the country, such as elections among the refugee community and birthday celebrations for the Dalai Lama.Nepal banned birthday celebrations again this year for the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, who turns 84 on July 6, the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office in Kathmandu announced on Friday."Tacit verbal approval" had at first been given by authorities for a celebration at a local Tibetan monastery, Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office representative Tsultrim Gyatso said."But on July 3, the Chief District Officer and the Nepali police issued an order banning this year's celebration.""Now they have to dismantle the tents and pack everything up," Gyatso said.Reported by Kalden Lodoe and Kunsang Tenzin for RFA's Tibetan Service.

During his first day on the job in China, the chancellor met with Vice President Wang Qishan, with whom he discussed the Mexican government's interest in developing a bilateral cooperation agenda.According to the Mexican chancellery, both representatives agreed to work to strengthen cooperation ties, taking as a point of reference the four conducts to eradicate from President Xi Jinping: frivolity, corruption, bureaucracy excessive and hedonism in public service.

The head of the Global Economic Intelligence Unit of the Ministry of the Economy, Sergio Silva Castañeda, explained the opportunities mexico offers for trade and investment between the two countries.The working visit will conclude on Tuesday with meetings between Ebrard and his counterpart, Wang Yi.Load-Date: July 2, 2019End of Document

Huawei's CEO claims HongMeng OS is faster than AndroidStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJuly 8, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 382 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyBut it looks like Ren Zhengfei, Huawei's founder and CEO, isn't banking on being welcomed back into the Android family.In a rare interview with a French magazine, Zhengfei says that its internally developed operating system, called HongMeng or Ark OS, is 60% faster than Android and more efficient that Apple's macOS.One thing's for sure, we'll nearly certainlysee more of HongMeng OS in the next month or two.Chinese giant Huawei has gone through a lot in just the last few months, with a USA imposed ban causing multiple tech giants from cutting ties with the company, telecom operators declining orders for Huawei phones, and entire nations considering banning Huawei outright from their 5G rollout plans - all of this, because the USA believes that Huawei is funded by the Chinese military and government and gives away consumer data to the Chinese government.Those have been the allegations hurled at Huawei even before Trump's administration but it seems that the United States government has no direct and irrefutable proof yet of the company's involvement in such activities. Zhengfei says he would rather die than sell out its customers because, in the end, he would be the one ending up with debt to pay.Realme A1 likely to launch soon, box image leakedThe Redmi 7A brings a general upgrade over the Redmi 6A-it is fueled by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 octa-core chipset timed at 2GHz. For connectivity, the devices will carry Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth v5.0, GPS/ A-GPS, NFC, USB Type-C, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.The US government has banned Huawei to operate in the country in the interest of national policy, claiming it is hand in glove with the Chinese government.Everyone staying updated with the latest Huawei news will know that the company is said to prepare a new operating system to replace Android."So they would resign [in case of violation of Huawei users' privacy] and start their own companies, leaving me alone to pay off our debts".Sandwiched between the ongoing US-China trade war, Huawei has now been allowed by President Donald Trump to purchase technology from American companies but the 5G ban is still in place. So, we need to wait for the company to announce the upcoming software, whcih is most likely to happen at the upcoming Huawei's Developer Conference.Load-Date: July 9, 2019End of Document

The rule takes effect one year before the mandatory August 2020 Congress deadline for all federal contractors doing business with Huawei, ZTE, Hytera and Hikvision.We recommend: Huawei will be able to sell in the United States in two weeksHowever, the U.S. government will grant exemptions to contractors as long as their work does not pose a threat to national security.So far Huawei and ZTE spokespersons have not issued any communications.Huawei has always claimed that it cannot spy for the Chinese government through its computers, but critics, including the government and many lawmakers, claim that the company's technology primarily network equipment such as 5G cellular stations, could put Data of Americans at risk of Chinese surveillance or espionage.You're interested: Why does Huawei have so many problems with the United States?       Load-Date: August 7, 2019End of Document

Contributing to today's slight decline are losses in Facebook (FB 197.27, -2.46, -1.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1901.35, -41.35, -2.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1233.09, -17.32, -1.4%).There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%).

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1963/922. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2099/928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

The Dow is up 0.3%.Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes, little to no profit. Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. UK's FTSE climbed 1.8%, as the British pound declined to its lowest level in over two years amid speculation of a no-deal Brexit. Germany's DAX finished flat, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.1%.11:25 ETDow +78.50 at 27270.95, Nasdaq -55.86 at 8274.35, S&P -4.73 at 3021.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%. Contributing to today's slight decline are losses in Facebook (FB 197.27, -2.46, -1.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1901.35, -41.35, -2.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1233.09, -17.32, -1.4%).There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%). Another laggard includes the energy sector (-0.5%) despite oil prices ($56.33, +0.14, +0.3%) ticking higher.10:55 ETDow +49.52 at 27241.97, Nasdaq -57.47 at 8272.74, S&P -6.06 at 3019.8[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2% in a mixed session.

On the other hand, the Fed will kick off its two-day policy meeting tomorrow, and expectations are high for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting.It isn't too surprising to see some hesitation this morning ahead of these potential market-moving events, especially after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit new all-time highs on Friday.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1963/922. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2099/928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

The Dow is up 0.3%.Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes little to no profit. Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed.

It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%). Another laggard includes the energy sector (-0.5%) despite oil prices ($56.33, +0.14, +0.3%) ticking higher.10:55 ETDow +49.52 at 27241.97, Nasdaq -57.47 at 8272.74, S&P -6.06 at 3019.8[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2% in a mixed session. The Dow, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Today's price action has shown little conviction in front of an eventful week that will include the FOMC rate decision, the July employment report, U.S.-China trade talks, and another round of earnings reports.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 12.98, +0.82, +6.7%) has increased today but not too noticeably.

The market is gearing up for several central bank policy meetings, including the Fed's on Tuesday and Wednesday.In addition, investors this week will be looking for any updates on U.S.-China trade talks and will be waiting for earnings reports and the release of key economic data like the July employment report.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -1.60.

Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1963/922. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2099/928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

MMM gains after news that the company had settled a paint spray technology patent dispute with Saint-Gobain Abrasives Inc.Conversely, healthcare product company Pfizer (PFE 42.21, -0.88, -2.04%) sits at the bottom of the index after the company announced a definitive agreement to combine its Upjohn business with Mylan (MYL 21.00, +2.54, +13.76%).The DJIA starts the week out on a high note, now up some 2.47% on the month.12:55 ETDow +42.88 at 27235.33, Nasdaq -50.63 at 8279.58, S&P -6.12 at 3019.74[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed today with the S&P 500 (-0.2%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.6%) both down following record-setting performances on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Broadly-speaking, there isn't too much conviction in the market today in front of an eventful week. Notable events, among many things, will include the FOMC's rate decision, the July employment report, and U.S.-China trade talks. While trade expectations are low, partly due to President Trump saying he doesn't expect a deal until after the 2020 presidential election, rate-cut expectations are high.In the meantime, widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1898.19, -44.85, -2.3%), Facebook (FB 196.16, -3.58, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1234.91, -15.50, -1.2%) are down noticeably and have contributed to the underperformance of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.9%) and communication services (-0.7%) sectors.There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding from crowded positions that were mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, or a form of profit taking after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following earnings on Friday.On the other hand, the S&P 500 real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors have provided some support for the broader market.In addition, shares of Apple (AAPL 210.06, +2.32, +1.1%) are up over 1% after UBS increased its price target to $235 from $225 ahead of its earnings report after Tuesday's close. Its outperformance has provided influential support for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.05, +2.58, +14.0%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 42.38, -0.71, -1.7%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates, while Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.Investors did not receive any notable economic data today.12:25 ETDow +41.54 at 27233.99, Nasdaq -58.40 at 8271.81, S&P -7.25 at 3018.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.2% and has wavered in negative territory all session.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 210.41, +2.67, +1.3%) as the lone stock trading higher after its price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS ahead of its earnings report.Amazon (AMZN 1893.55, -50.60, -2.6%) is down more than 2.5% followed by Facebook (FB 196.01, -3.74, -1.9%), Netflix (NFLX 331.38, -4.40, -1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1232.45, -17.96, -1.4%), which are also down noticieably. Fellow mega-cap stock Microsoft (MSFT 140.53, -0.81) is down 0.6%.12:00 ETDow +71.62 at 27264.07, Nasdaq -48.35 at 8281.86, S&P -3.73 at 3022.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade mixed, but the S&P 500 (-0.1%) and Nasdaq (-0.6%) are off their session lows. The Dow is up 0.3%.Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes little to no profit. Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. UK's FTSE climbed 1.8%, as the British pound declined to its lowest level in over two years amid speculation of a no-deal Brexit. Germany's DAX finished flat, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.1%.11:25 ETDow +78.50 at 27270.95, Nasdaq -55.86 at 8274.35, S&P -4.73 at 3021.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%. Contributing to today's slight decline are losses in Facebook (FB 197.27, -2.46, -1.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1901.35, -41.35, -2.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1233.09, -17.32, -1.4%).There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%). Another laggard includes the energy sector (-0.5%) despite oil prices ($56.33, +0.14, +0.3%) ticking higher.10:55 ETDow +49.52 at 27241.97, Nasdaq -57.47 at 8272.74, S&P -6.06 at 3019.8[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2% in a mixed session. The Dow, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Today's price action has shown little conviction in front of an eventful week that will include the FOMC rate decision, the July employment report, U.S.-China trade talks, and another round of earnings reports.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 12.98, +0.82, +6.7%) has increased today but not too noticeably. The VIX could be something to keep an eye on, especially with the aforementioned events coming up.10:30 ETDow +28.56 at 27221.01, Nasdaq -68.49 at 8261.72, S&P -7.58 at 3018.28[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are higher (+0.04% at 78.77 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.10)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now -$0.06 (-0.1%) at $56.17/barrelAug natural gas is -$0.04 (-2.2%) at $2.10/MMBtu.Moving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$0.40 at $1419.17/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.01 (+0.1%) at $16.41/ozSept copper is now +$0.02 (+0.7%) at $2.70/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1138/1568. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1076/1828.09:55 ETDow +16.02 at 27208.47, Nasdaq -51.66 at 8278.55, S&P -7.46 at 3018.4[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.2%.Shares of Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.02, +2.56) are up 14.1% after agreeing to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.96, -1.14, -2.6%) off-patent drug business. MYL shareholders will own 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates, while Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.Separately, Apple (209.29, +1.55) is up 0.8%, helping provide some support for the broader market. Apple will release its earnings report after Tuesday's close.09:40 ETDow +36.11 at 27228.56, Nasdaq -18.79 at 8311.42, S&P -2.00 at 3023.86[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day mixed. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows most sectors trading near their unchanged marks. Consumer discretionary (-0.5%) is underperforming in the early going, while real estate (+0.3%), utilities (+0.2%), and health care (+0.2%) outperform.U.S. Treasuries are up today, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield are down three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.05%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.09.

Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade two points, or 0.1%, below fair value.Aside from UK's FTSE rising 2.0% amid the British pound hitting its lowest level in more than two years, there hasn't been much market-moving news today. The market is gearing up for several central bank policy meetings, including the Fed's on Tuesday and Wednesday.In addition, investors this week will be looking for any updates on U.S.-China trade talks and will be waiting for earnings reports and the release of key economic data like the July employment report.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -1.60.

China's Securities Regulatory Commission suspended more than 40 IPOs due to a concern that the country's second largest auditor falsified information regarding these listings.

On the other hand, the Fed will kick off its two-day policy meeting tomorrow, and expectations are high for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting.It isn't too surprising to see some hesitation this morning ahead of these potential market-moving events, especially after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit new all-time highs on Friday. Also, while there will be no notable economic data released today, there are some health care corporate news for investors to parse through.Dow component Pfizer (PFE 42.45, -0.64, -1.5%) missed revenue estimates and lowered its full-year guidance to reflect anticipated completions of prior acquisitions.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1963/922. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2099/928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

The Nasdaq Composite still posts the worst losses, down 0.57%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosts the only gains, up 0.19%, with the S&P 500 landing in the middle, down 0.17%.Gold futures settled less than 0.1% higher on Monday at $1,420.40/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index, too, moves less than 0.1% higher on Monday at 98.07.13:30 ETDow +66.00 at 27258.45, Nasdaq -45.11 at 8285.1, S&P -4.32 at 3021.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have held their lines in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still in the lead, up 0.24%.Action in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is modestly higher with names like 3M (MMM 176.97, +2.99, +1.72%), Intel (INTC 52.42, +0.83, +1.61%), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 132.74, +2.01, +1.54%) providing upside. MMM gains after news that the company had settled a paint spray technology patent dispute with Saint-Gobain Abrasives Inc.Conversely, healthcare product company Pfizer (PFE 42.21, -0.88, -2.04%) sits at the bottom of the index after the company announced a definitive agreement to combine its Upjohn business with Mylan (MYL 21.00, +2.54, +13.76%).The DJIA starts the week out on a high note, now up some 2.47% on the month.12:55 ETDow +42.88 at 27235.33, Nasdaq -50.63 at 8279.58, S&P -6.12 at 3019.74[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed today with the S&P 500 (-0.2%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.6%) both down following record-setting performances on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Broadly-speaking, there isn't too much conviction in the market today in front of an eventful week. Notable events, among many things, will include the FOMC's rate decision, the July employment report, and U.S.-China trade talks. While trade expectations are low, partly due to President Trump saying he doesn't expect a deal until after the 2020 presidential election, rate-cut expectations are high.In the meantime, widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1898.19, -44.85, -2.3%), Facebook (FB 196.16, -3.58, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1234.91, -15.50, -1.2%) are down noticeably and have contributed to the underperformance of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.9%) and communication services (-0.7%) sectors.There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding from crowded positions that were mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, or a form of profit taking after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following earnings on Friday.On the other hand, the S&P 500 real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors have provided some support for the broader market.In addition, shares of Apple (AAPL 210.06, +2.32, +1.1%) are up over 1% after UBS increased its price target to $235 from $225 ahead of its earnings report after Tuesday's close. Its outperformance has provided influential support for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.05, +2.58, +14.0%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 42.38, -0.71, -1.7%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates, while Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.Investors did not receive any notable economic data today.12:25 ETDow +41.54 at 27233.99, Nasdaq -58.40 at 8271.81, S&P -7.25 at 3018.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.2% and has wavered in negative territory all session.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 210.41, +2.67, +1.3%) as the lone stock trading higher after its price target was raised to $235 from $225 at UBS ahead of its earnings report.Amazon (AMZN 1893.55, -50.60, -2.6%) is down more than 2.5% followed by Facebook (FB 196.01, -3.74, -1.9%), Netflix (NFLX 331.38, -4.40, -1.3%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1232.45, -17.96, -1.4%), which are also down noticieably. Fellow mega-cap stock Microsoft (MSFT 140.53, -0.81) is down 0.6%.12:00 ETDow +71.62 at 27264.07, Nasdaq -48.35 at 8281.86, S&P -3.73 at 3022.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade mixed, but the S&P 500 (-0.1%) and Nasdaq (-0.6%) are off their session lows. The Dow is up 0.3%.Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes little to no profit. Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. UK's FTSE climbed 1.8%, as the British pound declined to its lowest level in over two years amid speculation of a no-deal Brexit. Germany's DAX finished flat, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.1%.11:25 ETDow +78.50 at 27270.95, Nasdaq -55.86 at 8274.35, S&P -4.73 at 3021.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%. Contributing to today's slight decline are losses in Facebook (FB 197.27, -2.46, -1.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1901.35, -41.35, -2.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1233.09, -17.32, -1.4%).There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%). Another laggard includes the energy sector (-0.5%) despite oil prices ($56.33, +0.14, +0.3%) ticking higher.10:55 ETDow +49.52 at 27241.97, Nasdaq -57.47 at 8272.74, S&P -6.06 at 3019.8[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2% in a mixed session. The Dow, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Today's price action has shown little conviction in front of an eventful week that will include the FOMC rate decision, the July employment report, U.S.-China trade talks, and another round of earnings reports.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 12.98, +0.82, +6.7%) has increased today but not too noticeably. The VIX could be something to keep an eye on, especially with the aforementioned events coming up.10:30 ETDow +28.56 at 27221.01, Nasdaq -68.49 at 8261.72, S&P -7.58 at 3018.28[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are higher (+0.04% at 78.77 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.10)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now -$0.06 (-0.1%) at $56.17/barrelAug natural gas is -$0.04 (-2.2%) at $2.10/MMBtu.Moving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$0.40 at $1419.17/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.01 (+0.1%) at $16.41/ozSept copper is now +$0.02 (+0.7%) at $2.70/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1138/1568. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1076/1828.09:55 ETDow +16.02 at 27208.47, Nasdaq -51.66 at 8278.55, S&P -7.46 at 3018.4[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.2%.Shares of Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.02, +2.56) are up 14.1% after agreeing to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 41.96, -1.14, -2.6%) off-patent drug business. MYL shareholders will own 43% of the combined company. On a related note, Mylan N.V. beat top and bottom-line estimates, while Pfizer beat earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates.Separately, Apple (209.29, +1.55) is up 0.8%, helping provide some support for the broader market.

The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows most sectors trading near their unchanged marks. Consumer discretionary (-0.5%) is underperforming in the early going, while real estate (+0.3%), utilities (+0.2%), and health care (+0.2%) outperform.U.S. Treasuries are up today, pushing yields lower across the curve.

Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade two points, or 0.1%, below fair value.Aside from UK's FTSE rising 2.0% amid the British pound hitting its lowest level in more than two years, there hasn't been much market-moving news today. The market is gearing up for several central bank policy meetings, including the Fed's on Tuesday and Wednesday.In addition, investors this week will be looking for any updates on U.S.-China trade talks and will be waiting for earnings reports and the release of key economic data like the July employment report.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -1.60.

Another bank bailout took place in China, as three major banks acquired a nearly 20.0% stake in Bank of Jinzhou. This comes after the Chinese government seized Baoshang Bank in June. China's Securities Regulatory Commission suspended more than 40 IPOs due to a concern that the country's second largest auditor falsified information regarding these listings. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said it is unlikely that he will meet with South Korea's President Moon Jae-in at the UN meeting in September unless South Korea takes "constructive steps" to improve relations between the two countries.In economic data: Japan's June Retail Sales +0.5% yr/yr (expected 0.2%; last 1.3%) Australia's Q2 HIA New Home Sales -12.4% yr/yr (last 28.8%)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: -0.4% Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -1.0% China's Shanghai Composite: -0.1% India's Sensex: -0.5% South Korea's Kospi: -1.8% Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5%Major European indices trade near their flat lines while the U.K.'s FTSE (+1.9%) outperforms, rising to a fresh high for the year as the pound hits its lowest level in more than two years.

On the other hand, the Fed will kick off its two-day policy meeting tomorrow, and expectations are high for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting.It isn't too surprising to see some hesitation this morning ahead of these potential market-moving events, especially after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit new all-time highs on Friday. Also, while there will be no notable economic data released today, there are some health care corporate news for investors to parse through.Dow component Pfizer (PFE 42.45, -0.64, -1.5%) missed revenue estimates and lowered its full-year guidance to reflect anticipated completions of prior acquisitions.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1963/922. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2099/928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

Namely, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 806.72, +26.86, +3.44%), Fiserv (FISV 171.02, +3.72, +2.22%), and CIGNA (CI 104.54, +2.24, +2.19%) all host gains north of 2%. CMG is strong on Monday in reaction to Goldman's initiation and $1000 price target, FISV moves higher after completing its combination with First Data, and CI is higher in sympathy to general gains in managed care names.Conversely, San Francisco-based biotech firm Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 29.44, -1.68, -5.40%). Recall that last week NKTR received a letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the company's mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate, NKTR-181.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Broadly-speaking, there isn't too much conviction in the market today in front of an eventful week. Notable events, among many things, will include the FOMC's rate decision, the July employment report, and U.S.-China trade talks. While trade expectations are low, partly due to President Trump saying he doesn't expect a deal until after the 2020 presidential election, rate-cut expectations are high.In the meantime, widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1898.19, -44.85, -2.3%), Facebook (FB 196.16, -3.58, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1234.91, -15.50, -1.2%) are down noticeably and have contributed to the underperformance of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.9%) and communication services (-0.7%) sectors.There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding from crowded positions that were mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, or a form of profit taking after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following earnings on Friday.On the other hand, the S&P 500 real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors have provided some support for the broader market.In addition, shares of Apple (AAPL 210.06, +2.32, +1.1%) are up over 1% after UBS increased its price target to $235 from $225 ahead of its earnings report after Tuesday's close. Its outperformance has provided influential support for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.05, +2.58, +14.0%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 42.38, -0.71, -1.7%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company.

The Dow is up 0.3%.Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes little to no profit. Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. UK's FTSE climbed 1.8%, as the British pound declined to its lowest level in over two years amid speculation of a no-deal Brexit. Germany's DAX finished flat, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.1%.11:25 ETDow +78.50 at 27270.95, Nasdaq -55.86 at 8274.35, S&P -4.73 at 3021.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%. Contributing to today's slight decline are losses in Facebook (FB 197.27, -2.46, -1.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1901.35, -41.35, -2.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1233.09, -17.32, -1.4%).There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%). Another laggard includes the energy sector (-0.5%) despite oil prices ($56.33, +0.14, +0.3%) ticking higher.10:55 ETDow +49.52 at 27241.97, Nasdaq -57.47 at 8272.74, S&P -6.06 at 3019.8[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2% in a mixed session. The Dow, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Today's price action has shown little conviction in front of an eventful week that will include the FOMC rate decision, the July employment report, U.S.-China trade talks, and another round of earnings reports.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 12.98, +0.82, +6.7%) has increased today but not too noticeably.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1963/922. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2099/928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Broadly-speaking, there isn't too much conviction in the market today in front of an eventful week. Notable events, among many things, will include the FOMC's rate decision, the July employment report, and U.S.-China trade talks. While trade expectations are low, partly due to President Trump saying he doesn't expect a deal until after the 2020 presidential election, rate-cut expectations are high.In the meantime, widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1898.19, -44.85, -2.3%), Facebook (FB 196.16, -3.58, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1234.91, -15.50, -1.2%) are down noticeably and have contributed to the underperformance of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.9%) and communication services (-0.7%) sectors.There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding from crowded positions that were mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, or a form of profit taking after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following earnings on Friday.On the other hand, the S&P 500 real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors have provided some support for the broader market.In addition, shares of Apple (AAPL 210.06, +2.32, +1.1%) are up over 1% after UBS increased its price target to $235 from $225 ahead of its earnings report after Tuesday's close. Its outperformance has provided influential support for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.05, +2.58, +14.0%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 42.38, -0.71, -1.7%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company.

The Dow is up 0.3%.Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes little to no profit. Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. UK's FTSE climbed 1.8%, as the British pound declined to its lowest level in over two years amid speculation of a no-deal Brexit. Germany's DAX finished flat, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.1%.11:25 ETDow +78.50 at 27270.95, Nasdaq -55.86 at 8274.35, S&P -4.73 at 3021.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%. Contributing to today's slight decline are losses in Facebook (FB 197.27, -2.46, -1.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1901.35, -41.35, -2.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1233.09, -17.32, -1.4%).There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%). Another laggard includes the energy sector (-0.5%) despite oil prices ($56.33, +0.14, +0.3%) ticking higher.10:55 ETDow +49.52 at 27241.97, Nasdaq -57.47 at 8272.74, S&P -6.06 at 3019.8[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2% in a mixed session. The Dow, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Today's price action has shown little conviction in front of an eventful week that will include the FOMC rate decision, the July employment report, U.S.-China trade talks, and another round of earnings reports.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 12.98, +0.82, +6.7%) has increased today but not too noticeably.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1963/922. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2099/928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

CMG is strong on Monday in reaction to Goldman's initiation and $1000 price target, FISV moves higher after completing its combination with First Data, and CI is higher in sympathy to general gains in managed care names.Conversely, San Francisco-based biotech firm Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 29.44, -1.68, -5.40%). Recall that last week NKTR received a letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the company's mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate, NKTR-181.

The Nasdaq Composite still posts the worst losses, down 0.57%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosts the only gains, up 0.19%, with the S&P 500 landing in the middle, down 0.17%.Gold futures settled less than 0.1% higher on Monday at $1,420.40/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index, too, moves less than 0.1% higher on Monday at 98.07.13:30 ETDow +66.00 at 27258.45, Nasdaq -45.11 at 8285.1, S&P -4.32 at 3021.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have held their lines in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still in the lead, up 0.24%.Action in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is modestly higher with names like 3M (MMM 176.97, +2.99, +1.72%), Intel (INTC 52.42, +0.83, +1.61%), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 132.74, +2.01, +1.54%) providing upside. MMM gains after news that the company had settled a paint spray technology patent dispute with Saint-Gobain Abrasives Inc.Conversely, healthcare product company Pfizer (PFE 42.21, -0.88, -2.04%) sits at the bottom of the index after the company announced a definitive agreement to combine its Upjohn business with Mylan (MYL 21.00, +2.54, +13.76%).The DJIA starts the week out on a high note, now up some 2.47% on the month.12:55 ETDow +42.88 at 27235.33, Nasdaq -50.63 at 8279.58, S&P -6.12 at 3019.74[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed today with the S&P 500 (-0.2%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.6%) both down following record-setting performances on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Broadly-speaking, there isn't too much conviction in the market today in front of an eventful week. Notable events, among many things, will include the FOMC's rate decision, the July employment report, and U.S.-China trade talks. While trade expectations are low, partly due to President Trump saying he doesn't expect a deal until after the 2020 presidential election, rate-cut expectations are high.In the meantime, widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1898.19, -44.85, -2.3%), Facebook (FB 196.16, -3.58, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1234.91, -15.50, -1.2%) are down noticeably and have contributed to the underperformance of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.9%) and communication services (-0.7%) sectors.There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding from crowded positions that were mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, or a form of profit taking after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following earnings on Friday.On the other hand, the S&P 500 real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors have provided some support for the broader market.In addition, shares of Apple (AAPL 210.06, +2.32, +1.1%) are up over 1% after UBS increased its price target to $235 from $225 ahead of its earnings report after Tuesday's close. Its outperformance has provided influential support for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.05, +2.58, +14.0%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 42.38, -0.71, -1.7%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company.

Fellow mega-cap stock Microsoft (MSFT 140.53, -0.81) is down 0.6%.12:00 ETDow +71.62 at 27264.07, Nasdaq -48.35 at 8281.86, S&P -3.73 at 3022.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade mixed, but the S&P 500 (-0.1%) and Nasdaq (-0.6%) are off their session lows. The Dow is up 0.3%.Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes little to no profit. Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. UK's FTSE climbed 1.8%, as the British pound declined to its lowest level in over two years amid speculation of a no-deal Brexit. Germany's DAX finished flat, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.1%.11:25 ETDow +78.50 at 27270.95, Nasdaq -55.86 at 8274.35, S&P -4.73 at 3021.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%. Contributing to today's slight decline are losses in Facebook (FB 197.27, -2.46, -1.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1901.35, -41.35, -2.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1233.09, -17.32, -1.4%).There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%). Another laggard includes the energy sector (-0.5%) despite oil prices ($56.33, +0.14, +0.3%) ticking higher.10:55 ETDow +49.52 at 27241.97, Nasdaq -57.47 at 8272.74, S&P -6.06 at 3019.8[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2% in a mixed session. The Dow, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Today's price action has shown little conviction in front of an eventful week that will include the FOMC rate decision, the July employment report, U.S.-China trade talks, and another round of earnings reports.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 12.98, +0.82, +6.7%) has increased today but not too noticeably. The VIX could be something to keep an eye on, especially with the aforementioned events coming up.10:30 ETDow +28.56 at 27221.01, Nasdaq -68.49 at 8261.72, S&P -7.58 at 3018.28[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are higher (+0.04% at 78.77 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.10)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now -$0.06 (-0.1%) at $56.17/barrelAug natural gas is -$0.04 (-2.2%) at $2.10/MMBtu.Moving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$0.40 at $1419.17/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.01 (+0.1%) at $16.41/ozSept copper is now +$0.02 (+0.7%) at $2.70/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1138/1568. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1076/1828.09:55 ETDow +16.02 at 27208.47, Nasdaq -51.66 at 8278.55, S&P -7.46 at 3018.4[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.2%.Shares of Mylan N.V.

On the other hand, the Fed will kick off its two-day policy meeting tomorrow, and expectations are high for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting.It isn't too surprising to see some hesitation this morning ahead of these potential market-moving events, especially after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit new all-time highs on Friday.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1963/922. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2099/928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

Currently, the benchmark index holds a slight loss of 0.2%.Price action has been muted, as investors appear willing to wait for the upcoming trading catalysts this week. Perhaps the most widely expected event, which also happens to be the one with the most widely-expected outcome, is the FOMC's rate decision on Wednesday.The market is expecting at least a 25-basis points rate cut. Fed officials have been concerned about low inflation levels that could be ingrained in the economy should consumers and businesses begin to expect low inflation.14:55 ETDow +40.65 at 27233.1, Nasdaq -37.67 at 8292.54, S&P -4.57 at 3021.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.7%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.4%) has been resilient today, recovering from a lower start to add to its 4.6% gain from last week. Investors haven't been too discouraged by growing expectations that a trade deal with China could still be at least one year away, as suggested by President Trump.Looking ahead, notable companies that will report earnings before tomorrow's open include Beyond Meat (BYND 220.65, -14.11, -5.9%), Procter & Gamble (PG 115.74, +1.01, +0.9%), and Merck (MRK 82.41, +1.00, +1.2%).14:30 ETDow +39.10 at 27231.55, Nasdaq -42.20 at 8288.01, S&P -5.03 at 3020.83[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has trimmed its percentage losses to 0.17% vs 0.38% at today's lows.The S&P 500, although modestly lower, houses some names in the market that show relative strength on Monday. Namely, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 806.72, +26.86, +3.44%), Fiserv (FISV 171.02, +3.72, +2.22%), and CIGNA (CI 104.54, +2.24, +2.19%) all host gains north of 2%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Broadly-speaking, there isn't too much conviction in the market today in front of an eventful week. Notable events, among many things, will include the FOMC's rate decision, the July employment report, and U.S.-China trade talks. While trade expectations are low, partly due to President Trump saying he doesn't expect a deal until after the 2020 presidential election, rate-cut expectations are high.In the meantime, widely-held shares of Amazon (AMZN 1898.19, -44.85, -2.3%), Facebook (FB 196.16, -3.58, -1.9%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1234.91, -15.50, -1.2%) are down noticeably and have contributed to the underperformance of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.9%) and communication services (-0.7%) sectors.There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding from crowded positions that were mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, or a form of profit taking after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following earnings on Friday.On the other hand, the S&P 500 real estate (+0.5%), health care (+0.4%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors have provided some support for the broader market.In addition, shares of Apple (AAPL 210.06, +2.32, +1.1%) are up over 1% after UBS increased its price target to $235 from $225 ahead of its earnings report after Tuesday's close. Its outperformance has provided influential support for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow.Separately, Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.05, +2.58, +14.0%) agreed to combine with Pfizer's (PFE 42.38, -0.71, -1.7%) off-patent drug business, giving Mylan shareholders 43% of the combined company.

The Dow is up 0.3%.Software stocks are underperforming today following cautious commentary in a Barron's article. The report cited some analysts describing the sector as having indications of a bubble due to its extremely high valuations and oftentimes little to no profit. Twilio (TWLO 141.06, -8.90), which is one of this year's best-performing "small-cap" software stocks, is down 6.0% today.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. UK's FTSE climbed 1.8%, as the British pound declined to its lowest level in over two years amid speculation of a no-deal Brexit. Germany's DAX finished flat, and France's CAC declined 0.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.1%.11:25 ETDow +78.50 at 27270.95, Nasdaq -55.86 at 8274.35, S&P -4.73 at 3021.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2%. Contributing to today's slight decline are losses in Facebook (FB 197.27, -2.46, -1.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1901.35, -41.35, -2.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1233.09, -17.32, -1.4%).There are no specific news drivers to account for their underperformance today. It could be some unwinding of crowded positions, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report, or a form of profit taking, especially after Alphabet shares surged more than 10% following its earnings report on Friday.In turn, today's worst-performing sectors are the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.8%) and communication services (-0.6%). Another laggard includes the energy sector (-0.5%) despite oil prices ($56.33, +0.14, +0.3%) ticking higher.10:55 ETDow +49.52 at 27241.97, Nasdaq -57.47 at 8272.74, S&P -6.06 at 3019.8[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.2% in a mixed session. The Dow, which underperformed last week, is up 0.2%.Today's price action has shown little conviction in front of an eventful week that will include the FOMC rate decision, the July employment report, U.S.-China trade talks, and another round of earnings reports.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 12.98, +0.82, +6.7%) has increased today but not too noticeably.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1963/922. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2099/928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 25 of 714Media Analyses: Restart Of US-China Talks, Ease Of Huawei Ban Boosts US Stocks  Page 28 of 714Trump attacks on Google recycle baseless claims  Page 31 of 714Trump attacks on Google recycle baseless claims  Page  of China donates office equipment to Cambodia's Preah Sihanouk Provincial Hall  Page 45 of 714Sinovac Reports Unaudited Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results  Page 48 of 714Oranco, Inc.
