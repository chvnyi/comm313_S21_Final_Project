China criticizes US tech curbs but trade talks going aheadAssociated Press InternationalOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 11:00 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 535 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China demanded Washington lift newly imposed sanctions on Chinese tech companies but said Tuesday envoys will go ahead with a U.S. trip for trade talks despite the latest spike in tensions.The foreign ministry criticized the curbs on sales of U.S. technology to the Chinese companies as interference in China's affairs but gave no indication whether Beijing might retaliate. The measure announced Monday targets providers of technology Washington says is being used to repress Muslim ethnic minorities."We urge the United States to immediately correct its wrong practices, withdraw the relevant decisions and stop interfering in China's internal affairs," said the spokesman, Geng Shuang. "China will continue to take firm and strong measures to resolutely safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests."The curbs are an added strain for U.S.-Chinese relations and have stoked alarm about the possible impact on the global economy at a time when growth is weakening.They target Chinese companies that develop facial recognition and other artificial intelligence technology U.S. officials say is being used to repress Muslims in China's northwest.Vendors are barred from selling U.S. technology to the Chinese companies without government permission. They include Hikvision and Dahua, both of which are global providers of video surveillance technology.Prominent AI firms such as Sense Time, Megvii and iFlytek are also on the Commerce Department's Entity List. Sense Time and Megvii are known for computer vision technology that underpins facial recognition products, while iFlytek is known for its voice recognition and translation services.Megvii said Tuesday there are "no grounds" for including the company in the blacklist. Megvii said it received no revenue from projects in Xinjiang in the six months through June 30."We believe our inclusion on the list reflects a misunderstanding of our company," said a Megvii statement.Hikvision said Monday it respects human rights and opposes the Trump administration's decision.Similar sanctions were imposed earlier on Huawei Technologies Ltd., a maker of smartphones and network switching equipment that is China's first global tech brand.Despite the Chinese criticism, the Ministry of Commerce said Vice Premier Liu He will go to Washington for talks Thursday. His delegation will include China's commerce minister and central bank governor and industry, technology and agriculture regulators.The two governments have made conciliatory gestures ahead of the talks including lifting or postponing punitive tariffs. But there has been no sign of progress toward settling their core disputes over China's trade surplus and technology ambitions.Beijing is resisting U.S. pressure to roll back plans for government-led development of global competitors in robotics and other technologies.Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate China's market-opening commitments. Some American officials worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.The two sides have raised import duties on billions of dollars of each other's goods, fueling fears their dispute might tip the global economy into recession.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

Opinion: The chilling effect of China's business relations with Blizzard EntertainmentThe Columbian: Columbia CollegeOctober 22, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: COMMENTARY; Pg. 1Length: 611 wordsByline: Isaiah ColbertBodyAP Photo/Vincent YuProfessional "Hearthstone" esports player Ng "Blitzchung" Wai Chung voiced his support for Hong Kong protesters in a post-game interview following his recent Grandmasters competition. Lifting a gas mask, similar to those of Taiwanese protesters, Chung said,"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age."Two days later, on Oct. 8, Blizzard Entertainment, the company behind "Hearthstone," an online collectible card game, suspended Chung for a year, had his prize money taken away and announced they would cease working with the broadcasters who interviewed him."Every Voice Matters, and we strongly encourage everyone in our community to share their viewpoints in the many places available to express themselves," Blizzard Entertainment President J. Allen Brack said in a statement following the tournament. "However, the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament and to be a place where all are welcome. In support of that, we want to keep the official channels focused on the game. ... The specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: Our relationships in China had no influence on our decision."The company has since backpedaled on its initial punishment for Chung and the broadcasters, with Brack stating the company's response was not adequate and that they "reacted too quickly." As of now, Chung and the broadcasters will only face six-month suspensions, and Chung will receive his winnings.Blizzard's actions are hypocritical to their core values. "Think Globally; Lead Responsibly; and importantly, Every Voice Matters, encouraging everybody to share their point of view," Blizzard said in a statement. Blizzard is saying they value the viewpoints of individuals but those viewpoints can't be expressed. This is a confusing double-speak. Blizzard also suspended three American University esport players for six months as well, for simply holding signs in support of Hong Kong during the "Hearthstone" championship match Oct. 15. This act only further makes one question what Blizzard truly values.The company's acknowledgement that their haste in punishing Chung is all well and good, but their timing seems more calculated than accidental. Because of this, any sentiment that Blizzard was trying to give to their community ironically got lost.Social media responses to Blizzard's handling of the situation has led to the hashtag #BoycottBlizzard. Things intensified and many company members staged a walk-out on Oct. 8. Hong Kong protesters who are gamers have also turned Mei, a Chinese character from "Overwatch," Blizzard's first-person shooter game, into a pro-Hong Kong symbol. Blizzard has since canceled an event for the release of "Overwatch" on the Nintendo Switch console in New York City on Oct. 16, possibly so they would not have to deal with protesters at the event.American companies altering their products and services and using their power in an attempt to silence or censor people to please the Chinese government is not that surprising.China is an important market for Blizzard, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for 12% of Blizzard's revenue last quarter and the Chinese entertainment company Tencent owning 5% of Blizzard's parent company.Blizzard saying their relationship with China doesn't affect their decisions is hard to believe, as they would run the risk of losing their expanding market and alienating their share owners if they didn't make a statement penalizing Chung.Blizzard wants to be seen as an inclusive and diverse company. But if the company were truly that, there wouldn't be the chilling silence of human rights expression.Load-Date: October 22, 2019End of Document

Launch of the 2nd call of solicitation on best poverty reduction practicesPR NewswireOctober 17, 2019 Thursday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4262 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Oct. 17, 2019 BodyPR NewswireA video presented by China.org.cn on launch of the 2nd call of solicitation on the best poverty reduction practices: Intro: At the 2019 China Poverty Reduction International Forum on Wednesday, China Internet Information Center and six other organizations announced the launch of the second call of the Global Solicitation on Best Poverty Reduction Practices.At the 2019 China Poverty Reduction International Forum on Wednesday, China Internet Information Center and six other organizations announced the launch of the second call of the Global Solicitation on Best Poverty Reduction Practices.Running from October 16, 2019, to March 31, 2020, the new campaign will invite organizations and individuals from all over the world to submit examples of poverty reduction cases. It aims to share domestic and international best practices in poverty alleviation using real-life cases as the mechanism, so as to promote South-South Cooperation in poverty alleviation.The campaign is jointly hosted by the World Bank (WB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), International Poverty Reduction Center in China (IPRCC), China Internet Information Center (CIIC), and the three Rome-based Agencies of the United Nations (RBAs)-the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and World Food Programme (WFP).It is planned to publish a compilation of the top 100 case studies in 2020, and this will be shared and promoted around the world through the Global Poverty Reduction Online Knowledge Sharing Database. Individual authors and organizations with winning submissions will each receive a certificate issued by the hosting organizations.At the forum, the list of the 110 best poverty reduction case studies selected from a total of 820 case studies submitted in the first round of the campaign, launched in May last year, was also announced. 645 case studies were submitted by Government agencies at all levels, enterprises and individuals in China, presenting various approaches to poverty reduction. These include poverty reduction through tourism, financial poverty alleviation, poverty reduction for vulnerable groups, and poverty reduction through employment and entrepreneurship. 175 international cases were contributed by international organizations and research institutions including the WFP, IFAD, FAO, WB, ADB, African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET), and Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative(OPHI) at the University of Oxford. These case studies cover more than 30 countries, including Pakistan, Brazil, Philippines, Colombia, Cambodia, Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, Laos, and Malaysia.At the 3rd annual International Seminar on Global Poverty Reduction Partnerships in Rome last May, Xia Gengsheng, vice minister of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Reduction and Development, said that the Chinese government was working on its post-2020 strategy for poverty reduction. "We will promote cooperation with international agencies so that we can better explore measures to address relative poverty and promote poverty alleviation in China in a sustainable manner."The 2019 China Poverty Reduction International Forum was hosted through the combined efforts of the seven above-mentioned organizations, under the theme of "Joint efforts on knowledge sharing, to promote global poverty reduction governance."More than 200 guests from 30 countries attended the forum.Annex: List of the 110 best case studies from the first "Global Solicitation and Challenge Prize on Best Poverty Reduction Practices"Award List of the Global Solicitation and Challenge Prize on Best Poverty Reduction Practices (This list is in no particular order)CaseOrganizationIndustries with Local Characteristics Help Alleviate Poverty and Increase Income -

All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 16726 wordsBodyHourly In Play (R)Updated: 17-Oct-19 12:00 ET11:54AXP American Express Earnings Preview- Investors look for strong consumer to offset commercial weakness (118.13 +0.72)American Express (AXP) is set to report Q3 results tomorrow before the market opens with a conference call to follow at 8:30am ET.Current Capital IQ stands at EPS of $2.02 on Revenue of $10.9 bln.9/23- Increased dividend to $0.43 from $0.39 and announced a new 120 mln share repurchase.FY19 EPS Outlook in the $7.85-8.35 range. At the Barclays conference on September 10, AXP laid out the reasoning behind its wider than usual range for EPS guidance. That was due to the uncertainty in the economic environment. Comments at Barclays suggested AXP would see the middle of that range. So analysts are expecting company to tighten the outlook. The midpoint will be key with current Capital IQ consensus sitting at $8.10. The primary weakness for AXP is around its commercial end which makes up 42% of the business. The consumer remains strong.FY19 Revenue Growth in the range of 8-10%. AXP has reaffirmed this number the past two quarters despite only posting growth of 6.6% in Q1 and 8.4% in Q2. This has investors looking at the company either posting a back end loaded revenue number, which may be difficult given the slow down in commercial, or for AXP to lower the high end of this estimate.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jun) earnings of $2.07 per share, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.02. Revenues rose 8.4% year/year to $10.84 bln vs the $10.82 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Consolidated provisions for losses were $861 million, up 7 percent from $806 million a year ago. The increase reflected higher net lending write-offs driven by loan growth. Consolidated expenses were $7.8 billion, up 9 percent from $7.1 billion a year ago. The rise reflected, in part, growth in rewards and other customer engagement costs driven by increased Card Member spending, higher usage of card benefits and continued investments in cobrand partnerships. Operating expenses were up 7 percent from a year ago.Co reaffirmed guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $7.85-8.35 vs. $8.09 S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Reaffirmed FY19 revs of +8-10% yr/yr to ~$43.6-44.4 bln vs. $43.57 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.ValuationsAXP- Forward P/E 13.1x; Price to Book 4.24x; Dividend Yield 1.46%; YTD Stock +23%.COF- Forward P/E 7.6x; Price to Book 0.82x; Dividend Yield 1.78%; YTD Stock +19%.DFS- Forward P/E 8.2x; Price to Book 2.31x; Dividend Yield 2.24%; YTD Stock +33%.V- Forward P/E 28.4x; Price to Book 13.2x; Dividend Yield 0.56%; YTD Stock +35%.MA- Forward P/E 30.9x; Price to Book 56.67x; Dividend Yield 0.47%; YTD Stock +48%.11:29TALKX Market Briefing: Modest gains as buyer confidence kept in checkThe major indices are sporting modest gains, boosted by strength in the health care (+0.9%) and industrials (+0.8%) sectors. The laggard of note is the information technology sector (-0.3%), which is being weighed down by the response to IBM's (IBM 134.26, -7.85, -5.5%) relatively disappointing earnings report.The health care sector is benefiting from news of a potential opioid settlement being in the works, which is leading to outsized gains for drug distributor stocks like McKesson (MCK 150.20, +5.36, +3.7%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.15, +2.08, +4.2%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.36, +3.31, +3.9%). The industrials sector is benefiting from positive responses to the earnings reports out of Honeywell (HON 168.00, +4.37, +2.7%), Dover (DOV 101.10, +5.28, +5.5%), United Rentals (URI 128.96, +7.29, +6.0%), CSX Corp. (CSX 70.58, +1.58, +2.3%) and Union Pacific (UNP 164.61, +1.30, +0.8%).Separately, the market has gotten a bit of a boost from reports that a Brexit compromise has been reached between the UK and EU; however, complete enthusiasm has been held in check by commensurate reports highlighting opposition from some parties that could negate this "deal."Speaking of deals, the "phase one" deal between the U.S. and China is still raising questions for market participants that is acting as a restraint on buyer confidence. According to a South China Morning Post report today, China is open to a partial deal, but says trade tensions will only end when all tariffs are lifted.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are up 0.3%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:19BRBR BellRing Brands opened for trading at $15.60 after pricing IPO at $1411:09MRTX Mirati Therapeutics +5% after confirming MRTX849 data presentations (84.07 +3.71)Mirati Therapeutics announced this morning that it will present pre-clinical data and initial clinical data for MRTX849, its novel and otpimized KRAS G12C inhibitor, in presentations at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, which will be held in Boston on October 26-30. Among these presentations, pre-clinical MRTX849 data will be showcased in an oral presentation, "The KRAS G12C Inhibitor, MRTX849, Provides Insight Toward Therapeutic Susceptibility of KRAS Mutant Cancers," in the afternoon on October 28, beginning at 4:20 p.m. EDT.The stock spiked by as much as 9% following the announcement.11:04IYT Better than feared results from rail carriers boost transport stocks (188.59 +1.21)Transport stocks have shown relative strength in the early going, helping the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.6%) extend this week's gain to 2.0%.Today's advance is receiving broad-based support, as all 20 components trade with gains while four group members are up more than 1.0%. Rail carriers CSX (CSX 70.54, +1.54, +2.2%) and Union-Pacific (UNP 164.68, +1.37, +0.8%) trade solidly higher after both companies reported their Q3 results. CSX exceeded earnings and revenue expectations while Union-Pacific missed. However, both companies showed an improvement in efficiency, which is being rewarded by the market.Another DJTA component-Kansas City Southern (KSU 134.79, +0.50, +0.4%)-will report its Q3 results ahead of tomorrow's open.Today's rally has lifted the DJTA to its best level in nearly a month, but the economically sensitive group remains inside a sideways range that has been in place for almost two years. The top of that range, which is about 10% above the current price level, was marked last September while the bottom, 18% below the current level, was notched in December 2018.11:01ECONX Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the week ending October 11, 2019U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15.4 million barrels per day during the week ending October 11, 2019, which was 221,000 barrels per day less than the previous week's average.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed.

Dr. Lee and colleagues concluded that the savolitinib monotherapy trial also met the pre-specified 6-week progression free survival rate, indicating that it is worthy of further exploration in the MET amplification subset of patients with gastric cancer.06:12STLD Steel Dynamics reports EPS in-line, misses on revs (28.84 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.69 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.69; revenues fell 21.6% year/year to $2.53 bln vs the $2.67 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Outlook "Based on domestic steel demand fundamentals, we are constructive regarding 2020 North American steel market dynamics. We believe North American steel consumption will experience modest growth and will be supported by further steel import reductions and the end of steel inventory destocking.

S&P Futures are back above that critical 3000 level and currently trading around the 3004 area. This is just off the session high of 3006.50 and left the overnight low sitting at 2985.25.In Asia, both the Nikkei and Shanghai closed fractionally lower on the day. The Shanghai opened higher but could not manage to maintain gains despite reports that the Chinese government is mulling loosening restrictions for foreign investors. The Nikkei was led lower by tech stocks. Tokyo Electron fell 9% after chip peer ASML saw weakness following earnings on Wednesday. In Europe, the major bourses are witnessing a mixed tape with the FTSE outpacing the region. The status of Brexit talks remains the key focus. The British pound has seen a volatile session and is up nearly 1%. This has not weighed on the FTSE, however. Outside of the UK, the markets have seen more of a cautious environment.

Guidance for 2019 remains unchanged. Recent test results from Kisladag confirm that recoveries from leaching deeper material over 250-day cycles support an extension of mine life beyond the company's current three-year guidance. Waste stripping to support a mine life extension will commence prior to the end of October. Test work is still ongoing to determine the ultimate heap leach recovery of this material and thus the ultimate length of the mine life extension. Waste stripping over the remainder of 2019 is expected to minimize production interruptions in 2020 and beyond. Estimated expenditure for waste stripping in 2019 is $4 mln. Production at Olympias was lower than plan. During the third quarter, measures to increase production volumes were continued in key areas of the operation and will support the ramp up towards 2020 and beyond. These measures included increased capital development resources and other operational improvement initiatives.17:37WTFC Wintrust Fin beats by $0.07, beats on revs (64.50 -0.29)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.69 per share, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.62; revenues rose 9.4% year/year to $380 mln vs the $374.98 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.17:36CCK Crown reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; guides Q4 EPS below consensus (63.53 +0.67)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.56 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.56; revenues fell 2.8% year/year to $3.08 bln vs the $3.19 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020.

At the Barclays conference on September 10, AXP laid out the reasoning behind its wider than usual range for EPS guidance. That was due to the uncertainty in the economic environment. Comments at Barclays suggested AXP would see the middle of that range. So analysts are expecting company to tighten the outlook. The midpoint will be key with current Capital IQ consensus sitting at $8.10. The primary weakness for AXP is around its commercial end which makes up 42% of the business. The consumer remains strong.FY19 Revenue Growth in the range of 8-10%. AXP has reaffirmed this number the past two quarters despite only posting growth of 6.6% in Q1 and 8.4% in Q2. This has investors looking at the company either posting a back end loaded revenue number, which may be difficult given the slow down in commercial, or for AXP to lower the high end of this estimate.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jun) earnings of $2.07 per share, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.02. Revenues rose 8.4% year/year to $10.84 bln vs the $10.82 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Consolidated provisions for losses were $861 million, up 7 percent from $806 million a year ago. The increase reflected higher net lending write-offs driven by loan growth. Consolidated expenses were $7.8 billion, up 9 percent from $7.1 billion a year ago. The rise reflected, in part, growth in rewards and other customer engagement costs driven by increased Card Member spending, higher usage of card benefits and continued investments in cobrand partnerships. Operating expenses were up 7 percent from a year ago.Co reaffirmed guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $7.85-8.35 vs. $8.09 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The laggard of note is the information technology sector (-0.3%), which is being weighed down by the response to IBM's (IBM 134.26, -7.85, -5.5%) relatively disappointing earnings report.The health care sector is benefiting from news of a potential opioid settlement being in the works, which is leading to outsized gains for drug distributor stocks like McKesson (MCK 150.20, +5.36, +3.7%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.15, +2.08, +4.2%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.36, +3.31, +3.9%).

(CSX 70.58, +1.58, +2.3%) and Union Pacific (UNP 164.61, +1.30, +0.8%).Separately, the market has gotten a bit of a boost from reports that a Brexit compromise has been reached between the UK and EU; however, complete enthusiasm has been held in check by commensurate reports highlighting opposition from some parties that could negate this "deal."Speaking of deals, the "phase one" deal between the U.S. and China is still raising questions for market participants that is acting as a restraint on buyer confidence. According to a South China Morning Post report today, China is open to a partial deal, but says trade tensions will only end when all tariffs are lifted.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are up 0.3%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:19BRBR BellRing Brands opened for trading at $15.60 after pricing IPO at $1411:09MRTX Mirati Therapeutics +5% after confirming MRTX849 data presentations (84.07 +3.71)Mirati Therapeutics announced this morning that it will present pre-clinical data and initial clinical data for MRTX849, its novel and otpimized KRAS G12C inhibitor, in presentations at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, which will be held in Boston on October 26-30.

Rail carriers CSX (CSX 70.54, +1.54, +2.2%) and Union-Pacific (UNP 164.68, +1.37, +0.8%) trade solidly higher after both companies reported their Q3 results. CSX exceeded earnings and revenue expectations while Union-Pacific missed. However, both companies showed an improvement in efficiency, which is being rewarded by the market.Another DJTA component-Kansas City Southern (KSU 134.79, +0.50, +0.4%)-will report its Q3 results ahead of tomorrow's open.Today's rally has lifted the DJTA to its best level in nearly a month, but the economically sensitive group remains inside a sideways range that has been in place for almost two years.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed. It hasn't had a more pronounced impact, though, for several reasons:The U.S. market has never been fully bothered by the idea of a disorderly Brexit, content it seems to see it as more of an issue for the UK and the EU.There is ample doubt still that it will win approval in Parliament.The relatively subdued response in the UK's FTSE 100 (+0.5%) and in the British pound (+0.2% against the dollar) suggests there is reason to keep enthusiasm in check at the moment.08:04BYSI BeyondSpring: US Patent Office has granted the Company a new patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,357,491 B2, for methods of treating a brain tumor by administering Plinabulin (18.30 )The patent, which expires in 2036, covers methods for Plinabulin's use in the treatment of brain tumors, including metastatic brain tumor, with no approved chemotherapy on the market, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common adult brain tumor.

This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

Weakness in IBM (IBM 133.35, -8.76, -6.2%) after a revenue miss is weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch) and S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.4%).The broader market remains slightly higher, though, thanks to relative strength in the S&P 500 health care (+0.9%), real estate (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.7%) sectors. Positive reactions to earnings reports from Honeywell (HON 167.99, +4.34, +2.7%), CSX (CSX 70.21, +1.22, +1.8%), and Union Pacific (UNP 165.48, +2.17, +1.3%) are supporting the industrials sector.As for health care, the group appears to be benefiting from a view that opioid litigation could be settled for a total package of $50 billion, according to Reuters. Companies involved in the offer include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 137.13, +1.96, +1.5%), Teva Pharma (TEVA 7.43, +0.48, +7.0%), McKesson (MCK 150.58, +5.76, +3.9%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.01, +1.94, +4.0%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.12, +3.08, +3.6%).Some cautious views on Brexit and a U.S.-China trade deal, meanwhile, may be restraining some buying conviction. A draft Brexit deal was announced, but some parties have already expressed their disapproval in front of a key vote this weekend. Separately, a report out of China reminded investors that Beijing wants all tariffs removed in order to end trade tensions.Isolated earnings reactions belong to Netflix (NFLX 298.10, +11.82, +4.1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS 43.83, +1.03, +2.4%).

Germany lowering its 2020 growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.5% may have increased demand. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down two basis points to 1.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 97.58.Reviewing today's economic data:Total housing starts declined a disappointing 9.4% m/m in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.306 million). Building permits declined 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.387 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.350 million).The key takeaway from the Housing Starts and Building Permits report is that the month-over-month weakness was a function of downturns for multi-unit dwellings. Single-family starts were up 0.3% to 918,000 while single-family permits were up 0.8% to 882,000.Initial claims for the week ending October 12 increased by 4,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 5 decreased by 10,000 to 1.679 million.The key takeaway from the initial claims report is that it bodes well for another solid increase in October nonfarm payrolls, as this report covers the period in which the survey for the October employment report was conducted.Industrial production declined 0.4% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus -0.3%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 0.6%) in August. Total capacity utilization dropped to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.7%) from 77.9% in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the weakness was unduly influenced by the strike at General Motors (GM), which contributed to a 0.7% decline in the manufacturing output for durables.The Philadelphia Fed Index for October checked in at 5.6 (Briefing.com consensus 6.0) versus 12.0 in September.12:44SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: CRON (35.22 mln +2.44%), TEVA (28.24 mln +7.63%), ENDP (20.57 mln +16.35%), ACB (12.95 mln +5.12%)Materials: X (21.54 mln +0.47%)Industrials: GE (16.07 mln +1.69%)Consumer Discretionary: F (14.83 mln +0.06%), NIO (12.97 mln -0.34%), ROKU (12.14 mln +4.06%)Information Technology: NOK (24.93 mln +1.28%), AMD (24.19 mln +0.52%), INFY (23.96 mln -0.47%), ERIC (14.06 mln +4.59%), MSFT (11.01 mln -0.68%)Financials: BAC (32.3 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (32.87 mln -1.53%), MDR (11.41 mln +6.6%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: ASMB (9.46x +39.91%), CRON (8.51x +2.44%), NTRA (3.21x +3.9%), RCUS (2.2x +4.56%), ENDP (2.1x +16.35%), KNSA (2.05x -4.92%)Materials: CCK (2.97x +6.86%), LOMA (2.11x +5.57%)Industrials: URI (2.56x +0.85%), GTLS (1.94x +1.56%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (5.1x -46.13%)Information Technology: WNS (3.89x +6.4%), IBM (3.26x -6.32%), PAGS (3.23x +0.76%), ERIC (2.5x +4.59%)Consumer Staples: UN (3.19x +1.39%)12:43SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ASMB (17.79 +39.91%), ENDP (4.84 +16.35%), CLVS (3.61 +12.66%), MNK (2.48 +10.71%), TEVA (7.48 +7.63%), DPLO (5.16 +7.28%)Materials: CCK (67.89 +6.86%), HL (1.99 +6.72%), NGD (0.98 +6.62%), AA (20.35 +6.21%)Consumer Discretionary: TTM (9.78 +9.34%), POOL (216.91 +8.06%)Information Technology: FIT (3.98 +6.51%), WNS (64.38 +6.4%)Energy: REI (1.8 +9.09%), MDR (2.51 +6.6%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: AKCA (18.07 -7.66%), INO (2.34 -6.61%), ABEO (2.3 -5.54%), KNSA (5.32 -4.92%)Industrials: TXT (47.85 -5.19%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (0.6 -46.13%), IGT (13.6 -5.29%), BZUN (42.26 -5.24%), FNKO (18.13 -3.95%)Information Technology: IBM (133.13 -6.32%)Financials: MTB (151.24 -4.84%), EWBC (41.57 -4.66%), UMPQ (15.35 -3.88%)Energy: XOG (2.27 -9.56%), SPN (0.42 -9.21%), NBR (1.72 -6.01%), ESV (5.34 -4.86%), GTE (1.07 -4.05%)Consumer Staples: NBEV (2.86 -7%)12:27RHHBY Roche Hldg receives FDA approval for Xofluza sNDA for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza (36.42 +0.68)12:18SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Syros Pharmaceuticals (SYRS) sinks after discontinuing SY-1365 development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersASMB (17.4 +36.85%): The stock, currently trading with circa 10x average volume, sees a notable extension of yesterday's strength; it advanced on Wednesday after announcing that data for its lead HBV core inhibitor candidates, ABI-H0731 and ABI-H2158, for the treatment of chronic HBV will be featured in a late-breaking poster session during the AASLD Annual Meeting in November.

Co notes that SY-5609 demonstrated greater anti-tumor activity than did SY-1365 in multiple preclinical models and that SY-1365 "did not support an optimal profile for patients" in initial data from the expansion of the Phase 1 trial of SY-1365. Co identifies SY-5609 as the more selective and more potent CDK7 inhibitor and believes that it has "best-in-class potential." At three-month lows.XOG (2.28 -9.36%): Downgraded to Underperform from Outperform and price target cut to $2 from $7 at Imperial Capital, citing expectations for flat Q3 production levels, owing to unplanned outages in co's Western Gas system and startup delays for the Rimrock system, and noting fundamental riskiness in co's business model relative to DJ Basin peers, among other factors.

At the Barclays conference on September 10, AXP laid out the reasoning behind its wider than usual range for EPS guidance. That was due to the uncertainty in the economic environment. Comments at Barclays suggested AXP would see the middle of that range. So analysts are expecting company to tighten the outlook. The midpoint will be key with current Capital IQ consensus sitting at $8.10. The primary weakness for AXP is around its commercial end which makes up 42% of the business. The consumer remains strong.FY19 Revenue Growth in the range of 8-10%. AXP has reaffirmed this number the past two quarters despite only posting growth of 6.6% in Q1 and 8.4% in Q2. This has investors looking at the company either posting a back end loaded revenue number, which may be difficult given the slow down in commercial, or for AXP to lower the high end of this estimate.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jun) earnings of $2.07 per share, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.02. Revenues rose 8.4% year/year to $10.84 bln vs the $10.82 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Consolidated provisions for losses were $861 million, up 7 percent from $806 million a year ago. The increase reflected higher net lending write-offs driven by loan growth. Consolidated expenses were $7.8 billion, up 9 percent from $7.1 billion a year ago. The rise reflected, in part, growth in rewards and other customer engagement costs driven by increased Card Member spending, higher usage of card benefits and continued investments in cobrand partnerships. Operating expenses were up 7 percent from a year ago.Co reaffirmed guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $7.85-8.35 vs. $8.09 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The laggard of note is the information technology sector (-0.3%), which is being weighed down by the response to IBM's (IBM 134.26, -7.85, -5.5%) relatively disappointing earnings report.The health care sector is benefiting from news of a potential opioid settlement being in the works, which is leading to outsized gains for drug distributor stocks like McKesson (MCK 150.20, +5.36, +3.7%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.15, +2.08, +4.2%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.36, +3.31, +3.9%). The industrials sector is benefiting from positive responses to the earnings reports out of Honeywell (HON 168.00, +4.37, +2.7%), Dover (DOV 101.10, +5.28, +5.5%), United Rentals (URI 128.96, +7.29, +6.0%), CSX Corp. (CSX 70.58, +1.58, +2.3%) and Union Pacific (UNP 164.61, +1.30, +0.8%).Separately, the market has gotten a bit of a boost from reports that a Brexit compromise has been reached between the UK and EU; however, complete enthusiasm has been held in check by commensurate reports highlighting opposition from some parties that could negate this "deal."Speaking of deals, the "phase one" deal between the U.S. and China is still raising questions for market participants that is acting as a restraint on buyer confidence. According to a South China Morning Post report today, China is open to a partial deal, but says trade tensions will only end when all tariffs are lifted.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are up 0.3%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:19BRBR BellRing Brands opened for trading at $15.60 after pricing IPO at $1411:09MRTX Mirati Therapeutics +5% after confirming MRTX849 data presentations (84.07 +3.71)Mirati Therapeutics announced this morning that it will present pre-clinical data and initial clinical data for MRTX849, its novel and otpimized KRAS G12C inhibitor, in presentations at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, which will be held in Boston on October 26-30. Among these presentations, pre-clinical MRTX849 data will be showcased in an oral presentation, "The KRAS G12C Inhibitor, MRTX849, Provides Insight Toward Therapeutic Susceptibility of KRAS Mutant Cancers," in the afternoon on October 28, beginning at 4:20 p.m. EDT.The stock spiked by as much as 9% following the announcement.11:04IYT Better than feared results from rail carriers boost transport stocks (188.59 +1.21)Transport stocks have shown relative strength in the early going, helping the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.6%) extend this week's gain to 2.0%.Today's advance is receiving broad-based support, as all 20 components trade with gains while four group members are up more than 1.0%. Rail carriers CSX (CSX 70.54, +1.54, +2.2%) and Union-Pacific (UNP 164.68, +1.37, +0.8%) trade solidly higher after both companies reported their Q3 results. CSX exceeded earnings and revenue expectations while Union-Pacific missed. However, both companies showed an improvement in efficiency, which is being rewarded by the market.Another DJTA component-Kansas City Southern (KSU 134.79, +0.50, +0.4%)-will report its Q3 results ahead of tomorrow's open.Today's rally has lifted the DJTA to its best level in nearly a month, but the economically sensitive group remains inside a sideways range that has been in place for almost two years. The top of that range, which is about 10% above the current price level, was marked last September while the bottom, 18% below the current level, was notched in December 2018.11:01ECONX Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the week ending October 11, 2019U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15.4 million barrels per day during the week ending October 11, 2019, which was 221,000 barrels per day less than the previous week's average.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed.

This is just off the session high of 3006.50 and left the overnight low sitting at 2985.25.In Asia, both the Nikkei and Shanghai closed fractionally lower on the day. The Shanghai opened higher but could not manage to maintain gains despite reports that the Chinese government is mulling loosening restrictions for foreign investors. The Nikkei was led lower by tech stocks. Tokyo Electron fell 9% after chip peer ASML saw weakness following earnings on Wednesday. In Europe, the major bourses are witnessing a mixed tape with the FTSE outpacing the region. The status of Brexit talks remains the key focus. The British pound has seen a volatile session and is up nearly 1%. This has not weighed on the FTSE, however. Outside of the UK, the markets have seen more of a cautious environment. Automakers are notably stronger, with Daimler and BMW both showing gains of greater than 0.5%.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +14.010 yr Note: 1.79%USD/JPY: 108.90 +0.13EUR/USD: 1.1117 +0.0045Europe: FTSE +0.6% DAX +0.3% CAC -0.1%Asia: Hang Seng +0.7% Shanghai -0.1% Nikkei -0.1%Gold (1488.90 -5.10) Silver (17.44 +0.01) Crude (53.18 -0.18)17:49EGO Eldorado Gold reports preliminary Q3 results; production guidance for 2019 remains unchanged (7.39 +0.16)Total gold production was 101,596 ounces for the third quarter and 276,376 ounces year-to-date. Guidance for 2019 remains unchanged. Recent test results from Kisladag confirm that recoveries from leaching deeper material over 250-day cycles support an extension of mine life beyond the company's current three-year guidance. Waste stripping to support a mine life extension will commence prior to the end of October. Test work is still ongoing to determine the ultimate heap leach recovery of this material and thus the ultimate length of the mine life extension. Waste stripping over the remainder of 2019 is expected to minimize production interruptions in 2020 and beyond. Estimated expenditure for waste stripping in 2019 is $4 mln. Production at Olympias was lower than plan. During the third quarter, measures to increase production volumes were continued in key areas of the operation and will support the ramp up towards 2020 and beyond. These measures included increased capital development resources and other operational improvement initiatives.17:37WTFC Wintrust Fin beats by $0.07, beats on revs (64.50 -0.29)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.69 per share, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.62; revenues rose 9.4% year/year to $380 mln vs the $374.98 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.17:36CCK Crown reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; guides Q4 EPS below consensus (63.53 +0.67)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.56 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.56; revenues fell 2.8% year/year to $3.08 bln vs the $3.19 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

Also, in light of its strong year-to-date financial performance, HMH revised its full year 2019 billings guidance range, which was previously $1,530 million to $1,610 million, to $1,590 million to $1,620 million with content development spend expected to be between $100 to $110 million and total capital expenditures to be between $150 and $160 million. The co also announced actions that are creating new product development and go-to-market capabilities, as well as the streamlining of operations company-wide for greater efficiency. These actions are expected to result in the elimination of 8% of HMH's workforce, after taking into account new strategy-aligned positions that are expected to be added and additional operating and capitalized cost reductions, including a redesigned product development model that is expected to result in approximately 20% less content development expenditures than previously planned over the next three years starting in 2020.13:02FIT Fitbit jumps 6% after announcing collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance (3.98 +0.24)The Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance and Fitbit today announced at the TIME 100 Health Summit in New York that they are working together to help drive timely diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with the aim of improving earlier detection in individuals at increased risk of stroke.

Upon submission and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the AFib detection software on Fitbit devices, the parties will aim to provide users with appropriate information to help encourage and inform discussions with their physicians.12:59WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks up but off session highs; S&P 500 near 3000 levelA strong start for the major averages has lost some steam, leaving the S&P 500 (+0.3%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) with modest gains. Weakness in IBM (IBM 133.35, -8.76, -6.2%) after a revenue miss is weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch) and S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.4%).The broader market remains slightly higher, though, thanks to relative strength in the S&P 500 health care (+0.9%), real estate (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.7%) sectors. Positive reactions to earnings reports from Honeywell (HON 167.99, +4.34, +2.7%), CSX (CSX 70.21, +1.22, +1.8%), and Union Pacific (UNP 165.48, +2.17, +1.3%) are supporting the industrials sector.As for health care, the group appears to be benefiting from a view that opioid litigation could be settled for a total package of $50 billion, according to Reuters. Companies involved in the offer include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 137.13, +1.96, +1.5%), Teva Pharma (TEVA 7.43, +0.48, +7.0%), McKesson (MCK 150.58, +5.76, +3.9%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.01, +1.94, +4.0%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.12, +3.08, +3.6%).Some cautious views on Brexit and a U.S.-China trade deal, meanwhile, may be restraining some buying conviction. A draft Brexit deal was announced, but some parties have already expressed their disapproval in front of a key vote this weekend. Separately, a report out of China reminded investors that Beijing wants all tariffs removed in order to end trade tensions.Isolated earnings reactions belong to Netflix (NFLX 298.10, +11.82, +4.1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS 43.83, +1.03, +2.4%). Netflix provided results that are being construed as better than feared, while Morgan Stanley beat top and bottom-line estimates.U.S. Treasuries have been on a steady rebound from overnight lows, leaving yields slightly lower. Germany lowering its 2020 growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.5% may have increased demand. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down two basis points to 1.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 97.58.Reviewing today's economic data:Total housing starts declined a disappointing 9.4% m/m in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.306 million). Building permits declined 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.387 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.350 million).The key takeaway from the Housing Starts and Building Permits report is that the month-over-month weakness was a function of downturns for multi-unit dwellings. Single-family starts were up 0.3% to 918,000 while single-family permits were up 0.8% to 882,000.Initial claims for the week ending October 12 increased by 4,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 5 decreased by 10,000 to 1.679 million.The key takeaway from the initial claims report is that it bodes well for another solid increase in October nonfarm payrolls, as this report covers the period in which the survey for the October employment report was conducted.Industrial production declined 0.4% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus -0.3%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 0.6%) in August. Total capacity utilization dropped to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.7%) from 77.9% in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the weakness was unduly influenced by the strike at General Motors (GM), which contributed to a 0.7% decline in the manufacturing output for durables.The Philadelphia Fed Index for October checked in at 5.6 (Briefing.com consensus 6.0) versus 12.0 in September.12:44SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: CRON (35.22 mln +2.44%), TEVA (28.24 mln +7.63%), ENDP (20.57 mln +16.35%), ACB (12.95 mln +5.12%)Materials: X (21.54 mln +0.47%)Industrials: GE (16.07 mln +1.69%)Consumer Discretionary: F (14.83 mln +0.06%), NIO (12.97 mln -0.34%), ROKU (12.14 mln +4.06%)Information Technology: NOK (24.93 mln +1.28%), AMD (24.19 mln +0.52%), INFY (23.96 mln -0.47%), ERIC (14.06 mln +4.59%), MSFT (11.01 mln -0.68%)Financials: BAC (32.3 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (32.87 mln -1.53%), MDR (11.41 mln +6.6%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: ASMB (9.46x +39.91%), CRON (8.51x +2.44%), NTRA (3.21x +3.9%), RCUS (2.2x +4.56%), ENDP (2.1x +16.35%), KNSA (2.05x -4.92%)Materials: CCK (2.97x +6.86%), LOMA (2.11x +5.57%)Industrials: URI (2.56x +0.85%), GTLS (1.94x +1.56%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (5.1x -46.13%)Information Technology: WNS (3.89x +6.4%), IBM (3.26x -6.32%), PAGS (3.23x +0.76%), ERIC (2.5x +4.59%)Consumer Staples: UN (3.19x +1.39%)12:43SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ASMB (17.79 +39.91%), ENDP (4.84 +16.35%), CLVS (3.61 +12.66%), MNK (2.48 +10.71%), TEVA (7.48 +7.63%), DPLO (5.16 +7.28%)Materials: CCK (67.89 +6.86%), HL (1.99 +6.72%), NGD (0.98 +6.62%), AA (20.35 +6.21%)Consumer Discretionary: TTM (9.78 +9.34%), POOL (216.91 +8.06%)Information Technology: FIT (3.98 +6.51%), WNS (64.38 +6.4%)Energy: REI (1.8 +9.09%), MDR (2.51 +6.6%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: AKCA (18.07 -7.66%), INO (2.34 -6.61%), ABEO (2.3 -5.54%), KNSA (5.32 -4.92%)Industrials: TXT (47.85 -5.19%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (0.6 -46.13%), IGT (13.6 -5.29%), BZUN (42.26 -5.24%), FNKO (18.13 -3.95%)Information Technology: IBM (133.13 -6.32%)Financials: MTB (151.24 -4.84%), EWBC (41.57 -4.66%), UMPQ (15.35 -3.88%)Energy: XOG (2.27 -9.56%), SPN (0.42 -9.21%), NBR (1.72 -6.01%), ESV (5.34 -4.86%), GTE (1.07 -4.05%)Consumer Staples: NBEV (2.86 -7%)12:27RHHBY Roche Hldg receives FDA approval for Xofluza sNDA for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza (36.42 +0.68)12:18SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Syros Pharmaceuticals (SYRS) sinks after discontinuing SY-1365 development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersASMB (17.4 +36.85%): The stock, currently trading with circa 10x average volume, sees a notable extension of yesterday's strength; it advanced on Wednesday after announcing that data for its lead HBV core inhibitor candidates, ABI-H0731 and ABI-H2158, for the treatment of chronic HBV will be featured in a late-breaking poster session during the AASLD Annual Meeting in November. At six-month highs.LLNW (3.88 +24.2%): Reported in-line Q3 EPS on upside revs (+4.1% yr/yr to $51.32 mln, or +12% sequentially) and reaffirmed its FY19 EPS and revs guidance. Co noted that it set a new record for traffic during the quarter, exceeding the previous record by approx. +20%. It credits accelerated investments in infrastructure, significant growth in capacity, and fiscal discipline for the quarter's results and notes that it expects Q4 to see yr/yr acceleration in revenue growth as well as improvements in gross margin and overall profitability. At 11-month highs. ENDP (4.93 +18.39%): Continued strength for co and various other drug manufacturers amid reported opioid settlement talks. At four-month highs.Small Cap LosersSYRS (6.85 -32.18%): Announced that it will discontinue further development of SY-1365, its intravenous CDK7 inhibitor, as it turns to prioritizing the development of oral CDK7 inhibitor SY-5609, for which it expects to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with select solid tumors in the first quarter of 2020. Co notes that SY-5609 demonstrated greater anti-tumor activity than did SY-1365 in multiple preclinical models and that SY-1365 "did not support an optimal profile for patients" in initial data from the expansion of the Phase 1 trial of SY-1365. Co identifies SY-5609 as the more selective and more potent CDK7 inhibitor and believes that it has "best-in-class potential." At three-month lows.XOG (2.28 -9.36%): Downgraded to Underperform from Outperform and price target cut to $2 from $7 at Imperial Capital, citing expectations for flat Q3 production levels, owing to unplanned outages in co's Western Gas system and startup delays for the Rimrock system, and noting fundamental riskiness in co's business model relative to DJ Basin peers, among other factors. At new all-time lows. ZIOP (3.84 -4.36%): Sees continued weakness; the stock slid lower yesterday afternoon following a cautious mention at Alpha Exposure. The stock today trades at its new lowest levels since March.12:04SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (104) outpacing new lows (21) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAN, ACM, AIV, AMAT, AMKR, ATKR, AVB, AYR, BHE, BLD, BLDR, BMCH, BRX, BZH, CCK, CCMP, CCS, CELG, CETV, CHCT, CHTR, CNS, COLD, CPB, CROX, CSTM, DCOM, DEA, DHI, DLR, DLTR, DOV, ENTG, EPRT, ETR, FBHS, FCN, FORM, FSP, GLIBA, GNRC, GWR, HCP, HD, HTA, HTLD, IBP, INFO, INVH, INXN, IRT, KBH, KLAC, KMX, KN, KOD, KRNT, KSU, LBRDK, LEN, LGIH, LTC, LULU, MAA, MAS, MCK, MDC, MDCO, MHO, MTH, MTZ, NFBK, NKE, NSA, O, ODFL, OHI, PFSI, PHM, PLD, PLMR, PLUG, POOL, RETA, REXR, RH, RLI, ROST, SHW, SJW, SNX, TGT, THG, TJX, TMHC, TPH, TRNO, UDR, VFC, WGO, WLH, WMS, WTR, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: CAAP, CBS, CJ, CRC, CRWD, ENLC, FIXX, FTSI, GTLS, GTYH, HEP, LGF.A, MTDR, PBT, PK, SCPL, SLCA, SM, TEUM, VIAB, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: BRT, IRET, NVMIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: FULC, KLDO, MIRM, RMNIETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWN, EWT, IOO, ITB, PSK, RTH, XHBETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX11:54AXP American Express Earnings Preview- Investors look for strong consumer to offset commercial weakness (118.13 +0.72)American Express (AXP) is set to report Q3 results tomorrow before the market opens with a conference call to follow at 8:30am ET.Current Capital IQ stands at EPS of $2.02 on Revenue of $10.9 bln.9/23- Increased dividend to $0.43 from $0.39 and announced a new 120 mln share repurchase.FY19 EPS Outlook in the $7.85-8.35 range. At the Barclays conference on September 10, AXP laid out the reasoning behind its wider than usual range for EPS guidance. That was due to the uncertainty in the economic environment. Comments at Barclays suggested AXP would see the middle of that range. So analysts are expecting company to tighten the outlook. The midpoint will be key with current Capital IQ consensus sitting at $8.10. The primary weakness for AXP is around its commercial end which makes up 42% of the business. The consumer remains strong.FY19 Revenue Growth in the range of 8-10%. AXP has reaffirmed this number the past two quarters despite only posting growth of 6.6% in Q1 and 8.4% in Q2. This has investors looking at the company either posting a back end loaded revenue number, which may be difficult given the slow down in commercial, or for AXP to lower the high end of this estimate.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jun) earnings of $2.07 per share, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.02. Revenues rose 8.4% year/year to $10.84 bln vs the $10.82 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Consolidated provisions for losses were $861 million, up 7 percent from $806 million a year ago. The increase reflected higher net lending write-offs driven by loan growth. Consolidated expenses were $7.8 billion, up 9 percent from $7.1 billion a year ago. The rise reflected, in part, growth in rewards and other customer engagement costs driven by increased Card Member spending, higher usage of card benefits and continued investments in cobrand partnerships. Operating expenses were up 7 percent from a year ago.Co reaffirmed guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $7.85-8.35 vs. $8.09 S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Reaffirmed FY19 revs of +8-10% yr/yr to ~$43.6-44.4 bln vs. $43.57 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.ValuationsAXP- Forward P/E 13.1x; Price to Book 4.24x; Dividend Yield 1.46%; YTD Stock +23%.COF- Forward P/E 7.6x; Price to Book 0.82x; Dividend Yield 1.78%; YTD Stock +19%.DFS- Forward P/E 8.2x; Price to Book 2.31x; Dividend Yield 2.24%; YTD Stock +33%.V- Forward P/E 28.4x; Price to Book 13.2x; Dividend Yield 0.56%; YTD Stock +35%.MA- Forward P/E 30.9x; Price to Book 56.67x; Dividend Yield 0.47%; YTD Stock +48%.11:29TALKX Market Briefing: Modest gains as buyer confidence kept in checkThe major indices are sporting modest gains, boosted by strength in the health care (+0.9%) and industrials (+0.8%) sectors. The laggard of note is the information technology sector (-0.3%), which is being weighed down by the response to IBM's (IBM 134.26, -7.85, -5.5%) relatively disappointing earnings report.The health care sector is benefiting from news of a potential opioid settlement being in the works, which is leading to outsized gains for drug distributor stocks like McKesson (MCK 150.20, +5.36, +3.7%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.15, +2.08, +4.2%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.36, +3.31, +3.9%). The industrials sector is benefiting from positive responses to the earnings reports out of Honeywell (HON 168.00, +4.37, +2.7%), Dover (DOV 101.10, +5.28, +5.5%), United Rentals (URI 128.96, +7.29, +6.0%), CSX Corp. (CSX 70.58, +1.58, +2.3%) and Union Pacific (UNP 164.61, +1.30, +0.8%).Separately, the market has gotten a bit of a boost from reports that a Brexit compromise has been reached between the UK and EU; however, complete enthusiasm has been held in check by commensurate reports highlighting opposition from some parties that could negate this "deal."Speaking of deals, the "phase one" deal between the U.S. and China is still raising questions for market participants that is acting as a restraint on buyer confidence. According to a South China Morning Post report today, China is open to a partial deal, but says trade tensions will only end when all tariffs are lifted.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are up 0.3%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:19BRBR BellRing Brands opened for trading at $15.60 after pricing IPO at $1411:09MRTX Mirati Therapeutics +5% after confirming MRTX849 data presentations (84.07 +3.71)Mirati Therapeutics announced this morning that it will present pre-clinical data and initial clinical data for MRTX849, its novel and otpimized KRAS G12C inhibitor, in presentations at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, which will be held in Boston on October 26-30. Among these presentations, pre-clinical MRTX849 data will be showcased in an oral presentation, "The KRAS G12C Inhibitor, MRTX849, Provides Insight Toward Therapeutic Susceptibility of KRAS Mutant Cancers," in the afternoon on October 28, beginning at 4:20 p.m. EDT.The stock spiked by as much as 9% following the announcement.11:04IYT Better than feared results from rail carriers boost transport stocks (188.59 +1.21)Transport stocks have shown relative strength in the early going, helping the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.6%) extend this week's gain to 2.0%.Today's advance is receiving broad-based support, as all 20 components trade with gains while four group members are up more than 1.0%. Rail carriers CSX (CSX 70.54, +1.54, +2.2%) and Union-Pacific (UNP 164.68, +1.37, +0.8%) trade solidly higher after both companies reported their Q3 results. CSX exceeded earnings and revenue expectations while Union-Pacific missed. However, both companies showed an improvement in efficiency, which is being rewarded by the market.Another DJTA component-Kansas City Southern (KSU 134.79, +0.50, +0.4%)-will report its Q3 results ahead of tomorrow's open.Today's rally has lifted the DJTA to its best level in nearly a month, but the economically sensitive group remains inside a sideways range that has been in place for almost two years. The top of that range, which is about 10% above the current price level, was marked last September while the bottom, 18% below the current level, was notched in December 2018.11:01ECONX Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the week ending October 11, 2019U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15.4 million barrels per day during the week ending October 11, 2019, which was 221,000 barrels per day less than the previous week's average.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM.

The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter. Crude oil production is expected to account for approx. 66% of the company's production during the quarter, while natural gas and NGLs are expected to account for approx. 18% and 16%, respectively. During September, Carrizo took advantage of the rally in commodity prices to add to its 2020 hedge position.16:10TBK Triumph Bancorp reports EPS in-line, net interest income increased 2% (31.29 +0.14)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.56 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.56.Net interest income for the quarter was $64.8 mln compared to $63.4 mln for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.

Adjusted EBITDA is currently estimated to be approximately 3 percent below budget, primarily due to the delay in Elba's in-service date, lower commodity prices and volumes impacting the CO2 segment, and the impact of 501-G settlements, partially offset by the strong performance of the West Region Natural Gas16:06CGNX Cognex acquires industrial machine vision software developer SUALAB (48.88 -0.26)SUALAB is a Korean-based developer of vision software using deep learning for industrial applications.

The co also announced actions that are creating new product development and go-to-market capabilities, as well as the streamlining of operations company-wide for greater efficiency. These actions are expected to result in the elimination of 8% of HMH's workforce, after taking into account new strategy-aligned positions that are expected to be added and additional operating and capitalized cost reductions, including a redesigned product development model that is expected to result in approximately 20% less content development expenditures than previously planned over the next three years starting in 2020.13:02FIT Fitbit jumps 6% after announcing collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance (3.98 +0.24)The Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance and Fitbit today announced at the TIME 100 Health Summit in New York that they are working together to help drive timely diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with the aim of improving earlier detection in individuals at increased risk of stroke.

Upon submission and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the AFib detection software on Fitbit devices, the parties will aim to provide users with appropriate information to help encourage and inform discussions with their physicians.12:59WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks up but off session highs; S&P 500 near 3000 levelA strong start for the major averages has lost some steam, leaving the S&P 500 (+0.3%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) with modest gains. Weakness in IBM (IBM 133.35, -8.76, -6.2%) after a revenue miss is weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch) and S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.4%).The broader market remains slightly higher, though, thanks to relative strength in the S&P 500 health care (+0.9%), real estate (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.7%) sectors. Positive reactions to earnings reports from Honeywell (HON 167.99, +4.34, +2.7%), CSX (CSX 70.21, +1.22, +1.8%), and Union Pacific (UNP 165.48, +2.17, +1.3%) are supporting the industrials sector.As for health care, the group appears to be benefiting from a view that opioid litigation could be settled for a total package of $50 billion, according to Reuters. Companies involved in the offer include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 137.13, +1.96, +1.5%), Teva Pharma (TEVA 7.43, +0.48, +7.0%), McKesson (MCK 150.58, +5.76, +3.9%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.01, +1.94, +4.0%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.12, +3.08, +3.6%).Some cautious views on Brexit and a U.S.-China trade deal, meanwhile, may be restraining some buying conviction. A draft Brexit deal was announced, but some parties have already expressed their disapproval in front of a key vote this weekend. Separately, a report out of China reminded investors that Beijing wants all tariffs removed in order to end trade tensions.Isolated earnings reactions belong to Netflix (NFLX 298.10, +11.82, +4.1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS 43.83, +1.03, +2.4%). Netflix provided results that are being construed as better than feared, while Morgan Stanley beat top and bottom-line estimates.U.S. Treasuries have been on a steady rebound from overnight lows, leaving yields slightly lower. Germany lowering its 2020 growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.5% may have increased demand. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down two basis points to 1.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 97.58.Reviewing today's economic data:Total housing starts declined a disappointing 9.4% m/m in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.306 million). Building permits declined 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.387 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.350 million).The key takeaway from the Housing Starts and Building Permits report is that the month-over-month weakness was a function of downturns for multi-unit dwellings. Single-family starts were up 0.3% to 918,000 while single-family permits were up 0.8% to 882,000.Initial claims for the week ending October 12 increased by 4,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 5 decreased by 10,000 to 1.679 million.The key takeaway from the initial claims report is that it bodes well for another solid increase in October nonfarm payrolls, as this report covers the period in which the survey for the October employment report was conducted.Industrial production declined 0.4% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus -0.3%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 0.6%) in August. Total capacity utilization dropped to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.7%) from 77.9% in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the weakness was unduly influenced by the strike at General Motors (GM), which contributed to a 0.7% decline in the manufacturing output for durables.The Philadelphia Fed Index for October checked in at 5.6 (Briefing.com consensus 6.0) versus 12.0 in September.12:44SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: CRON (35.22 mln +2.44%), TEVA (28.24 mln +7.63%), ENDP (20.57 mln +16.35%), ACB (12.95 mln +5.12%)Materials: X (21.54 mln +0.47%)Industrials: GE (16.07 mln +1.69%)Consumer Discretionary: F (14.83 mln +0.06%), NIO (12.97 mln -0.34%), ROKU (12.14 mln +4.06%)Information Technology: NOK (24.93 mln +1.28%), AMD (24.19 mln +0.52%), INFY (23.96 mln -0.47%), ERIC (14.06 mln +4.59%), MSFT (11.01 mln -0.68%)Financials: BAC (32.3 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (32.87 mln -1.53%), MDR (11.41 mln +6.6%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: ASMB (9.46x +39.91%), CRON (8.51x +2.44%), NTRA (3.21x +3.9%), RCUS (2.2x +4.56%), ENDP (2.1x +16.35%), KNSA (2.05x -4.92%)Materials: CCK (2.97x +6.86%), LOMA (2.11x +5.57%)Industrials: URI (2.56x +0.85%), GTLS (1.94x +1.56%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (5.1x -46.13%)Information Technology: WNS (3.89x +6.4%), IBM (3.26x -6.32%), PAGS (3.23x +0.76%), ERIC (2.5x +4.59%)Consumer Staples: UN (3.19x +1.39%)12:43SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ASMB (17.79 +39.91%), ENDP (4.84 +16.35%), CLVS (3.61 +12.66%), MNK (2.48 +10.71%), TEVA (7.48 +7.63%), DPLO (5.16 +7.28%)Materials: CCK (67.89 +6.86%), HL (1.99 +6.72%), NGD (0.98 +6.62%), AA (20.35 +6.21%)Consumer Discretionary: TTM (9.78 +9.34%), POOL (216.91 +8.06%)Information Technology: FIT (3.98 +6.51%), WNS (64.38 +6.4%)Energy: REI (1.8 +9.09%), MDR (2.51 +6.6%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: AKCA (18.07 -7.66%), INO (2.34 -6.61%), ABEO (2.3 -5.54%), KNSA (5.32 -4.92%)Industrials: TXT (47.85 -5.19%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (0.6 -46.13%), IGT (13.6 -5.29%), BZUN (42.26 -5.24%), FNKO (18.13 -3.95%)Information Technology: IBM (133.13 -6.32%)Financials: MTB (151.24 -4.84%), EWBC (41.57 -4.66%), UMPQ (15.35 -3.88%)Energy: XOG (2.27 -9.56%), SPN (0.42 -9.21%), NBR (1.72 -6.01%), ESV (5.34 -4.86%), GTE (1.07 -4.05%)Consumer Staples: NBEV (2.86 -7%)12:27RHHBY Roche Hldg receives FDA approval for Xofluza sNDA for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza (36.42 +0.68)12:18SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Syros Pharmaceuticals (SYRS) sinks after discontinuing SY-1365 development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersASMB (17.4 +36.85%): The stock, currently trading with circa 10x average volume, sees a notable extension of yesterday's strength; it advanced on Wednesday after announcing that data for its lead HBV core inhibitor candidates, ABI-H0731 and ABI-H2158, for the treatment of chronic HBV will be featured in a late-breaking poster session during the AASLD Annual Meeting in November. At six-month highs.LLNW (3.88 +24.2%): Reported in-line Q3 EPS on upside revs (+4.1% yr/yr to $51.32 mln, or +12% sequentially) and reaffirmed its FY19 EPS and revs guidance. Co noted that it set a new record for traffic during the quarter, exceeding the previous record by approx. +20%. It credits accelerated investments in infrastructure, significant growth in capacity, and fiscal discipline for the quarter's results and notes that it expects Q4 to see yr/yr acceleration in revenue growth as well as improvements in gross margin and overall profitability. At 11-month highs. ENDP (4.93 +18.39%): Continued strength for co and various other drug manufacturers amid reported opioid settlement talks. At four-month highs.Small Cap LosersSYRS (6.85 -32.18%): Announced that it will discontinue further development of SY-1365, its intravenous CDK7 inhibitor, as it turns to prioritizing the development of oral CDK7 inhibitor SY-5609, for which it expects to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with select solid tumors in the first quarter of 2020. Co notes that SY-5609 demonstrated greater anti-tumor activity than did SY-1365 in multiple preclinical models and that SY-1365 "did not support an optimal profile for patients" in initial data from the expansion of the Phase 1 trial of SY-1365. Co identifies SY-5609 as the more selective and more potent CDK7 inhibitor and believes that it has "best-in-class potential." At three-month lows.XOG (2.28 -9.36%): Downgraded to Underperform from Outperform and price target cut to $2 from $7 at Imperial Capital, citing expectations for flat Q3 production levels, owing to unplanned outages in co's Western Gas system and startup delays for the Rimrock system, and noting fundamental riskiness in co's business model relative to DJ Basin peers, among other factors. At new all-time lows. ZIOP (3.84 -4.36%): Sees continued weakness; the stock slid lower yesterday afternoon following a cautious mention at Alpha Exposure. The stock today trades at its new lowest levels since March.12:04SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (104) outpacing new lows (21) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAN, ACM, AIV, AMAT, AMKR, ATKR, AVB, AYR, BHE, BLD, BLDR, BMCH, BRX, BZH, CCK, CCMP, CCS, CELG, CETV, CHCT, CHTR, CNS, COLD, CPB, CROX, CSTM, DCOM, DEA, DHI, DLR, DLTR, DOV, ENTG, EPRT, ETR, FBHS, FCN, FORM, FSP, GLIBA, GNRC, GWR, HCP, HD, HTA, HTLD, IBP, INFO, INVH, INXN, IRT, KBH, KLAC, KMX, KN, KOD, KRNT, KSU, LBRDK, LEN, LGIH, LTC, LULU, MAA, MAS, MCK, MDC, MDCO, MHO, MTH, MTZ, NFBK, NKE, NSA, O, ODFL, OHI, PFSI, PHM, PLD, PLMR, PLUG, POOL, RETA, REXR, RH, RLI, ROST, SHW, SJW, SNX, TGT, THG, TJX, TMHC, TPH, TRNO, UDR, VFC, WGO, WLH, WMS, WTR, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: CAAP, CBS, CJ, CRC, CRWD, ENLC, FIXX, FTSI, GTLS, GTYH, HEP, LGF.A, MTDR, PBT, PK, SCPL, SLCA, SM, TEUM, VIAB, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: BRT, IRET, NVMIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: FULC, KLDO, MIRM, RMNIETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWN, EWT, IOO, ITB, PSK, RTH, XHBETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX11:54AXP American Express Earnings Preview- Investors look for strong consumer to offset commercial weakness (118.13 +0.72)American Express (AXP) is set to report Q3 results tomorrow before the market opens with a conference call to follow at 8:30am ET.Current Capital IQ stands at EPS of $2.02 on Revenue of $10.9 bln.9/23- Increased dividend to $0.43 from $0.39 and announced a new 120 mln share repurchase.FY19 EPS Outlook in the $7.85-8.35 range. At the Barclays conference on September 10, AXP laid out the reasoning behind its wider than usual range for EPS guidance. That was due to the uncertainty in the economic environment. Comments at Barclays suggested AXP would see the middle of that range. So analysts are expecting company to tighten the outlook. The midpoint will be key with current Capital IQ consensus sitting at $8.10. The primary weakness for AXP is around its commercial end which makes up 42% of the business. The consumer remains strong.FY19 Revenue Growth in the range of 8-10%. AXP has reaffirmed this number the past two quarters despite only posting growth of 6.6% in Q1 and 8.4% in Q2. This has investors looking at the company either posting a back end loaded revenue number, which may be difficult given the slow down in commercial, or for AXP to lower the high end of this estimate.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jun) earnings of $2.07 per share, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.02. Revenues rose 8.4% year/year to $10.84 bln vs the $10.82 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Consolidated provisions for losses were $861 million, up 7 percent from $806 million a year ago. The increase reflected higher net lending write-offs driven by loan growth. Consolidated expenses were $7.8 billion, up 9 percent from $7.1 billion a year ago. The rise reflected, in part, growth in rewards and other customer engagement costs driven by increased Card Member spending, higher usage of card benefits and continued investments in cobrand partnerships.

The laggard of note is the information technology sector (-0.3%), which is being weighed down by the response to IBM's (IBM 134.26, -7.85, -5.5%) relatively disappointing earnings report.The health care sector is benefiting from news of a potential opioid settlement being in the works, which is leading to outsized gains for drug distributor stocks like McKesson (MCK 150.20, +5.36, +3.7%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.15, +2.08, +4.2%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.36, +3.31, +3.9%).

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed. It hasn't had a more pronounced impact, though, for several reasons:The U.S. market has never been fully bothered by the idea of a disorderly Brexit, content it seems to see it as more of an issue for the UK and the EU.There is ample doubt still that it will win approval in Parliament.The relatively subdued response in the UK's FTSE 100 (+0.5%) and in the British pound (+0.2% against the dollar) suggests there is reason to keep enthusiasm in check at the moment.08:04BYSI BeyondSpring: US Patent Office has granted the Company a new patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,357,491 B2, for methods of treating a brain tumor by administering Plinabulin (18.30 )The patent, which expires in 2036, covers methods for Plinabulin's use in the treatment of brain tumors, including metastatic brain tumor, with no approved chemotherapy on the market, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common adult brain tumor.

With the positive momentum we continue to see in our Towers and Fiber segments, we remain focused on investing in our business to generate future growth while delivering dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year."16:22UMPQ Umpqua Holdings beats by $0.01 (15.97 -0.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.38 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.37.Net interest income increased by $1.8 million on a quarter to quarter basis primarily driven by higher average balances of loans and leases along with a lower level of premium amortization for residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, partially offset by lower average yields on loans and leases;Net interest margin was 3.63% for the third quarter of 2019, down seven basis points from 3.70% for the second quarter of 2019 primarily driven by the decrease in short-term interest rates during the quarter.16:20AA Alcoa misses by $0.16, reports revs in-line; announces multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs; intends to pursue non-core asset sales (19.16 -0.29)Reports Q3 (Sep) loss of $(0.44) per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.16 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.28); revenues fell 24.3% year/year to $2.57 bln vs the $2.58 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co reports Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $388 mln vs consensus of $369 mln. This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability. Over the next 12-18 months, Alcoa intends to pursue non-core asset sales expected to generate an estimated $500 mln to $1 bln in net proceeds. Co estimates approx $50-100 mln in reduced adjusted EBITDA due to such asset sales. Over the next five years, Alcoa plans to realign its operating portfolio, and has placed under review 1.5 mln metric tons of smelting capacity and 4 mln metric tons of alumina refining capacity. The review will consider opportunities for significant improvement, potential curtailments, closures or divestitures.Alcoa refines strategic priorities, co has updated Strengthen the Balance Sheet to Advance Sustainably. This priority encompasses both financial sustainability through balance sheet improvements and portfolio transformation.For full-year 2019, Alcoa continues to project a global aluminum deficit, ranging between 800 thousand and 1.2 million metric tons, down slightly from the previous quarter's estimate of a deficit between 1.0 million and 1.4 million metric tons.16:19CNXM CNX Midstream Partners increases quarterly cash distribution to $0.4001/unit from $0.3865/unit (12.98 -0.05)16:19EGBN Eagle Bancorp beats by $0.01, beats on revs (42.62 0.00)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.07 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.06; revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $87.3 mln vs the $81.08 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.The net interest margin ("NIM") in the third quarter of 2019 was 3.72% as compared to 3.91% in the second quarter of 2019 and 4.14% for the third quarter of 2018.Net interest income decreased less than 1% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 from the same period in 2018 ($81.0 million versus $81.3 million), resulting from compressed margins associated with increased costs of funds and lower loan yields due in part to enhanced competitive pressure more than offsetting growth in average earning assets of 11%.16:19URI United Rentals beats by $0.19, beats on revs; narrows FY19 revs guidance, still inline (121.71 +0.99)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $5.96 per share, $0.19 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $5.77; revenues rose 17.6% year/year to $2.49 bln vs the $2.46 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA is currently estimated to be approximately 3 percent below budget, primarily due to the delay in Elba's in-service date, lower commodity prices and volumes impacting the CO2 segment, and the impact of 501-G settlements, partially offset by the strong performance of the West Region Natural Gas16:06CGNX Cognex acquires industrial machine vision software developer SUALAB (48.88 -0.26)SUALAB is a Korean-based developer of vision software using deep learning for industrial applications.

Most sectors are up, but only one sector -- health care (+1.0%) -- is up at least 1.0%. One of the other leading sectors is the industrials sector (+0.8%).The relative strength among the industrials is owed in general to improved sentiment regarding the global growth outlook and specifically to positive moves made by several components following their earnings reports:Honeywell (HON 168.72, +5.09, +3.1%) beat Q3 earnings estimates and raised the low end of its FY19 adjusted EPS guidance range.Dover (DOV 101.22, +5.40, +5.6%) beat Q3 earnings and revenue estimates and narrowed its FY19 adjusted EPS guidance to the upper end of its prior guidance range.CSX Corp. (CSX 70.15, +1.15, +1.7%) exceeded the Q3 consensus EPS estimate, but industry peer Union Pacific (UNP 164.10, +0.79, +0.5%) came up short of expectations. Both railroad operators, however, impressed with their operating ratios.United Rentals (URI 127.83, +6.16, +5.1%) surpassed Q3 earnings and revenue estimates and provided a narrowed FY19 revenue guidance range that was slightly higher than the consensus estimate at the midpoint.Overall gains for the sector have been held in check, however, by weakness in Boeing (BA 370.02, -2.41, -0.7%), which follows news from Southwest (LUV 53.90, +0.23, +0.4%) that it's removing the 737 MAX from its flight schedule at least through February 8, and weakness in the defense stocks after Textron (TXT 48.13, -2.34, -4.6%) posted better-than-expected earnings results for the third quarter but noted that it saw lower defense volume for its Aviation segment and lower military volume for its Bell segment.14:31COMDX Energy Settlement PricesNov Crude Oil futures rose $0.34 (0.64%) to $53.76/barrel Nov Natural Gas closed flat at $2.32/MMBtu Nov RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 lower (-0.61%) at $1.62/gallon Nov Heating oil futures settled flat at $1.93/gallon14:26OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AXP Oct 120 calls (volume: 3910, open int: 390, implied vol: ~60%, prev day implied vol: 47%).

In fact, the company has exceeded EPS and revenue estimates for fifteen straight quarters.Additionally, its top-line growth has remained very consistent, ranging from 35-45% during this stretch.The steady results are impressive and have helped protect it from the onslaught that has buried many expensive cloud software stocks.While TEAM has shed 17% from its highs reached in August, names like Twilio (TWLO), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Zoom Video (ZM), and Workday (WDAY) have suffered larger losses. Since early August, those stocks are down 27%, 42%, 24%, and 20%, respectively.It is worth noting, though, that TEAM does have a history of issuing conservative guidance. It also has a history of barely edging out those quarterly expectations.For instance, for 3Q19 it issued inline EPS guidance and for 4Q19 it issued downside EPS guidance. On both occasions, TEAM's revenue guidance was slightly ahead of forecasts.Furthermore, the degree of its earnings beats has averaged a modest $0.02/share over the past eight quarters. With a 1-year forward P/S of ~15.5x, the margin for error is slim so even a slight deviation from these small beats could have a meaningful impact on the stock.1Q20 Expectations: Last quarter (4Q19), TEAM provided upside 1Q20 EPS guidance of $0.24 vs. the $0.21 consensus with revenue of $349-$353 mln compared to the $349.6 mln estimate.Despite TEAM's long track record of beating its own guidance, analysts' estimates match TEAM's outlook at EPS of $0.24 and revenue of $352 mln.Key Metrics: Unlike many cloud software companies, TEAM doesn't disclose many operating metrics, such as annual recurring revenue, retention rate, or large customer additions. Also unlike many cloud software companies, TEAM doesn't heavily focus on billings because it doesn't enter into many multi-year contracts.Operating margin is one metric that TEAM does highlight, though. Last quarter, Non-GAAP operating margin slipped 300 bps yr/yr to 17.0%. For this quarter, TEAM guided for operating margin of (3.0)%.Guidance: In the earnings press release, TEAM will likely provide EPS and revenue guidance for 2Q20. In order to meet expectations, it will need to guide for EPS of $0.26 and revenue of $381.5 mln.13:52COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $5.30 (0.36%) at $1497.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.18 higher (1.03%) at $17.6/oz Dec copper settled $0.01 higher (0.39%) at $2.6/lb13:21HMHC Houghton Mifflin Harcourt sees Q3 revs below consensus, raises FY 19 billings outlook, and announces 'workforce reductions' (4.89 -0.13)For the fiscal third quarter, the Company expects to report(1) net sales of $563 million vs $596 mln consensusThird quarter billings are expected to be $746 million, representing record growth of 30%, driven by expected Core Solutions billings growth of 50%, and expected Extensions billings growth of 25% compared to Q3'18HMH today updated its 2019 full year outlook to include its expectation of free cash flow in a range of $100 million to $120 million. Also, in light of its strong year-to-date financial performance, HMH revised its full year 2019 billings guidance range, which was previously $1,530 million to $1,610 million, to $1,590 million to $1,620 million with content development spend expected to be between $100 to $110 million and total capital expenditures to be between $150 and $160 million. The co also announced actions that are creating new product development and go-to-market capabilities, as well as the streamlining of operations company-wide for greater efficiency. These actions are expected to result in the elimination of 8% of HMH's workforce, after taking into account new strategy-aligned positions that are expected to be added and additional operating and capitalized cost reductions, including a redesigned product development model that is expected to result in approximately 20% less content development expenditures than previously planned over the next three years starting in 2020.13:02FIT Fitbit jumps 6% after announcing collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance (3.98 +0.24)The Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance and Fitbit today announced at the TIME 100 Health Summit in New York that they are working together to help drive timely diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with the aim of improving earlier detection in individuals at increased risk of stroke. The BMS-Pfizer Alliance and Fitbit plan to collaborate on the development of educational content and guidance to support people at increased risk for AFib. Upon submission and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the AFib detection software on Fitbit devices, the parties will aim to provide users with appropriate information to help encourage and inform discussions with their physicians.12:59WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks up but off session highs; S&P 500 near 3000 levelA strong start for the major averages has lost some steam, leaving the S&P 500 (+0.3%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) with modest gains. Weakness in IBM (IBM 133.35, -8.76, -6.2%) after a revenue miss is weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch) and S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.4%).The broader market remains slightly higher, though, thanks to relative strength in the S&P 500 health care (+0.9%), real estate (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.7%) sectors. Positive reactions to earnings reports from Honeywell (HON 167.99, +4.34, +2.7%), CSX (CSX 70.21, +1.22, +1.8%), and Union Pacific (UNP 165.48, +2.17, +1.3%) are supporting the industrials sector.As for health care, the group appears to be benefiting from a view that opioid litigation could be settled for a total package of $50 billion, according to Reuters. Companies involved in the offer include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 137.13, +1.96, +1.5%), Teva Pharma (TEVA 7.43, +0.48, +7.0%), McKesson (MCK 150.58, +5.76, +3.9%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.01, +1.94, +4.0%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.12, +3.08, +3.6%).Some cautious views on Brexit and a U.S.-China trade deal, meanwhile, may be restraining some buying conviction. A draft Brexit deal was announced, but some parties have already expressed their disapproval in front of a key vote this weekend. Separately, a report out of China reminded investors that Beijing wants all tariffs removed in order to end trade tensions.Isolated earnings reactions belong to Netflix (NFLX 298.10, +11.82, +4.1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS 43.83, +1.03, +2.4%). Netflix provided results that are being construed as better than feared, while Morgan Stanley beat top and bottom-line estimates.U.S. Treasuries have been on a steady rebound from overnight lows, leaving yields slightly lower. Germany lowering its 2020 growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.5% may have increased demand. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down two basis points to 1.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 97.58.Reviewing today's economic data:Total housing starts declined a disappointing 9.4% m/m in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.306 million). Building permits declined 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.387 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.350 million).The key takeaway from the Housing Starts and Building Permits report is that the month-over-month weakness was a function of downturns for multi-unit dwellings. Single-family starts were up 0.3% to 918,000 while single-family permits were up 0.8% to 882,000.Initial claims for the week ending October 12 increased by 4,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 5 decreased by 10,000 to 1.679 million.The key takeaway from the initial claims report is that it bodes well for another solid increase in October nonfarm payrolls, as this report covers the period in which the survey for the October employment report was conducted.Industrial production declined 0.4% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus -0.3%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 0.6%) in August. Total capacity utilization dropped to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.7%) from 77.9% in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the weakness was unduly influenced by the strike at General Motors (GM), which contributed to a 0.7% decline in the manufacturing output for durables.The Philadelphia Fed Index for October checked in at 5.6 (Briefing.com consensus 6.0) versus 12.0 in September.12:44SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: CRON (35.22 mln +2.44%), TEVA (28.24 mln +7.63%), ENDP (20.57 mln +16.35%), ACB (12.95 mln +5.12%)Materials: X (21.54 mln +0.47%)Industrials: GE (16.07 mln +1.69%)Consumer Discretionary: F (14.83 mln +0.06%), NIO (12.97 mln -0.34%), ROKU (12.14 mln +4.06%)Information Technology: NOK (24.93 mln +1.28%), AMD (24.19 mln +0.52%), INFY (23.96 mln -0.47%), ERIC (14.06 mln +4.59%), MSFT (11.01 mln -0.68%)Financials: BAC (32.3 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (32.87 mln -1.53%), MDR (11.41 mln +6.6%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: ASMB (9.46x +39.91%), CRON (8.51x +2.44%), NTRA (3.21x +3.9%), RCUS (2.2x +4.56%), ENDP (2.1x +16.35%), KNSA (2.05x -4.92%)Materials: CCK (2.97x +6.86%), LOMA (2.11x +5.57%)Industrials: URI (2.56x +0.85%), GTLS (1.94x +1.56%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (5.1x -46.13%)Information Technology: WNS (3.89x +6.4%), IBM (3.26x -6.32%), PAGS (3.23x +0.76%), ERIC (2.5x +4.59%)Consumer Staples: UN (3.19x +1.39%)12:43SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ASMB (17.79 +39.91%), ENDP (4.84 +16.35%), CLVS (3.61 +12.66%), MNK (2.48 +10.71%), TEVA (7.48 +7.63%), DPLO (5.16 +7.28%)Materials: CCK (67.89 +6.86%), HL (1.99 +6.72%), NGD (0.98 +6.62%), AA (20.35 +6.21%)Consumer Discretionary: TTM (9.78 +9.34%), POOL (216.91 +8.06%)Information Technology: FIT (3.98 +6.51%), WNS (64.38 +6.4%)Energy: REI (1.8 +9.09%), MDR (2.51 +6.6%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: AKCA (18.07 -7.66%), INO (2.34 -6.61%), ABEO (2.3 -5.54%), KNSA (5.32 -4.92%)Industrials: TXT (47.85 -5.19%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (0.6 -46.13%), IGT (13.6 -5.29%), BZUN (42.26 -5.24%), FNKO (18.13 -3.95%)Information Technology: IBM (133.13 -6.32%)Financials: MTB (151.24 -4.84%), EWBC (41.57 -4.66%), UMPQ (15.35 -3.88%)Energy: XOG (2.27 -9.56%), SPN (0.42 -9.21%), NBR (1.72 -6.01%), ESV (5.34 -4.86%), GTE (1.07 -4.05%)Consumer Staples: NBEV (2.86 -7%)12:27RHHBY Roche Hldg receives FDA approval for Xofluza sNDA for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza (36.42 +0.68)12:18SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Syros Pharmaceuticals (SYRS) sinks after discontinuing SY-1365 development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersASMB (17.4 +36.85%): The stock, currently trading with circa 10x average volume, sees a notable extension of yesterday's strength; it advanced on Wednesday after announcing that data for its lead HBV core inhibitor candidates, ABI-H0731 and ABI-H2158, for the treatment of chronic HBV will be featured in a late-breaking poster session during the AASLD Annual Meeting in November. At six-month highs.LLNW (3.88 +24.2%): Reported in-line Q3 EPS on upside revs (+4.1% yr/yr to $51.32 mln, or +12% sequentially) and reaffirmed its FY19 EPS and revs guidance. Co noted that it set a new record for traffic during the quarter, exceeding the previous record by approx. +20%. It credits accelerated investments in infrastructure, significant growth in capacity, and fiscal discipline for the quarter's results and notes that it expects Q4 to see yr/yr acceleration in revenue growth as well as improvements in gross margin and overall profitability. At 11-month highs. ENDP (4.93 +18.39%): Continued strength for co and various other drug manufacturers amid reported opioid settlement talks. At four-month highs.Small Cap LosersSYRS (6.85 -32.18%): Announced that it will discontinue further development of SY-1365, its intravenous CDK7 inhibitor, as it turns to prioritizing the development of oral CDK7 inhibitor SY-5609, for which it expects to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with select solid tumors in the first quarter of 2020. Co notes that SY-5609 demonstrated greater anti-tumor activity than did SY-1365 in multiple preclinical models and that SY-1365 "did not support an optimal profile for patients" in initial data from the expansion of the Phase 1 trial of SY-1365. Co identifies SY-5609 as the more selective and more potent CDK7 inhibitor and believes that it has "best-in-class potential." At three-month lows.XOG (2.28 -9.36%): Downgraded to Underperform from Outperform and price target cut to $2 from $7 at Imperial Capital, citing expectations for flat Q3 production levels, owing to unplanned outages in co's Western Gas system and startup delays for the Rimrock system, and noting fundamental riskiness in co's business model relative to DJ Basin peers, among other factors. At new all-time lows. ZIOP (3.84 -4.36%): Sees continued weakness; the stock slid lower yesterday afternoon following a cautious mention at Alpha Exposure.

At the Barclays conference on September 10, AXP laid out the reasoning behind its wider than usual range for EPS guidance. That was due to the uncertainty in the economic environment. Comments at Barclays suggested AXP would see the middle of that range. So analysts are expecting company to tighten the outlook. The midpoint will be key with current Capital IQ consensus sitting at $8.10. The primary weakness for AXP is around its commercial end which makes up 42% of the business. The consumer remains strong.FY19 Revenue Growth in the range of 8-10%. AXP has reaffirmed this number the past two quarters despite only posting growth of 6.6% in Q1 and 8.4% in Q2. This has investors looking at the company either posting a back end loaded revenue number, which may be difficult given the slow down in commercial, or for AXP to lower the high end of this estimate.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jun) earnings of $2.07 per share, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.02. Revenues rose 8.4% year/year to $10.84 bln vs the $10.82 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Consolidated provisions for losses were $861 million, up 7 percent from $806 million a year ago. The increase reflected higher net lending write-offs driven by loan growth. Consolidated expenses were $7.8 billion, up 9 percent from $7.1 billion a year ago. The rise reflected, in part, growth in rewards and other customer engagement costs driven by increased Card Member spending, higher usage of card benefits and continued investments in cobrand partnerships. Operating expenses were up 7 percent from a year ago.Co reaffirmed guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $7.85-8.35 vs. $8.09 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The laggard of note is the information technology sector (-0.3%), which is being weighed down by the response to IBM's (IBM 134.26, -7.85, -5.5%) relatively disappointing earnings report.The health care sector is benefiting from news of a potential opioid settlement being in the works, which is leading to outsized gains for drug distributor stocks like McKesson (MCK 150.20, +5.36, +3.7%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.15, +2.08, +4.2%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.36, +3.31, +3.9%). The industrials sector is benefiting from positive responses to the earnings reports out of Honeywell (HON 168.00, +4.37, +2.7%), Dover (DOV 101.10, +5.28, +5.5%), United Rentals (URI 128.96, +7.29, +6.0%), CSX Corp. (CSX 70.58, +1.58, +2.3%) and Union Pacific (UNP 164.61, +1.30, +0.8%).Separately, the market has gotten a bit of a boost from reports that a Brexit compromise has been reached between the UK and EU; however, complete enthusiasm has been held in check by commensurate reports highlighting opposition from some parties that could negate this "deal."Speaking of deals, the "phase one" deal between the U.S. and China is still raising questions for market participants that is acting as a restraint on buyer confidence. According to a South China Morning Post report today, China is open to a partial deal, but says trade tensions will only end when all tariffs are lifted.The Russell 2000 is up 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are up 0.3%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%.11:19BRBR BellRing Brands opened for trading at $15.60 after pricing IPO at $1411:09MRTX Mirati Therapeutics +5% after confirming MRTX849 data presentations (84.07 +3.71)Mirati Therapeutics announced this morning that it will present pre-clinical data and initial clinical data for MRTX849, its novel and otpimized KRAS G12C inhibitor, in presentations at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, which will be held in Boston on October 26-30. Among these presentations, pre-clinical MRTX849 data will be showcased in an oral presentation, "The KRAS G12C Inhibitor, MRTX849, Provides Insight Toward Therapeutic Susceptibility of KRAS Mutant Cancers," in the afternoon on October 28, beginning at 4:20 p.m. EDT.The stock spiked by as much as 9% following the announcement.11:04IYT Better than feared results from rail carriers boost transport stocks (188.59 +1.21)Transport stocks have shown relative strength in the early going, helping the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.6%) extend this week's gain to 2.0%.Today's advance is receiving broad-based support, as all 20 components trade with gains while four group members are up more than 1.0%. Rail carriers CSX (CSX 70.54, +1.54, +2.2%) and Union-Pacific (UNP 164.68, +1.37, +0.8%) trade solidly higher after both companies reported their Q3 results. CSX exceeded earnings and revenue expectations while Union-Pacific missed. However, both companies showed an improvement in efficiency, which is being rewarded by the market.Another DJTA component-Kansas City Southern (KSU 134.79, +0.50, +0.4%)-will report its Q3 results ahead of tomorrow's open.Today's rally has lifted the DJTA to its best level in nearly a month, but the economically sensitive group remains inside a sideways range that has been in place for almost two years. The top of that range, which is about 10% above the current price level, was marked last September while the bottom, 18% below the current level, was notched in December 2018.11:01ECONX Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the week ending October 11, 2019U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15.4 million barrels per day during the week ending October 11, 2019, which was 221,000 barrels per day less than the previous week's average.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed.

Dr. Lee and colleagues concluded that the savolitinib monotherapy trial also met the pre-specified 6-week progression free survival rate, indicating that it is worthy of further exploration in the MET amplification subset of patients with gastric cancer.06:12STLD Steel Dynamics reports EPS in-line, misses on revs (28.84 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.69 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.69; revenues fell 21.6% year/year to $2.53 bln vs the $2.67 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Outlook "Based on domestic steel demand fundamentals, we are constructive regarding 2020 North American steel market dynamics. We believe North American steel consumption will experience modest growth and will be supported by further steel import reductions and the end of steel inventory destocking.

S&P Futures are back above that critical 3000 level and currently trading around the 3004 area. This is just off the session high of 3006.50 and left the overnight low sitting at 2985.25.In Asia, both the Nikkei and Shanghai closed fractionally lower on the day. The Shanghai opened higher but could not manage to maintain gains despite reports that the Chinese government is mulling loosening restrictions for foreign investors. The Nikkei was led lower by tech stocks. Tokyo Electron fell 9% after chip peer ASML saw weakness following earnings on Wednesday. In Europe, the major bourses are witnessing a mixed tape with the FTSE outpacing the region. The status of Brexit talks remains the key focus. The British pound has seen a volatile session and is up nearly 1%. This has not weighed on the FTSE, however. Outside of the UK, the markets have seen more of a cautious environment.

Guidance for 2019 remains unchanged. Recent test results from Kisladag confirm that recoveries from leaching deeper material over 250-day cycles support an extension of mine life beyond the company's current three-year guidance. Waste stripping to support a mine life extension will commence prior to the end of October. Test work is still ongoing to determine the ultimate heap leach recovery of this material and thus the ultimate length of the mine life extension. Waste stripping over the remainder of 2019 is expected to minimize production interruptions in 2020 and beyond. Estimated expenditure for waste stripping in 2019 is $4 mln. Production at Olympias was lower than plan. During the third quarter, measures to increase production volumes were continued in key areas of the operation and will support the ramp up towards 2020 and beyond. These measures included increased capital development resources and other operational improvement initiatives.17:37WTFC Wintrust Fin beats by $0.07, beats on revs (64.50 -0.29)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.69 per share, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.62; revenues rose 9.4% year/year to $380 mln vs the $374.98 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.17:36CCK Crown reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; guides Q4 EPS below consensus (63.53 +0.67)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.56 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.56; revenues fell 2.8% year/year to $3.08 bln vs the $3.19 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020.

Most sectors are up, but only one sector -- health care (+1.0%) -- is up at least 1.0%. One of the other leading sectors is the industrials sector (+0.8%).The relative strength among the industrials is owed in general to improved sentiment regarding the global growth outlook and specifically to positive moves made by several components following their earnings reports:Honeywell (HON 168.72, +5.09, +3.1%) beat Q3 earnings estimates and raised the low end of its FY19 adjusted EPS guidance range.Dover (DOV 101.22, +5.40, +5.6%) beat Q3 earnings and revenue estimates and narrowed its FY19 adjusted EPS guidance to the upper end of its prior guidance range.CSX Corp. (CSX 70.15, +1.15, +1.7%) exceeded the Q3 consensus EPS estimate, but industry peer Union Pacific (UNP 164.10, +0.79, +0.5%) came up short of expectations. Both railroad operators, however, impressed with their operating ratios.United Rentals (URI 127.83, +6.16, +5.1%) surpassed Q3 earnings and revenue estimates and provided a narrowed FY19 revenue guidance range that was slightly higher than the consensus estimate at the midpoint.Overall gains for the sector have been held in check, however, by weakness in Boeing (BA 370.02, -2.41, -0.7%), which follows news from Southwest (LUV 53.90, +0.23, +0.4%) that it's removing the 737 MAX from its flight schedule at least through February 8, and weakness in the defense stocks after Textron (TXT 48.13, -2.34, -4.6%) posted better-than-expected earnings results for the third quarter but noted that it saw lower defense volume for its Aviation segment and lower military volume for its Bell segment.14:31COMDX Energy Settlement PricesNov Crude Oil futures rose $0.34 (0.64%) to $53.76/barrel Nov Natural Gas closed flat at $2.32/MMBtu Nov RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 lower (-0.61%) at $1.62/gallon Nov Heating oil futures settled flat at $1.93/gallon14:26OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AXP Oct 120 calls (volume: 3910, open int: 390, implied vol: ~60%, prev day implied vol: 47%).

In fact, the company has exceeded EPS and revenue estimates for fifteen straight quarters.Additionally, its top-line growth has remained very consistent, ranging from 35-45% during this stretch.The steady results are impressive and have helped protect it from the onslaught that has buried many expensive cloud software stocks.While TEAM has shed 17% from its highs reached in August, names like Twilio (TWLO), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Zoom Video (ZM), and Workday (WDAY) have suffered larger losses. Since early August, those stocks are down 27%, 42%, 24%, and 20%, respectively.It is worth noting, though, that TEAM does have a history of issuing conservative guidance. It also has a history of barely edging out those quarterly expectations.For instance, for 3Q19 it issued inline EPS guidance and for 4Q19 it issued downside EPS guidance. On both occasions, TEAM's revenue guidance was slightly ahead of forecasts.Furthermore, the degree of its earnings beats has averaged a modest $0.02/share over the past eight quarters. With a 1-year forward P/S of ~15.5x, the margin for error is slim so even a slight deviation from these small beats could have a meaningful impact on the stock.1Q20 Expectations: Last quarter (4Q19), TEAM provided upside 1Q20 EPS guidance of $0.24 vs. the $0.21 consensus with revenue of $349-$353 mln compared to the $349.6 mln estimate.Despite TEAM's long track record of beating its own guidance, analysts' estimates match TEAM's outlook at EPS of $0.24 and revenue of $352 mln.Key Metrics: Unlike many cloud software companies, TEAM doesn't disclose many operating metrics, such as annual recurring revenue, retention rate, or large customer additions. Also unlike many cloud software companies, TEAM doesn't heavily focus on billings because it doesn't enter into many multi-year contracts.Operating margin is one metric that TEAM does highlight, though. Last quarter, Non-GAAP operating margin slipped 300 bps yr/yr to 17.0%. For this quarter, TEAM guided for operating margin of (3.0)%.Guidance: In the earnings press release, TEAM will likely provide EPS and revenue guidance for 2Q20. In order to meet expectations, it will need to guide for EPS of $0.26 and revenue of $381.5 mln.13:52COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $5.30 (0.36%) at $1497.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.18 higher (1.03%) at $17.6/oz Dec copper settled $0.01 higher (0.39%) at $2.6/lb13:21HMHC Houghton Mifflin Harcourt sees Q3 revs below consensus, raises FY 19 billings outlook, and announces 'workforce reductions' (4.89 -0.13)For the fiscal third quarter, the Company expects to report(1) net sales of $563 million vs $596 mln consensusThird quarter billings are expected to be $746 million, representing record growth of 30%, driven by expected Core Solutions billings growth of 50%, and expected Extensions billings growth of 25% compared to Q3'18HMH today updated its 2019 full year outlook to include its expectation of free cash flow in a range of $100 million to $120 million. Also, in light of its strong year-to-date financial performance, HMH revised its full year 2019 billings guidance range, which was previously $1,530 million to $1,610 million, to $1,590 million to $1,620 million with content development spend expected to be between $100 to $110 million and total capital expenditures to be between $150 and $160 million. The co also announced actions that are creating new product development and go-to-market capabilities, as well as the streamlining of operations company-wide for greater efficiency. These actions are expected to result in the elimination of 8% of HMH's workforce, after taking into account new strategy-aligned positions that are expected to be added and additional operating and capitalized cost reductions, including a redesigned product development model that is expected to result in approximately 20% less content development expenditures than previously planned over the next three years starting in 2020.13:02FIT Fitbit jumps 6% after announcing collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance (3.98 +0.24)The Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance and Fitbit today announced at the TIME 100 Health Summit in New York that they are working together to help drive timely diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with the aim of improving earlier detection in individuals at increased risk of stroke. The BMS-Pfizer Alliance and Fitbit plan to collaborate on the development of educational content and guidance to support people at increased risk for AFib. Upon submission and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the AFib detection software on Fitbit devices, the parties will aim to provide users with appropriate information to help encourage and inform discussions with their physicians.12:59WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks up but off session highs; S&P 500 near 3000 levelA strong start for the major averages has lost some steam, leaving the S&P 500 (+0.3%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) with modest gains. Weakness in IBM (IBM 133.35, -8.76, -6.2%) after a revenue miss is weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch) and S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.4%).The broader market remains slightly higher, though, thanks to relative strength in the S&P 500 health care (+0.9%), real estate (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.7%) sectors. Positive reactions to earnings reports from Honeywell (HON 167.99, +4.34, +2.7%), CSX (CSX 70.21, +1.22, +1.8%), and Union Pacific (UNP 165.48, +2.17, +1.3%) are supporting the industrials sector.As for health care, the group appears to be benefiting from a view that opioid litigation could be settled for a total package of $50 billion, according to Reuters. Companies involved in the offer include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 137.13, +1.96, +1.5%), Teva Pharma (TEVA 7.43, +0.48, +7.0%), McKesson (MCK 150.58, +5.76, +3.9%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.01, +1.94, +4.0%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.12, +3.08, +3.6%).Some cautious views on Brexit and a U.S.-China trade deal, meanwhile, may be restraining some buying conviction. A draft Brexit deal was announced, but some parties have already expressed their disapproval in front of a key vote this weekend. Separately, a report out of China reminded investors that Beijing wants all tariffs removed in order to end trade tensions.Isolated earnings reactions belong to Netflix (NFLX 298.10, +11.82, +4.1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS 43.83, +1.03, +2.4%). Netflix provided results that are being construed as better than feared, while Morgan Stanley beat top and bottom-line estimates.U.S. Treasuries have been on a steady rebound from overnight lows, leaving yields slightly lower. Germany lowering its 2020 growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.5% may have increased demand. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down two basis points to 1.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 97.58.Reviewing today's economic data:Total housing starts declined a disappointing 9.4% m/m in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.306 million). Building permits declined 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.387 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.350 million).The key takeaway from the Housing Starts and Building Permits report is that the month-over-month weakness was a function of downturns for multi-unit dwellings. Single-family starts were up 0.3% to 918,000 while single-family permits were up 0.8% to 882,000.Initial claims for the week ending October 12 increased by 4,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 215,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 5 decreased by 10,000 to 1.679 million.The key takeaway from the initial claims report is that it bodes well for another solid increase in October nonfarm payrolls, as this report covers the period in which the survey for the October employment report was conducted.Industrial production declined 0.4% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus -0.3%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 0.6%) in August. Total capacity utilization dropped to 77.5% (Briefing.com consensus 77.7%) from 77.9% in August.The key takeaway from the report is that the weakness was unduly influenced by the strike at General Motors (GM), which contributed to a 0.7% decline in the manufacturing output for durables.The Philadelphia Fed Index for October checked in at 5.6 (Briefing.com consensus 6.0) versus 12.0 in September.12:44SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: CRON (35.22 mln +2.44%), TEVA (28.24 mln +7.63%), ENDP (20.57 mln +16.35%), ACB (12.95 mln +5.12%)Materials: X (21.54 mln +0.47%)Industrials: GE (16.07 mln +1.69%)Consumer Discretionary: F (14.83 mln +0.06%), NIO (12.97 mln -0.34%), ROKU (12.14 mln +4.06%)Information Technology: NOK (24.93 mln +1.28%), AMD (24.19 mln +0.52%), INFY (23.96 mln -0.47%), ERIC (14.06 mln +4.59%), MSFT (11.01 mln -0.68%)Financials: BAC (32.3 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (32.87 mln -1.53%), MDR (11.41 mln +6.6%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: ASMB (9.46x +39.91%), CRON (8.51x +2.44%), NTRA (3.21x +3.9%), RCUS (2.2x +4.56%), ENDP (2.1x +16.35%), KNSA (2.05x -4.92%)Materials: CCK (2.97x +6.86%), LOMA (2.11x +5.57%)Industrials: URI (2.56x +0.85%), GTLS (1.94x +1.56%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (5.1x -46.13%)Information Technology: WNS (3.89x +6.4%), IBM (3.26x -6.32%), PAGS (3.23x +0.76%), ERIC (2.5x +4.59%)Consumer Staples: UN (3.19x +1.39%)12:43SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ASMB (17.79 +39.91%), ENDP (4.84 +16.35%), CLVS (3.61 +12.66%), MNK (2.48 +10.71%), TEVA (7.48 +7.63%), DPLO (5.16 +7.28%)Materials: CCK (67.89 +6.86%), HL (1.99 +6.72%), NGD (0.98 +6.62%), AA (20.35 +6.21%)Consumer Discretionary: TTM (9.78 +9.34%), POOL (216.91 +8.06%)Information Technology: FIT (3.98 +6.51%), WNS (64.38 +6.4%)Energy: REI (1.8 +9.09%), MDR (2.51 +6.6%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: AKCA (18.07 -7.66%), INO (2.34 -6.61%), ABEO (2.3 -5.54%), KNSA (5.32 -4.92%)Industrials: TXT (47.85 -5.19%)Consumer Discretionary: WTRH (0.6 -46.13%), IGT (13.6 -5.29%), BZUN (42.26 -5.24%), FNKO (18.13 -3.95%)Information Technology: IBM (133.13 -6.32%)Financials: MTB (151.24 -4.84%), EWBC (41.57 -4.66%), UMPQ (15.35 -3.88%)Energy: XOG (2.27 -9.56%), SPN (0.42 -9.21%), NBR (1.72 -6.01%), ESV (5.34 -4.86%), GTE (1.07 -4.05%)Consumer Staples: NBEV (2.86 -7%)12:27RHHBY Roche Hldg receives FDA approval for Xofluza sNDA for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza (36.42 +0.68)12:18SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Syros Pharmaceuticals (SYRS) sinks after discontinuing SY-1365 development -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersASMB (17.4 +36.85%): The stock, currently trading with circa 10x average volume, sees a notable extension of yesterday's strength; it advanced on Wednesday after announcing that data for its lead HBV core inhibitor candidates, ABI-H0731 and ABI-H2158, for the treatment of chronic HBV will be featured in a late-breaking poster session during the AASLD Annual Meeting in November. At six-month highs.LLNW (3.88 +24.2%): Reported in-line Q3 EPS on upside revs (+4.1% yr/yr to $51.32 mln, or +12% sequentially) and reaffirmed its FY19 EPS and revs guidance. Co noted that it set a new record for traffic during the quarter, exceeding the previous record by approx. +20%. It credits accelerated investments in infrastructure, significant growth in capacity, and fiscal discipline for the quarter's results and notes that it expects Q4 to see yr/yr acceleration in revenue growth as well as improvements in gross margin and overall profitability. At 11-month highs. ENDP (4.93 +18.39%): Continued strength for co and various other drug manufacturers amid reported opioid settlement talks. At four-month highs.Small Cap LosersSYRS (6.85 -32.18%): Announced that it will discontinue further development of SY-1365, its intravenous CDK7 inhibitor, as it turns to prioritizing the development of oral CDK7 inhibitor SY-5609, for which it expects to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with select solid tumors in the first quarter of 2020. Co notes that SY-5609 demonstrated greater anti-tumor activity than did SY-1365 in multiple preclinical models and that SY-1365 "did not support an optimal profile for patients" in initial data from the expansion of the Phase 1 trial of SY-1365. Co identifies SY-5609 as the more selective and more potent CDK7 inhibitor and believes that it has "best-in-class potential." At three-month lows.XOG (2.28 -9.36%): Downgraded to Underperform from Outperform and price target cut to $2 from $7 at Imperial Capital, citing expectations for flat Q3 production levels, owing to unplanned outages in co's Western Gas system and startup delays for the Rimrock system, and noting fundamental riskiness in co's business model relative to DJ Basin peers, among other factors. At new all-time lows. ZIOP (3.84 -4.36%): Sees continued weakness; the stock slid lower yesterday afternoon following a cautious mention at Alpha Exposure. The stock today trades at its new lowest levels since March.12:04SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (104) outpacing new lows (21) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAN, ACM, AIV, AMAT, AMKR, ATKR, AVB, AYR, BHE, BLD, BLDR, BMCH, BRX, BZH, CCK, CCMP, CCS, CELG, CETV, CHCT, CHTR, CNS, COLD, CPB, CROX, CSTM, DCOM, DEA, DHI, DLR, DLTR, DOV, ENTG, EPRT, ETR, FBHS, FCN, FORM, FSP, GLIBA, GNRC, GWR, HCP, HD, HTA, HTLD, IBP, INFO, INVH, INXN, IRT, KBH, KLAC, KMX, KN, KOD, KRNT, KSU, LBRDK, LEN, LGIH, LTC, LULU, MAA, MAS, MCK, MDC, MDCO, MHO, MTH, MTZ, NFBK, NKE, NSA, O, ODFL, OHI, PFSI, PHM, PLD, PLMR, PLUG, POOL, RETA, REXR, RH, RLI, ROST, SHW, SJW, SNX, TGT, THG, TJX, TMHC, TPH, TRNO, UDR, VFC, WGO, WLH, WMS, WTR, WUStocks that traded to 52 week lows: CAAP, CBS, CJ, CRC, CRWD, ENLC, FIXX, FTSI, GTLS, GTYH, HEP, LGF.A, MTDR, PBT, PK, SCPL, SLCA, SM, TEUM, VIAB, XOGThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: BRT, IRET, NVMIThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: FULC, KLDO, MIRM, RMNIETFs that traded to 52 week highs: EWN, EWT, IOO, ITB, PSK, RTH, XHBETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX11:54AXP American Express Earnings Preview- Investors look for strong consumer to offset commercial weakness (118.13 +0.72)American Express (AXP) is set to report Q3 results tomorrow before the market opens with a conference call to follow at 8:30am ET.Current Capital IQ stands at EPS of $2.02 on Revenue of $10.9 bln.9/23- Increased dividend to $0.43 from $0.39 and announced a new 120 mln share repurchase.FY19 EPS Outlook in the $7.85-8.35 range. At the Barclays conference on September 10, AXP laid out the reasoning behind its wider than usual range for EPS guidance. That was due to the uncertainty in the economic environment. Comments at Barclays suggested AXP would see the middle of that range. So analysts are expecting company to tighten the outlook. The midpoint will be key with current Capital IQ consensus sitting at $8.10. The primary weakness for AXP is around its commercial end which makes up 42% of the business. The consumer remains strong.FY19 Revenue Growth in the range of 8-10%. AXP has reaffirmed this number the past two quarters despite only posting growth of 6.6% in Q1 and 8.4% in Q2. This has investors looking at the company either posting a back end loaded revenue number, which may be difficult given the slow down in commercial, or for AXP to lower the high end of this estimate.Q2 RecapReported Q2 (Jun) earnings of $2.07 per share, $0.05 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.02. Revenues rose 8.4% year/year to $10.84 bln vs the $10.82 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Consolidated provisions for losses were $861 million, up 7 percent from $806 million a year ago. The increase reflected higher net lending write-offs driven by loan growth. Consolidated expenses were $7.8 billion, up 9 percent from $7.1 billion a year ago. The rise reflected, in part, growth in rewards and other customer engagement costs driven by increased Card Member spending, higher usage of card benefits and continued investments in cobrand partnerships. Operating expenses were up 7 percent from a year ago.Co reaffirmed guidance for FY19, sees EPS of $7.85-8.35 vs. $8.09 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The laggard of note is the information technology sector (-0.3%), which is being weighed down by the response to IBM's (IBM 134.26, -7.85, -5.5%) relatively disappointing earnings report.The health care sector is benefiting from news of a potential opioid settlement being in the works, which is leading to outsized gains for drug distributor stocks like McKesson (MCK 150.20, +5.36, +3.7%), Cardinal Health (CAH 51.15, +2.08, +4.2%), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 89.36, +3.31, +3.9%).

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed. It hasn't had a more pronounced impact, though, for several reasons:The U.S. market has never been fully bothered by the idea of a disorderly Brexit, content it seems to see it as more of an issue for the UK and the EU.There is ample doubt still that it will win approval in Parliament.The relatively subdued response in the UK's FTSE 100 (+0.5%) and in the British pound (+0.2% against the dollar) suggests there is reason to keep enthusiasm in check at the moment.08:04BYSI BeyondSpring: US Patent Office has granted the Company a new patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,357,491 B2, for methods of treating a brain tumor by administering Plinabulin (18.30 )The patent, which expires in 2036, covers methods for Plinabulin's use in the treatment of brain tumors, including metastatic brain tumor, with no approved chemotherapy on the market, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common adult brain tumor.

In August 2019, PM Izhora submitted its objections disagreeing with MTI's allegations set forth in the initial assessment and MTI's methodology for calculating the alleged underpayments. MTI accepted some of PM Izhora's arguments and in September 2019, issued the final tax assessment claiming an underpayment of RUB 24.3 billion (approximately $374 million) including penalties and interest.

With the positive momentum we continue to see in our Towers and Fiber segments, we remain focused on investing in our business to generate future growth while delivering dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year."16:22UMPQ Umpqua Holdings beats by $0.01 (15.97 -0.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.38 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.37.Net interest income increased by $1.8 million on a quarter to quarter basis primarily driven by higher average balances of loans and leases along with a lower level of premium amortization for residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, partially offset by lower average yields on loans and leases;Net interest margin was 3.63% for the third quarter of 2019, down seven basis points from 3.70% for the second quarter of 2019 primarily driven by the decrease in short-term interest rates during the quarter.16:20AA Alcoa misses by $0.16, reports revs in-line; announces multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs; intends to pursue non-core asset sales (19.16 -0.29)Reports Q3 (Sep) loss of $(0.44) per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.16 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.28); revenues fell 24.3% year/year to $2.57 bln vs the $2.58 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co reports Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $388 mln vs consensus of $369 mln. This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability. Over the next 12-18 months, Alcoa intends to pursue non-core asset sales expected to generate an estimated $500 mln to $1 bln in net proceeds. Co estimates approx $50-100 mln in reduced adjusted EBITDA due to such asset sales. Over the next five years, Alcoa plans to realign its operating portfolio, and has placed under review 1.5 mln metric tons of smelting capacity and 4 mln metric tons of alumina refining capacity. The review will consider opportunities for significant improvement, potential curtailments, closures or divestitures.Alcoa refines strategic priorities, co has updated Strengthen the Balance Sheet to Advance Sustainably. This priority encompasses both financial sustainability through balance sheet improvements and portfolio transformation.For full-year 2019, Alcoa continues to project a global aluminum deficit, ranging between 800 thousand and 1.2 million metric tons, down slightly from the previous quarter's estimate of a deficit between 1.0 million and 1.4 million metric tons.16:19CNXM CNX Midstream Partners increases quarterly cash distribution to $0.4001/unit from $0.3865/unit (12.98 -0.05)16:19EGBN Eagle Bancorp beats by $0.01, beats on revs (42.62 0.00)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.07 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.06; revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $87.3 mln vs the $81.08 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.The net interest margin ("NIM") in the third quarter of 2019 was 3.72% as compared to 3.91% in the second quarter of 2019 and 4.14% for the third quarter of 2018.Net interest income decreased less than 1% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 from the same period in 2018 ($81.0 million versus $81.3 million), resulting from compressed margins associated with increased costs of funds and lower loan yields due in part to enhanced competitive pressure more than offsetting growth in average earning assets of 11%.16:19URI United Rentals beats by $0.19, beats on revs; narrows FY19 revs guidance, still inline (121.71 +0.99)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $5.96 per share, $0.19 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $5.77; revenues rose 17.6% year/year to $2.49 bln vs the $2.46 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter. Crude oil production is expected to account for approx. 66% of the company's production during the quarter, while natural gas and NGLs are expected to account for approx. 18% and 16%, respectively. During September, Carrizo took advantage of the rally in commodity prices to add to its 2020 hedge position.16:10TBK Triumph Bancorp reports EPS in-line, net interest income increased 2% (31.29 +0.14)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.56 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.56.Net interest income for the quarter was $64.8 mln compared to $63.4 mln for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.

Adjusted EBITDA is currently estimated to be approximately 3 percent below budget, primarily due to the delay in Elba's in-service date, lower commodity prices and volumes impacting the CO2 segment, and the impact of 501-G settlements, partially offset by the strong performance of the West Region Natural Gas16:06CGNX Cognex acquires industrial machine vision software developer SUALAB (48.88 -0.26)SUALAB is a Korean-based developer of vision software using deep learning for industrial applications.

Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is jobs Friday, October 4th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Jobs in America, we are all waiting on the September jobs' report, it is out in 30 minutes' time, it may very well be a market mover. Economists are expecting 145,000 jobs created, in the month of September, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent.Now, this jobs' report today, takes on more importance after some real underwhelming data this entire week. The following -- the numbers follow the weaker-than-expected data on manufacturing, on the ADP numbers, on the ISM factory use, all of that, this week, below estimates. We will have the numbers, and we will see if that weakness is translating into pullback in jobs, coming up.Ahead of the numbers, markets right now, are lower. Dow Industrials down 69 points on the Futures right now, Futures for the S&P down 10 and NASDAQ Futures right now, down 19, that's a quarter of a percent lower on all the major averages.Turmoil this morning, once again, in Hong Kong. Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, taking emergency measures now. She says she is banning face masks at public gatherings. This, of course, coming from China. The move aim to stem protests, but doing just the opposite, sparking fresh demonstrations.Of course, China has facial recognition cameras all over the place, so they want to see who is active protests, and so you take your masks off, you're unmasked to the Chinese government.All those stories coming up this Friday morning, and joining me to break it all down, FOX Business' Dagen McDowell, Moody's Capital Markets chief economist, John Lonski, and the assistant editorial page editor at the Wall Street Journal, James Freeman. Big stories today, guys.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I would say the Carrie Lam in Hong Kong is moving in the wrong direction, if she is moving toward more surveillance, fewer liberties for protesters, et cetera, I think they're waiting to hear how she is going to act to preserve Hong Kong's traditional liberties.BARTIROMO: Yes. And, you know, this week, somebody got shot. This poor man got shot in the chest, and then they turned it on, and said oh, he attacked the cops first. Things are turning really violent in Hong Kong now.JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: Yes, I think so. Now, this reminds us that those -- an important political dimension to this trade dispute with China. There's no denying that, there's no getting away from it, no, it's linked to cybersecurity, intellectual property theft and so on.BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see the next big date to look at, after Golden Week ends, which is, of course, the celebration of 70 years of Communist rule, is October 10th. October 10th, U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Washington, we'll see if anything gets done, as these fires burn in Hong Kong.Meanwhile, our top story this morning is the jobs number. It is jobs Friday. The September jobs' report out in about 25 minutes. Economists are predicting 145,000 jobs were added to the economy last month, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent.This is on the heels of a wild week for the markets, the Dow tumbled better than 800 points in the first two days of the fourth quarter this week. Markets on pace now for the worst week since August 2nd, what are you expecting, what are you looking for, what's most important from this jobs number?LONSKI: I think, given the slowdown on business sales, the shrinkage of profitability, we might be lucky to get 125,000 new jobs for the month of September, not too optimistic about what's going to happen on the employment front, until we see some conclusive evidence of an upturn by the growth of business sales and an improvement in profitability.BARTIROMO: Well, you're way below the estimate. That's what J.P. Morgan is, 125,000, the overall estimates, 145,000. What's most important to you this morning, Dagen?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: The overall number, 150,000 is the average for June, July and August, so if you come pretty close to that number, it's a good sign. We only need 100,000 new jobs, a month, to sustain a healthy labor market. So, that's, kind of, the bottom end of what you would want to see.Also, look -- watch the weekly work figures, because annual growth in average weekly earnings has trended down, it peeked last year at 3.6 percent. You've seen a loss of momentum there because people are working fewer hours. It's the fewer hours work that is troubling because, again, businesses tend to start reducing hours before they really cut back in jobs.LONSKI: All this equity market volatility is not encouraging companies to take on new workers.FREEMAN: Yes, we've had some bad economic news this week, but the story to this point on the job market has been employers not being able to find as many workers as they want to hire. So, I think that's going to be interesting, looking at the different industries in this report, but also, are there people coming back into the labor market.Do we see a bigger labor force more participation in this report? Because while we've gotten some soft signals on manufacturing, on services, stock market looking forward, hasn't been quite as optimistic, all the labor market data, to this point, is that it's a workers' market.There are lots of jobs, employers are trying to find people to fill them. And it'll be interesting to see if more of those people decided to join the labor force this month.BARTIROMO: Or the opposite.FREEMAN: Or opposite.BARTIROMO: If you see a pullback, given the weak data that we've seen. Look, I want to see what this number means for the Federal Reserve, right? I mean, we are expecting another cut in rates, this year. Does it happen in October, does it happen in December? We'll see what this number says.MCDOWELL: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter to the market. Does that ultimately -- does that pull more people into jobs that are open? Do those jobs never even get filled? Because a lot -- kind of one of the broad messages that you hear from economists is, because we have seen this big drop in, say mortgage rates, that the refinancing boom will cause the economy to bump back up, starting in 2020.There's a lot of hope being pinned on that. That that money will flow back into the economy and lift what has been, again, softness, not just in manufacturing but in services, and even some softness in consumption for the most recent month.BARTIROMO: I just want to point out the Boeing situation and the G.M. strike were big issues as far as manufacturing, so I'm not looking at the manufacturing numbers this week, as totally cut and dry, because of the Boeing pullback.MCDOWELL: But ISM contracted in August, as well, the Manufacturing Index, and we have seen a big slowdown. We've talked about on this program, month after month, a slowdown in job creation, in manufacturing. And we should point out, 4,000 jobs are the expectation on manufacturing.This is going to be critical to watch. It was 3,000 in the month of August. So, again, stability there, is important, given the news we got this week.BARTIROMO: I also want to see the retail numbers. Let's see what retail does, given the strength of the consumer, so far. What do you want to say, John?LONSKI: Yes, I want to say, you know, let's not forget that the ISM Manufacturing Index contracted for five consecutive months, 2015 and 2016. We had a profit's recession. Fortunately, that profit's recession was contained, didn't spread to the overall economy. Perhaps, we'll have a repeat of that, this year.MCDOWELL: But policy does matter and trade policy, and that's why this meeting with the Chinese officials is going to be so critical because the White House and the government are in a situation, where they can't make any mistakes.BARTIROMO: Yes.LONSKI: And I might want to add that the average federal funds rate in 2016, was 0.4 percent, we're still at 1.88 percent, so it behooves the Fed to cut rates come October 30th, at least by 25 basis --FREEMAN: But as Dagen is pointing out, the problem is not that rates are too high, the problem is, people are concerned about trade.LONSKI: I --FREEMAN: So, I --LONSKI: Yes.FREEMAN: I'm not saying they won't cut, but I think they're going to find, continually, here that's not the solution to the problem.BARTIROMO: Right.FREEMAN: The solution is trade peace that encourages people to start investing again.BARTIROMO: Right. That's what Dagen is saying. It won't even matter. Yes.LONSKI: You know, what's scary about trade, we had somebody on earlier, talking about the Airbus complaint. That was filed in 2004, it got resolved, 15 years later, 2019. This trade disputes can go on for an extended period of time.BARTIROMO: Let me -- let me ask you before we -- before we continue the jobs discussion, because we've got a lot of that coming up into the 8:30 number.Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO, has a net worth of $62 billion, he's speaking out against the billionaire wealth comment that Bernie Sanders made. Listen to this employee Q&A yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I don't know if I have like an exact threshold, on like -- on what amount of money someone should have. But look, I mean, at some level, no one deserves to have that much money. I think if you do something that's good, you get rewarded, but, I do think some of these -- some of the wealth that can be accumulated is unreasonable.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So, this was -- this was in response to Bernie Sanders' comment that there should be no billionaires in America. It's just not right. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff claims capitalism is dead. He told the panel in San Francisco, it is not just about making money, it has to be more than that. Benioff worth $6.2 billion himself.And then, of course, this is on top of the business roundtable, decision, to come out and say look, we are not going to put profits first, we want to put our communities and employees first, James Freeman.FREEMAN: Yes, it would be nice if we could rely on CEOs and big companies, on people who have made fortunes in America with our free market system, to defend it, but sadly, we can't. So, we hear a lot of political mealy- mouthed stuff from them, like you just heard from Zuckerberg.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: And the fact is, what the Bernie plan is going to do, it's going to take a little bit of Zuck's pile every year, but what it's going to do most of all, is encourage the next Zuckerbergs to locate somewhere else.MCDOWELL: Exactly.FREEMAN: Because it's their -- his -- Bernie sets up a 60 percent exit tax, if Zuck wanted to leave with his money, so that's going to be a pretty big barrier, but the message to every person starting a new tech company is, you do not want to be based in the United States, because if you hit the home run by giving great products we all enjoy, it's going to be plundered.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: And this is -- we're talking --BARTIROMO: You're pushing money out of America. There's a rise of billionaires in China, you know? I mean, that's -- is that what we want? All the billionaires are in China, not in America?MCDOWELL: All these other countries, France, for example, they got rid of its wealth tax. Russia, they're going to open their doors to American innovation, if something like this goes through. But, by the way, I think this is unconstitutional exit taxes.FREEMAN: It is.MCDOWELL: Never is against the constitution, so --BARTIROMO: As we've said, it's confiscation.MCDOWELL: Right.LONSKI: Many 401(k) plans remind us, you don't have to be rich to be hurt by a wealth tax.BARTIROMO: That's true.LONSKI: You're going to find that out.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point. I've been asking the question, what is rich? Is $250,000, rich? Is that -- is that the top level? That's going to hurt a lot of people.LONSKI: About right.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll take a short break. When we come back, we have special coverage this morning, of the September jobs report, the entire hour, with the official numbers coming out, in about 15 minutes. Stay with us. We're checking out if there's a market impact.And then, an act of patriotism, one Nevada Highway Patrol trooper stopping on the side of a highway, out of respect for a fallen American flag. We'll show you, next. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Hong Kong's government taking a harder line against prodemocracy protesters now. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right, Maria, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam is banning protesters from wearing face masks at public gatherings. Violators face a fine of more than $3,000 U.S. and up to one year in jail. The emergency order coming four months after demonstrations began over an extradition bill that's now been withdrawn.Well, shares of General Electric are lower in the premarket, down 1-1/4 percent. This is after J.P. Morgan analysts said that G.E.'s Aviation unit isn't worth as much as Wall Street wolves estimate it is. The analyst said, quote, "We believe there is justification for materially lower equity value and see a business that is closer to its best days being behind it than in front." All right.And then, there is this, a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper is being held a hero for saving an American flag. The trooper was driving on Highway 15 in Las Vegas when he spotted the flag on the side of the road. Well, the Air Force veteran hops out of his patrol car, picks it up, as you can see there. He brought the flag to a local American Legion post, where it's going to receive a proper retirement ceremony. But you know, seeing the flag just upset him so much, he had to go and get it. I need it.BARTIROMO: That is beautiful. I like that. Cheryl, thank you. Coming up, we are just a few minutes away from the September jobs report. We'll slip in a short break and then what you need to know ahead of the jobs number where the markets are down 74 points, S&P down 10, and the NASDAQ down 21 before the September jobs report. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The September jobs report due out in just a few minutes. Economists are expecting 145,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of September, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent. Joining us right now, all hands on deck chief workforce analysts at Employbridge Joanie Courtney is here, along with the Wall Street Journal senior writer Jon Hilsenrath is here; former Wall Street Journal editorial board member and the co-author of Trumponomics, Stephen Moore, joining us, along with U.S. Bank Wealth Management, Senior Vice President and head of Traditional Investments Group, Lisa Erickson.Great to see, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Lisa Erickson, kick us off here. Are you -- are your expectations right there with the other economists out there at 145,000? What do you want to see today?LISA ERICKSON, SENIOR VP, U.S. BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT: We are. We're expecting a jobs report very much in line with the recent few prior reports of the last few months, basically expecting to see some nice payroll numbers even though it's going to be slowing a little bit from prior gains. And then, on the wage side, we're expecting to see some very reasonable and healthy increases in wages but not at excessive levels.BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath, how important is this report to the Federal Reserve? And what are you expecting in terms of the rest of the year and rate cuts?JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: I think this report is very important to the Federal Reserve and I think it's very important for everybody because you know, the job market is what's keeping the consumer strong right now if the -- if job growth slows, it could affect consumer spending, which slows the whole economy so I think the Fed will be worth watching it very carefully. And you know, a lot of the momentum seems to be slowing which suggests we'll get at least one more rate cut this year.BARTIROMO: All right, everybody Stay where you are. We want to slip in a short break, and then we get the September jobs report right after this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. We have breaking news this morning, the September jobs report is due out in three minutes' time. Economists are expecting 145,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of September. They're expecting the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7 percent. This follows weaker than expected data this week on the economy and manufacturing, as well as the ADP report. Ahead of the numbers, Futures right now are trading down. Take a look, Dow Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading of 74 points. S&P is down 10 and the NASDAQ down 21. We have all hands on deck this morning to identify where the jobs are in this economy. And are we seeing this week manufacturing data start to show off in jobs. Stephen Moore is with us right now. Let me get your final thoughts before we get this number, Stephen, what's most important?STEPHEN MOORE, FORMER EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: I'll be looking, Maria, at those blue collar jobs. What's happened with mining, manufacturing and construction? Those are the ones that show -- are showing a lot of weakness. The other thing I'll be looking at is what's happened with wages and salaries. That consumers really been carrying the economy over the last three or four months because of big wage gains. Let's see if that continues.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, wage growth has been something that has been a positive in this slow down --MOORE: Huge. Huge, yes.BARTIROMO: -- up three plus percent. Joanie Courtney, where are the jobs right now?JOANIE COURTNEY, CHIEF WORKFORCE ANALYST, EMPLOYBRIDGE: Maria, you know, the job market has actually never been stronger. Like if you look at today, there's over 7 million open jobs in all sectors. The challenge still is on the supply side, you know, side. We have an extreme labor shortage. And there's other factors, of course, you know, with trade and, you know, employers being cautious, but we do see that the demand is very strong. There is probably some softness in manufacturing, and retail.BARTIROMO: Yes.COURTNEY: But trade, logistics, transportation, the professional and business service sector, and health care, they're all thriving and adding a lot of jobs and having a hard time finding talent.BARTIROMO: Yes.COURTNEY: So, I think we will see wages move again in in this job report.BARTIROMO: And you think they'll move up, you're saying?COURTNEY: I think they're going to move up. We're seeing -- I mean, this report will show what's the average hourly worker. I know we see it with our customers. We work a lot in supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, and the wages are moving up still month over month.BARTIROMO: Well, we're talking about manufacturing all the time, Dagen, and the slow down there, but it was the services index yesterday that also showed weakness. This is a services economy, it's not really something you want to see.MCDOWELL: Right? Absolutely. So, we'll be looking at all the different industries and this report but also the unemployment rate, the downward momentum and the unemployment rate seems to have ended. But if we have it staying stable here, it's a sign that, again, there aren't layoffs happening.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, so far, it looks like it's a pullback in hiring, not necessarily layoffs. Is that what you think as well, John Lonski?LONSKI: I hope that remains the case. I would become very worried if we began to see a rise by the unemployment rate in the past that indicated an impending recession.BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll watch that. OK. Again, the estimates call for 145,000 jobs to have been added to the economy in the month of September with the unemployment rate --LONSKI: Impending session.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. We'll watch that. OK. Again, the estimates call for 145,000 jobs to have been added to the economy the month of September with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent. The number is about to come out. Let's get to Edward Lawrence. He's at the Labor Department with the number.EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, 136,000 jobs is what this economy created, 114,000 in the private sector, 22,000 in the government public sector there. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5 percent. The last time it was that low was when we landed on the moon, 1969, in that year.Revisions were both up for July and August, 7,000 jobs added in July, revised up in August, 38,000 jobs for net revision of up 45,000 jobs. The U-6 is 6.9 percent, the long-term unemployment was little changed, still at 22.7 percent of unemployed. Average hourly wages, no change month-to- month, that brings the last 12 months down to 2.9 percent increase in wages. Labor force participation rate unchanged, 63.2 percent, the average hourly workweek also unchanged, nonsupervisory wages did grow $0.04, that's a 0.2 percent increase month-over-month.White unemployment rate at 3.2 percent, black unemployment rate tied the historic low, 5.5 percent, Hispanic unemployment rate reached the low of all time keeping stats back in 1973, 3.9 percent. Asian unemployment rate, 2.5 percent.Now of the job sector's healthcare, adding 39,000 jobs, manufacturing losing 2,000 jobs, mining losing a hundred jobs, and retail eight months in a row declines 11,000 jobs down to construction, adding 7,000 jobs. It's interesting the sector of transportation and warehouse added 15,700 jobs.The bottom line here, unemployment rate dropped to a historic low with 3.5 percent, and we added 136,000 jobs. Maria.LAWRENCE: Wow. Yes. I mean, it is a little lower than estimates, but to me, my first instinct, this is not a bad number. Let's get your reaction. James Freeman.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, especially with those upward revisions from previous months, this is -- this is pretty strong, unemployment rate comes down. Wages, I would like to see a little higher, but this is still faster than inflation. So, generally good news for workers, and I think to Joanie's point earlier, this is still a very health labor market. Good time to be looking for a job.BARTIROMO: Market has completely reversed course. John Lonski, Dow Industrials now up 48 points. It had been lower earlier.JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKET: Why not move higher in the market side? Because we had this decline by the unemployment rate. As I mentioned earlier, each previous recession going back for years, was preceded by an upturn by the unemployment rate and that's not happening. You're just moving in the opposite direction. Good news.BARTIROMO: Yes. Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, not good news for manufacturing where you had 2,000 jobs lost there that could to reinforce the fears of what is going on in manufacturing. I know, I know, I know, it's not that large a part of the economy, but it's a critical one with a multiplier effect in good production.So, again, maybe this bounce back in the stock market futures at this point are related to the Federal Reserve. This is weak enough that you get more aggressive Fed cuts.FREEMAN: Well, I --MCDOWELL: Let's move on.FREEMAN: I just -- I think it should be noted, we've talked a lot about that ISM report --BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: -- on manufacturing which was not good. The Markit PMI was more positive. So I think we're still in a -- in a -- in a muddling through. It's not clear that we're really declining in manufacturing.MCDOWELL: That gauge is not as old as the ISM manufacturing gauge.FREEMAN: That's true. That's true. But --MCDOWELL: That's why we don't pay as -- pay as close of attention to it.FREEMAN: You can.BARTIROMO: Edward Lawrence --LAWRENCE: Maria, can I just add --BARTIROMO: Yes. Go ahead, Edward Lawrence has one more nugget on the Fed, let's get to him, and then I want to hear your commentary, Jon Hilsenrath. Edward.LAWRENCE: Yes, Maria. The Federal Reserve is looking at those average hourly wages, this is, again, downward pressure on the inflation. It does not look like inflation is sort of taking off in this market here and that's something the Federal Reserve watches also. The labor force participation rate, so this may signal that rate cut more likely coming up at the next meeting.BARTIROMO: Do you agree with that, Jon Hilsenrath, what's your reaction?JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, I think a rate cut in October is in play. I don't think it's a done deal, you know, I think the Fed is reluctant to move very aggressively right now. I mean I think what it's looking at is after today's report, basically an affirmation of the slowdown story, and a contradiction of the recession story, so job growth has slowed, we're not near the 200 a month numbers where at a year ago, it's down below 150,000.The economy is slowing, it's affected wages, but there's nothing in here that points to recession, and there's been a lot of worry about recession in markets and I think that is why we're going to see, you know why we're seeing stock prices rebound.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean I don't think --HILSENRATH: Maybe a Fed --BARTIROMO: This range was so wide in terms of the estimates, you know, 125,000 all the way up to 180,000 something you said earlier, Dagen, but 136,000 is not so far away from the estimate. You're still looking at job growth. And once again, it does indicate that it's not necessarily firings, but a slowdown in hiring.LONSKI: That's correct. And let's not forget that we're -- this recovery is more than 10 years old and it becomes increasingly difficult --BARTIROMO: Good point.LONSKI: -- to increase payrolls by 200, 250,000 jobs per month, if only because you're running out of readily available qualified people.BARTIROMO: Yes. Lisa Erickson, what do you make of this reaction here? Markets are rallying big time. We had been down about 50 points before the number. Dow Industrials now up 74 points, NASDAQ up 30.LISA ERICKSON, VICE PRESIDENT, U.S. BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Yes. I think from a market perspective, this report is really just what the doctor ordered. What you see is that you got some counter to the slowing growth fears because the jobs number, again, was solid. Again, slower than prior year but not unexpected given the stage of the cycle.And on the other hand, you had wage growth that was actually moderate below expectations so that allows the Fed to, again, look at one, potentially two additional cuts later this year. So, overall, I think a really nice report.I am curious though about the wage growth number. It is somewhat low and you would expect to be a little higher if underlying demand indicators were higher. But we'll continue to watch that number.BARTIROMO: Yes. What about that U.S. September average hourly earnings, all private workers unchanged. The consensus was up three-tenths of a percent, so that's obviously a disappointment there.MCDOWELL: The year-over-year, with it being at 2.9 percent, that's what I think James brought up, 2.9 percent going back below that three percent market, still faster than inflation. But that softness there is a worry.And in terms of the manufacturing, to be fair, you have to factor in the G.M. strike and what's going on with Boeing.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: I don't -- I forget when the G.M. strike started, but this survey would have been done in the middle of last month, so we will -- the report that they put out will probably dig into details of that.FREEMAN: Yes. That range issue, I think it really is a puzzle right now. The -- you looked at that NFIB report yesterday on small business and you see employers raising compensation to attract workers. We're still seeing a very tight labor market and why it's not even better news in terms of wages, I think, is a puzzle people are going to be working on.LONSKI: Let's not forget, we're looking at an average in wage growth, and I can't help but note that I think right now, the percent of employment that's at least 55 years of age, is at a record high, nearly 24 percent. And as it turns out, older employers, these very much older employers, tend to get smaller increases. And as you skew employment towards older workers, you're naturally going to get slower wage growth.BARTIROMO: Yes. But, hey, let's just --LONSKI: It helps (INAUDIBLE) inflation.BARTIROMO: Let's point out that August is being revised upward.LONSKI: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: So good news for the August revision there. Joanie Courtney and Steve Moore, got to get your reaction to all of this. Joanie, go.JOANIE COURTNEY, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, EMPLOYBRIDGE: Yes, you know, Maria, I have to say, what we're seeing on the frontlines with wages is a lot more upward movement, and employers right now are being forced to be competitive, and pay more to the average -- I mean to the hourly worker. They have to. They're having a hard time getting their jobs filled. And I think that's why we're actually not seeing a stronger headline number.I mean look at unemployment being down to 3-1/2 percent, so I'm surprised it didn't show up in the report. I will tell you, we are seeing movement in wages more on the frontlines. I expect that trend to only continue because there's not available talent to meet the demands that are out there.BARTIROMO: Yes.COURTNEY: So that is a little bit of a mystery, I think, in this report. But, again, it speaks to the strong job market. I think manufacturing is another story. Certainly, there's softness in manufacturing. We have to, you know, get back, focused on creating manufacturing jobs in America.BARTIROMO: Yes,COURTNEY: I love that you had employers on this morning and they all said, you know, they're hiring. So it really --BARTIROMO: Yes. By the way, one of the --COURTNEY: -- is something --BARTIROMO: One of those entrepreneurs, the first thing she said was in terms of her expenses that we have to keep raising wages, and, you know, she said we want to.COURTNEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: But this is -- this is what we face in America, higher wages.(CROSSTALK)COURTNEY: And that's the challenge they have.BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly.LONSKI: I just want to add that if you look at the U.S. government's aggregate estimates for profitability, what's been squeezing profitability has been faster the growth of employee compensation. It's growing faster now than what they call corporate debt revenues.BARTIROMO: Yes. Steve Moore, jump in here.STEPHEN MOORE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: So, look, the headline here is for four months, all we've been hearing is recession. There is no recession. Let's be very clear about that. We've had really strong, you know, what I believe is very strong job growth given where we are in this recovery, given the fact that literally employers are running out of workers.And by the way, these wage numbers, you know. I was just reporting on the census wage and salary numbers, they're showing gigantic increases in people's incomes in both July and August, I mean huge increases and that explains why people are going out and spending.Look, this is -- we keep hearing the story of recession and yet there's never sign of it except for the weak manufacturing numbers, but people's incomes are high, they've got plenty of jobs. And I agree with what, you know, others were saying. This is the single best job market for a worker in any of our lifetimes. And anybody can find a job with any skill in 48 hours.BARTIROMO: Markets are coming off of the highs, but we're still in positive territory, still showing a reversal from earlier weakness. Dow Industrials now up 32 points. Dagen, what strikes you about this number?MCDOWELL: That it's good -- that's it's good enough that the economy remains stable, but it's s soft enough that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. So it is this perfect scenario, if you will.BARTIROMO: Little Goldilocks economy once again.MCDOWELL: Yes. Exactly. Btu I just want to point out something, Steve. We don't set in this set and say recession, but it's legitimate --MOORE: I know you don't. Others do, though. Yes.MCDOWELL: But it's legitimate to point out things historically that have been worrisome to investors, worrisome to the financial world like when the short-term interest rates are higher than longer-term interest rates. That's something --MOORE: Yes, but that's because the Fed is -- that's because the Fed is too tight.MCDOWELL: That's what I was going to say.MOORE: I mean the Fed could spell that in a minute.MCDOWELL: That's what I was going to say, that the --MOORE: Yes. I mean if (INAUDIBLE) has to cut rates at least one more time.MCDOWELL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Yes, and Jon Hilsenrath just said that it's -- hey, guys, let's not underestimate July and August. They were both revised upward. These are good numbers for August.MOORE: Exactly.FREEMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: A hundred sixty-eight thousand, that's up from 130,000. And July, 166,000 up from 159,000. These markets have completely reversed course. In fact, let's check on the markets with Gerri Willis. She's on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right now, getting some reaction there. Gerri, over to you.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Maria, this is fascinating. I'm going to echo a couple pf things that Steve had to say. This is being interpreted as a very good report. Coming into this report, people were increasingly negative here on the floor of the exchange. They were seeing the consensus numbers go down. So, seeing these numbers, even though 136 is not 145 -- 145,000, they didn't care. They see that as solid, and they like the revisions on August. You just mentioned them. That was very much a positive for these guys down here. That's one of the things that they watch closely.They say we are not in recession territory, that is the takeaway today and that's why you're seeing green on the screen here with the futures right now. I want to get to another piece of information, more economic data coming in. August international trade, a bigger deficit than estimated. We're not getting much market reaction because we're still focused on jobs right now.But let me tell you, this was something that the market has been very -- watching very closely, this jobs report, for a view on the economy. The news down here, positive. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Let's check in with Jon Hilsenrath here. Jon, what are you looking at?HILSENRATH: Two things I wanted to mention, one is, you know, that unemployment coming down to 3.5 percent, that could be good news or bad news. Sometimes, it comes down because people are leaving the job market. That's not what happened in this report. What we saw was a big increase in the measure of employed and a big decrease in the measure of people who were unemployed.You know, so that's a -- it's a strong underlying number, that 3.5 percent. I would also just point out that trade deficit number, getting worse. You know, we're doing so much to fix our trade position, and so far, at least it isn't working.FREEMAN: Well, it --LONSKI: Maria, could I mention one other quick thing on the -- on the -- on the --BARTIROMO: Yes, well, hold on. Hold on. We got James Freeman right here. Go ahead, James.FREEMAN: Yes. I would say it doesn't need to work. We -- it doesn't matter if we rung trade deficits. We've had -- we've had lots of great periods of growth while we had big deficits.I think the question here is why is there need for a further rate cut? I know everyone kind of expects it. This is a healthy economy. We don't see businesses demanding credit. I think the president --MCDOWELL: I can --BARTIROMO: Dagen's got the answer.FREEMAN: -- ought to say (INAUDIBLE) dollar, we have such a strong currency.BARTIROMO: Well then --MCDOWELL: Because the banking --BARTIROMO: And therein lies the issue.MCDOWELL: Well, the banking system kind of sort of doesn't work when overnight lending rate is higher than it cost -- that you would -- that you would earn on making a loan, so you borrow short and lend long, and when that's upside down, it doesn't really help the banking system.HILSENRATH: Yes. Can I just back up?FREEMAN: So there are a lot distortions that have been built into the banking system but I think it's clear that people should get a return on their lending.BARTIROMO: Yes.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You would -- you would expect that. Steve Moore, go ahead. Go ahead, Steve.MOORE: Well, look, here's what I disagree a little bit with James. There's a shortage of dollars in the world. That's the reason the Fed has to, you know, lower rates to get more dollar liquidity. You have huge demand for dollars and yet the Fed is not accommodating that. You know, growth does not cause inflation --FREEMAN: Or maybe you just need to change regulations --MOORE: -- and that's been the model the Fed's been living with.FREEMAN: -- on liquidity for example.MOORE: Well, I mean that -- there's something that -- but I want to mention one other quick thing, the U-6 number fell to 6.9 percent, that's what we oftentimes call the real unemployment rate. I remember when it was like 20 percent for the U-6 number. So, that means that's including people, you know, have part-time jobs that can't find a full-time job, or people that just become discouraged.What this is telling us again over and over again is that workers are -- have all the bargaining power right now because literally employers cannot find the workers to fill these jobs, and you see that U-6 number and it's just a beautiful picture, especially with those revisions. I think Wall Street's going to be very happy about the direction of the economy.BARTIROMO: Yes. Just ask General Motors. Lisa Erickson, jump in here.ERICKSON: Yes, no, again, I think this is a really nice report. Obviously we've all been watching some of the data trends, and while I would agree with the group here that we aren't seeing signs of imminent recession, certainly there has been a slowing trend.So, to get this reinforcing number, not only with this most recent month but also with the revisions, I think it's very encouraging.BARTIROMO: And the Federal Reserve, are you expecting to cut this month?ERICKSON: We are expecting one more cut before year-in, whether it's October or December. I think this particular report actually increases the odds that will come sooner rather than later, particularly with the wage growth still at still at reasonable levels, but actually not at consensus levels.BARTIROMO: Interesting reaction from the markets this morning, you know. We were down, we were up. Now we are coming off the highs. When you look at the job creation within sectors, also important to point out that manufacturing jobs did decline, although you did have the services sector looking real strong. Services producing up 109,000.FREEMAN: And the 7,000 in construction, given how hard it has been --BARTIROMO: Good point.FREEMAN: -- for people in that industry to find workers, I think it's actually encouraging even though that's not it would consider as some blowout number.LONSKI: Yes. It --BARTIROMO: I'm wondering about this retail number though, John.LONSKI: Well, we --BARTIROMO: Down 11.4 thousand.LONSKI: What are we -- you know, movement away from bricks and mortars while retail employment went down, I believe warehouse employment went higher, was up significantly so it could be that as far as consumer spending related jobs are concerned, there's a movement away from retailing to the warehousing area that represents e-commerce.BARTIROMO: I didn't see healthcare on that - on that screen, but healthcare jobs were up.MCDOWELL: Yes, they're up 39,000 jobs.HILSENRATH: Yes.LONSKI: They're going to keep going higher indefinitely.COURTNEY: And, Maria --BARTIROMO: Go ahead, Joanie.COURTNEY: I'm sorry. If I could jump in for a second, I want to say what we are seeing is definitely the movement in retail over to the warehousing, trade, and transportation and one thing that is a very positive indicator is we are gearing up certainly for peak season with the holidays and we are seeing that there's more of a demand this year than over last year for workers.And employers are also having to increase their wages to even attract the talent that they need to meet this peak season. So, there is a very strong demand. I think they are feeling that, you know, consumers are still spending. They're expecting a good, you know, Q4 and a good holiday season. They want to take advantage of that.So it is a little misleading when you see that retail number being down, but to John's point, it's because the jobs are moving. They're now in trade, logistics, warehousing, transportation. There's a very strong demand in that area right now.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a great point. I'm just -- I'm just wondering about this market reaction. Now we're looking at currencies -- the currencies versus the dollar. Obviously, the dollar has been strengthening, but John, this market is coming off of the highs. What do you make of it?LONSKI: Well, I think it's get a closer look at some of this data, which was, Jon, you were you talking -- and I --HILSENRATH: Doing Johns. Sorry.LONSKI: I would think that as the day plays out, I think the market's going to end up moving higher. This is a jobs report that very much diminishes the risk of recession.BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath, go ahead.HILSENRATH: Well, I was just going to say, you know, I think this is -- one of the reasons the market is coming off is because they're realizing the calculations for their Fed are kind of complicated right now, you know. We have a slowing economy that supports a fed rate cut, but at the same time, with an unemployment rate at 3-1/2 percent, you have to ask, why the heck should the Fed be cutting interest rates when unemployment is so low? You know, so --BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that's --HILSENRATH: -- I don't --BARTIROMO: That's exactly what James said a few minutes ago. Hey, the S&P 500 is now negative, you guys. Let me get this tweet in. The president just tweeted, here's what the president says on the jobs' report, he says, "Breaking news, unemployment rate at 3-1/2 percent drops to a 50-year low. Wow, America, let's impeach your president even though he did nothing wrong." (INAUDIBLE) the president.MCDOWELL: That's -- I'm sorry, that is brilliant messaging.MOORE: Well, they have to be -- they have to be (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: That's brilliant --MOORE: They have to be, you know, head over heels on this report.MCDOWELL: No. I was just going to -- no, it's brilliant messaging though because, again, if you're going to impeach this president, you're annulling an election and you're annulling a -- an economy that's benefited from the president's policies. Like it --BARTIROMO: Yes, but, Dagen, there's a reason --LONSKI: You know, this is a really critical point. Hold on. Yes.BARTIROMO: Wait, but there's a reason -- there's a reason we haven't heard one Democrat hopeful talk about the economy.LONSKI: Talk about the economy. Yes.BARTIROMO: Have you heard any of these --LONSKI: And by the way --BARTIROMO: -- people talk about the economy? They don't want to touch it.LONSKI: No, and --BARTIROMO: They don't want to touch it.LONSKI: What -- so wait --BARTIROMO: 50-year low unemployment. Stay away. Let's talk about the New Green Deal.MOORE: Yes. What's so interesting --LONSKI: Talk about Ukraine.BARTIROMO: Yes.MOORE: Well, look, you know, presidents don't get impeached when the economy is booming. I've said this many times on FOX Business News, Richard Nixon, while the reasons he was impeached was his economy stunk, you know, and people felt really bad about direction of the -- of the world and the economy. Bill Clinton was not impeached because the stock market was booming. Remember, Maria?FREEMAN: Impeachment (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Yes, it's the economy, stupid.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes, Bill Clinton was impeached by the House and not by the --MOORE: I know, but they didn't get rid of him.BARTIROMO: And not by the Senate.MOORE: My point is that people are going to, you know, they could put this guy in jail. If he gets these kind of numbers, he's going to get reelected.BARTIROMO: Listen, let's not --MCDOWELL: Well, but that's --BARTIROMO: -- belittle the issues here. First of all, we're talking about two different issues. Clinton was about sex, President Trump had a phone call with Ukraine and he has been framed in the last three years and he's mad as hell about it.MCDOWELL: Well -- and let's not get crazy about they could put Trump in jail and he's going to get reelected. I want to bring this up, though, with Maria. So Paul Krugman has a column.BARTIROMO: Uh-oh. Mr. Krugman.MCDOWELL: "Here comes the Trump Slump. The president has only himself to blame." That's just the headline.BARTIROMO: It's ridiculous.FREEMAN: So that's (INAUDIBLE) signal.MCDOWELL: Well, what did he say -- but what did he say on (INAUDIBLE)FREEMAN: Given the -- given the track record, that means go all in, back the truck up.MCDOWELL: What did Paul Krugman on election (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: He said --MCDOWELL: And what did you say?BARTIROMO: --when will the economy --HILSENRATH: Yes, exactly.BARTIROMO: -- go -- come back? How about never. Krugman said never the economy's going to come back. Of course I went on the air, and I said I'd be buying this market with both hands and I think this economy is going to turn around on these policies. Thank you very much. But Krugman just keeps -- maybe if he feels life if he writes it enough, people will believe it, but, hey, Paul Krugman, we got the data. We don't need to read.LONSKI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Because we have the data and we make our own decisions.MOORE: And, Maria, he's predicted eight of the last two recessions, so --BARTIROMO: Eight.LONSKI: That's why he won a Nobel Prize.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, look, this is not a bad report, 136,000. Yes, it is fractionally below what the estimates were, but having said that, things are slowing down, there's no doubt about it, that things are showing some slowdown. How severe that slowdown becomes is another question, but the Federal Reserve's right there, ready to cut.FREEMAN: Yes, we -- I think we don't -- what we really need is not the Federal Reserve cut, we need more trade resolutions like we got with Japan recently.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: So anything else that can put to rest worries about trade, I think you are going to see this economy roar.BARTIROMO: So we'll see, October 10th. What's everybody expecting from this China meeting October 10th? The U.S. and the Chinese delegations will get together in Washington.MCDOWELL: I can say with certainty that there is no certainty. I can say -- I can -- I can say with strength and vigor I have zero idea what happens.BARTIROMO: Well, look, I think both sides want a deal, Jon Hilsenrath, but, you know, there's some big ticket items here. Will the Chinese stop stealing intellectual property?HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I think with this meeting coming up, I think the -- there's a good chance that nothing happens, that they say they're going to continue to talk but there's no escalation and no resolution, so.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.HILSENRATH: As far as the Chinese stealing intellectual property, I mean what the president is trying to do is fundamentally change how they manage their economy and they're just not going to do that overnight.BARTIROMO: And then there's USMCA, John Lonski.LONSKI: Yes, well --BARTIROMO: It is -- Peter Navarro was on the show yesterday. He said if it doesn't come in the month of October, it's not coming, and if it doesn't come, it will be a disaster. Peter Navarro yesterday.LONSKI: It's going to be bad for the U.S. economy if they don't pass this thing through Congress. That's so true. So, we'll have to see what happens in that sense. Regarding China, let's not forget that China's suffering more from the trade dispute than the United States. And we talk about, you know, Chinese economy slowing down the slowest, in I don't know how many years, 25 years or something.BARTIROMO: Yes.LONSKI: But if -- the best thing China can do for its economy to get it going again is to come to some resolution regarding this trade dispute.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean --LONSKI: Forget about monetary policy, fiscal stimulus, get the trade issue out of the way.BARTIROMO: Well, that's what James and Dagen have been saying this morning. Hey, Lisa, do you have -- do you have any of these models -- are these deals in your models in terms of what you're expecting from economic growth? In other words, USMCA and China?ERICKSON: So we're really in the camp that Dagen just stated. We think that these geopolitical issues including trade policy are very difficult to forecast so really what we're just looking at to your point, Maria, is just looking at the incoming data and basing our forecasts on the slowing but growing that we're seeing in the indicators so we do feel like we're going to avoid recession, that what we're seeing right now is more of a mid-cycle slowdown. But, again, the trade policy, which is hard to predict, could tip it one way or the other.BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll see about that. Jon, I know you have to jump. Final words from you real quick.HILSENRATH: It's going to be the same as my first words, the economy does appear to be slowing, but the recession talk has been overdone.BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much, Jon Hilsenrath. It is good to see you. We are with Joanie Courtney, Lisa Erickson, as well as John Lonski and James Freeman and Dagen McDowell. Any points you guys want to make in terms of what is ahead. Hey, we are in a doorstep of third-quarter earnings. Can we get into that for a second? Because the third quarter pretty much baked in the cake that we're going to see a flat situation. Things are supposed to pick up in the fourth quarter but the guidance is going to be critical.FREEMAN: Well -- and this -- we've been saying how we'd love more wage gains for the American worker in this report. The flipside of that is maybe corporate earnings get a little boost from the fact wages not rising as quickly as we might have thought. We'll have to see, but that's potential upside on the earnings front.BARTIROMO: So where are we? We are October 5th. We're going to get the numbers within the next week. We'll start getting -- in earnest, the third quarter numbers.LONSKI: You know, I'm really struck by the slowdown in business sales that began in the summer of 2018 when the trade dispute broke out. They've slowed dramatically. We have to have some sense, some strong reason to expect, that sales growth at least is going to pick up once again. And let's not forget that for companies that have, say, more than 50 percent of their revenues from the United States, they are showing earnings growth in the second quarter. It was up five percent or so.For those with 50 percent of their revenues from outside the United States, earning's shrinking by 11 percent. So, these corporate earnings reports will give us some indication of what's going on globally and, unfortunately, the rest of the world is still lagging and that's something the Federal Reserve has to take into consideration when they meet October 30.BARTIROMO: Yes. What did Greg Ip write yesterday, Dagen, in terms of the global economy, taking down the U.S. economy? He wrote, really largely it was about the rest of the world.MCDOWELL: It is about the rest of the world, but it's also the headwinds from the trade fight that we've gotten into here, so it's kind of a double whammy. For an economy that is still growing, an old source of mine says or asked question can the Fed ease with unemployment at 3-1/2 percent. The markets still think that way --BARTIROMO: Good question.MCDOWELL: -- with the odds going from seven to one to five to one, and this was right after the report came out. This came out about -- this note came out seven minutes ago, but, again, the Fed has room to act, one, because short-term interest rates are still higher than longer term interest rates, number one, and number two because wage growth is muted at 2.9 percent back below that three percent number, that is the year-over- year average hourly earnings growth. So, yes, the Federal Reserve can move in here.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I mean it's interesting --MCDOWELL: So the down cycle's --BARTIROMO: -- because it's a good question. You're talking about a 50- year low on unemployment.LONSKI: Right. Whatever happened to the Phillips curve, you know? We were all taught, we were undergraduates.BARTIROMO: Are you going to get all wonky on us now?LONSKI: The unemployment rate goes down, wage inflation, price inflation goes up, now it's just the -- it seems to be, you know, turned on its head. The unemployment rate comes on, wage is low and inflation is low.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, the wages were unchanged. Jump in here, Stephen Moore.COURTNEY: But the --MOORE: Hey, well, look, on this wage issue, I just want to make it really clear on this, I mean the income gains that are coming out of the Census Bureau are telling exactly the opposite story, that we're seeing huge, huge increases and in wages and salaries and take-home pay of middle class workers. So, I'm not sure I can square that circle, but they're pointing in very different directions.And, by the way, the fact that consumers keep spending at this brisk pace suggests they have more money in their pockets. So I just don't actually believe this wage data. I think it's not really capturing the increase in the take-home pay of workers.COURTNEY: I agree.MCDOWELL: But I just need to add, Steve, that number from the Census Bureau that you're talking about is through July.MOORE: Yes.MCDOWELL: And so we're talking about through September --MOORE: That's -- no, it's true -- the August -- hey, Dagen, Dagen, the August numbers just came up -- out. They were up $800 per family, which is like the biggest increase in five years. So you're seeing big, big gains in income. And it's -- for some reason, it's not being reflected in this wage data.BARTIROMO: Yes. Go ahead, Joanie.MOORE: Well --BARTIROMO: Sorry.COURTNEY: Well, because this report, we have to remember, this is only the hourly worker, it's not the salaried worker.MOORE: That's true.COURTNEY: And we are seeing --MOORE: That's a good point.COURTNEY: -- that household incomes are going up. I think we are going to see it when earnings are released because it will be all the salaried workers and incentives and benefits.BARTIROMO: Yes.COURTNEY: And so that expense line is costing employers more and it is going to --BARTIROMO: Yes, don't --COURTNEY: -- impact their earnings.BARTIROMO: Don't forget about the dollar. That's going to be an issue this quarter for sure, James.FREEMAN: Yes. And whichever stats you're looking at, wages are up faster than inflation, people are highly employed. If your company's exposed to the U.S. consumer, life's pretty good.LONSKI: Economy's in pretty good shape I think right now. And who knows how long this economic recovery might last?MCDOWELL: Yes. All right. We will.BARTIROMO: Ten plus years.MCDOWELL: And before we go, Buy America. Look at the tag on the mattress, look at the tag on the clothes that you buy --MOORE: I'm in -- I'm in Indianapolis at the Buy America Conference.BARTIROMO: Right. Made in the USA. Dagen, John Lonski, James Freeman, that's Stephen Moore, Joanie Courtney, Lisa Erickson, thank you so much, everybody. Have a great weekend. "VARNEY & CO." begins right now.

HONG KONG LAWMAKERS, ACTIVISTS SLAM HAMMER ATTACK ON PEACEFUL MARCH ORGANIZERStates News ServiceOctober 16, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1544 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A key organizer of recent million-strong peaceful protests has been attacked in Hong Kong by unidentified thugs wielding hammers, as the city's chief executive Carrie Lam left the legislature amid heckling from during her annual policy address."Civil Human Rights Front convenor, Jimmy Sham, was attacked in Mong Kok Arran Lane by 4-5 people with hammers this evening at around 7:30 p.m.," the group said via its Twitter account on Wednesday."Jimmy Sham ... is now stable and taking rest in hospital," it said in a later tweet, as photos of Sham lying on the ground near a parked white car, covered in blood, began to circulate on social media.Tanya Chan, convenor of the pro-democracy camp in the Legislative Council (LegCo) said she was very angry at the attack on Sham, especially after nobody had been arrested for an earlier attack on him in August."I am shocked and angry at the attack on Jimmy, especially as, as far as I am aware, not one person has been apprehended for the attack a couple of months ago," Chan said, in reference to an attack by two masked men armed with a baseball bat and knives."Carrie Lam, are you watching? What has Hong Kong become?" she said.Long-time social activist and former lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung called on the people of Hong Kong to continue to insist on the five demands of the protest movement."There is no use being afraid," Leung told reporters outside Kwong Wah Hospital, where Sham is being treated. "Five demands, not one less."The Civil Human Rights Frontwhich has organized two protest marches of more than a million people against plans to allow extradition to mainland China in recent monthscalled on people to join a mass march on Sunday in protest at the attack.The group's spokesman Figo Chan said the attackers waved knives at people who tried to intervene, before escaping in a car."He was lying there on the ground to wait for treatment; he told me he couldn't move because his arms and legs were injured," Chan said. "There was a lot of blood.""We strongly condemn this attack, which was intended to spread political terror," he said. "We are not going to give up our fight for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong."Speech disruptedCarrie Lam entered the LegCo chamber on Wednesday to give her policy address, in an apparent bid to soothe the situation with promises of more affordable housing.But she soon cut off her speech after repeated shouts of "Five demands! Not one less!" from pro-democracy LegCo members.The protesters' five key demands are: the formal withdrawal of planned amendments to extradition laws; an amnesty for arrested protesters; an end to the description of protesters as rioters; an independent inquiry into police abuse of power; and fully democratic elections.In recent days, protesters have also begun calling for the current Hong Kong police force to be disbanded, particularly after widespread reports of the sexual abuse and torture of detainees at the hands of police.Joshua Wong, a former student leader during the 2014 pro-democracy movement, earlier hit out at a warning from Chinese President Xi Jinping that anyone trying to "split China" would meet a sticky end, saying that the ruling Chinese Communist Party is deliberately misunderstanding the protest movement."I think President Xi definitely misinterprets the actual situation in HK and dodges our calls for democracy," he wrote via his Twitter account."Hongkongers are now fighting for true and fair universal suffrage, which is the unresolved promise in Basic Law 22 years after the transfer of sovereignty," Wong said, citing a recent survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong as saying that more than 80 percent of Hong Kong's seven million population supports fully democratic elections in the city."Xi's remark will not scare us off, but only makes us more resolute and tenacious. We won't back down until the day when democracy comes," Wong said.US lawmakers act in supportThe renewed public anger in Hong Kong comes a day after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which will require Washington to review Hong Kong's human rights situation annually and to take sanctions against officials linked to rights abuses in the city, if approved by the Senate.Joshua Wong and fellow activist Denise Ho have pushed for the bill's passage, saying it will protect democracy in Hong Kong, and more than 100,000 protesters joined a rally on Monday night in which they sang the U.S. national anthem, waved American flags, and urged Congress to approve the act.Lam's administration hit back at the bill's passage in a statement on Wednesday, saying human rights were safe in their hands, and that democracy could only come after peaceful dialogue."The Hong Kong ... government attaches great importance to human rights and freedoms and is determined to safeguard them," the statement said. "Foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region."It said constitutional change could only take place on the basis of a decree from the China's National People's Congress (NPC) standing committee on Aug. 31, 2014, which insisted that election candidates in a one-person, one-vote scenario must be pre-approved by Beijing-backed officials.The ruling sparked the 79-day 2014 Occupy Central movement which rejected the proposal as "fake universal suffrage."Hong Kong citizens must decideU.S.-based legal scholar Lee Yuen said that any decisions on the future of Hong Kong should be made by its citizens."It's not going to benefit the Hong Kong and Beijing governments, let alone the pro-democracy faction, if they prevent people from standing as candidates," Lee said.Six pro-democracy lawmakers have already been stripped of their seats after Beijing ruled their oaths of allegiance invalid, while pro-democracy candidates have been barred from standing in LegCo by-elections on the basis of their political views.A number of would-be district election candidates, including Joshua Wong, are currently being questioned about their political views, amid concerns that their candidacies will be rejected before the elections even take place.The attack on Sham comes amid an ongoing debate among protesters about the use of violence in the form of rock-throwing, Molotov cocktails, and frontline attacks on riot police trying to disperse crowds, as well as acts of vandalism on China-linked businesses and public facilities that don't directly target people.Veteran democracy activist Richard Choi of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China said it is crucial that the protest movement stick to peaceful, non-violent direct action when standing up to the totalitarian might of Beijing."It is very hard to stand up to the totalitarian power that is the Chinese Communist Party," Choi said. "But once we let go of peaceful, rational protest and start using force, we are likely to be violently suppressed by the Chinese government.""What's more, we will lose the support and understanding of citizens both in Hong Kong and mainland China," he said. "We may even lose international support for the people of Hong Kong."Peaceful vs. violent protestA protester surnamed Wong told RFA that he doesn't oppose the force used by the movement's "frontline" fighters, however."Personally, as a frontline fighter, I don't oppose peaceful protest, which is part of an international strategy for fighting totalitarianism," he said.But there is currently a huge gap between the tendency of the police to inflict harm on people, and that of the protesters, he said."The Hong Kong Police Force imports its equipment from overseas, and there is nothing they won't do when it comes to harming Hong Kong people," Wong said. "We have seen this in recent reports of police brutality."Hong Kong current affairs commentator Sang Pu said other countries would likely prefer to see a peaceful protest movement in Hong Kong."None of them can tolerate being criticized by China for inciting the protesters to violent resistance," Sang said.But he said U.S. senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley hadn't mentioned protester violence when throwing their support behind the protest movement during a trip to Hong Kong earlier this week."Instead, they made a point of bringing up the shooting with live ammunition of an 18-year-old school kid in Tsuen Wan on Oct. 1, calling him another June 4, 1989 Tank Man," he said.The latest opinion survey carried out by the Chinese University of Hong Kong on behalf of the Chinese-language Ming Pao newspaper found that just 30 percent of respondents say they trust the police, their own government and Beijing, with waning public support for a purely peaceful movement.Seventy-two percent of those polled said the use of force by police was "excessive," while 75 percent said the government hadn't done enough to resolve the situation. Of that 75 percent, 70 percent said an independent inquiry would be a bare minimum to resolve the impasse.Reported by Tam Siu-yin and Lau Siu-fung for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Shi Shan and Han Jie for the Mandarin Service.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed. It hasn't had a more pronounced impact, though, for several reasons:The U.S. market has never been fully bothered by the idea of a disorderly Brexit, content it seems to see it as more of an issue for the UK and the EU.There is ample doubt still that it will win approval in Parliament.The relatively subdued response in the UK's FTSE 100 (+0.5%) and in the British pound (+0.2% against the dollar) suggests there is reason to keep enthusiasm in check at the moment.08:04BYSI BeyondSpring: US Patent Office has granted the Company a new patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,357,491 B2, for methods of treating a brain tumor by administering Plinabulin (18.30 )The patent, which expires in 2036, covers methods for Plinabulin's use in the treatment of brain tumors, including metastatic brain tumor, with no approved chemotherapy on the market, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common adult brain tumor.

In August 2019, PM Izhora submitted its objections disagreeing with MTI's allegations set forth in the initial assessment and MTI's methodology for calculating the alleged underpayments. MTI accepted some of PM Izhora's arguments and in September 2019, issued the final tax assessment claiming an underpayment of RUB 24.3 billion (approximately $374 million) including penalties and interest.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed.

In Europe, the major bourses are witnessing a mixed tape with the FTSE outpacing the region. The status of Brexit talks remains the key focus. The British pound has seen a volatile session and is up nearly 1%. This has not weighed on the FTSE, however. Outside of the UK, the markets have seen more of a cautious environment. Automakers are notably stronger, with Daimler and BMW both showing gains of greater than 0.5%.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +14.010 yr Note: 1.79%USD/JPY: 108.90 +0.13EUR/USD: 1.1117 +0.0045Europe: FTSE +0.6% DAX +0.3% CAC -0.1%Asia: Hang Seng +0.7% Shanghai -0.1% Nikkei -0.1%Gold (1488.90 -5.10) Silver (17.44 +0.01) Crude (53.18 -0.18)17:49EGO Eldorado Gold reports preliminary Q3 results; production guidance for 2019 remains unchanged (7.39 +0.16)Total gold production was 101,596 ounces for the third quarter and 276,376 ounces year-to-date. Guidance for 2019 remains unchanged. Recent test results from Kisladag confirm that recoveries from leaching deeper material over 250-day cycles support an extension of mine life beyond the company's current three-year guidance. Waste stripping to support a mine life extension will commence prior to the end of October. Test work is still ongoing to determine the ultimate heap leach recovery of this material and thus the ultimate length of the mine life extension. Waste stripping over the remainder of 2019 is expected to minimize production interruptions in 2020 and beyond. Estimated expenditure for waste stripping in 2019 is $4 mln. Production at Olympias was lower than plan. During the third quarter, measures to increase production volumes were continued in key areas of the operation and will support the ramp up towards 2020 and beyond. These measures included increased capital development resources and other operational improvement initiatives.17:37WTFC Wintrust Fin beats by $0.07, beats on revs (64.50 -0.29)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.69 per share, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.62; revenues rose 9.4% year/year to $380 mln vs the $374.98 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.17:36CCK Crown reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; guides Q4 EPS below consensus (63.53 +0.67)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.56 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.56; revenues fell 2.8% year/year to $3.08 bln vs the $3.19 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM.

The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively.

Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed. It hasn't had a more pronounced impact, though, for several reasons:The U.S. market has never been fully bothered by the idea of a disorderly Brexit, content it seems to see it as more of an issue for the UK and the EU.There is ample doubt still that it will win approval in Parliament.The relatively subdued response in the UK's FTSE 100 (+0.5%) and in the British pound (+0.2% against the dollar) suggests there is reason to keep enthusiasm in check at the moment.08:04BYSI BeyondSpring: US Patent Office has granted the Company a new patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,357,491 B2, for methods of treating a brain tumor by administering Plinabulin (18.30 )The patent, which expires in 2036, covers methods for Plinabulin's use in the treatment of brain tumors, including metastatic brain tumor, with no approved chemotherapy on the market, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common adult brain tumor.

In August 2019, PM Izhora submitted its objections disagreeing with MTI's allegations set forth in the initial assessment and MTI's methodology for calculating the alleged underpayments. MTI accepted some of PM Izhora's arguments and in September 2019, issued the final tax assessment claiming an underpayment of RUB 24.3 billion (approximately $374 million) including penalties and interest.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

That was the beginning of a tweet from EU Commission President Juncker in communicating the news that the EU and UK reached a compromise that would allow for the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU. Mr. Juncker is recommending that EU members back this deal when they meet later today.This headline is encouraging, although it is not to be thought of as concrete in light of press reports, which have indicated the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is unlikely to support the deal, as it still doesn't like the customs checks proposals. The opposition Labour Party reportedly isn't on board with this deal either.This is all setting up for a nail-biter vote in the UK Parliament this weekend. Bloomberg News has pointed out that Prime Minister Johnson needs to secure approximately 61 out of 75 available voters in Parliament if the DUP does not vote for this deal.If the new plan is not passed, Mr. Johnson would be obligated to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit deadline, which falls on October 31. He is loathe to do that, having promised pro-Brexit supporters that he would deliver on the Brexit referendum -- deal or no deal -- by October 31.The notion that a Brexit deal could be in the offing has helped boost the futures market a bit as it teases the possibility of a source of uncertainty being removed.

This is just off the session high of 3006.50 and left the overnight low sitting at 2985.25.In Asia, both the Nikkei and Shanghai closed fractionally lower on the day. The Shanghai opened higher but could not manage to maintain gains despite reports that the Chinese government is mulling loosening restrictions for foreign investors. The Nikkei was led lower by tech stocks. Tokyo Electron fell 9% after chip peer ASML saw weakness following earnings on Wednesday. In Europe, the major bourses are witnessing a mixed tape with the FTSE outpacing the region. The status of Brexit talks remains the key focus. The British pound has seen a volatile session and is up nearly 1%. This has not weighed on the FTSE, however. Outside of the UK, the markets have seen more of a cautious environment. Automakers are notably stronger, with Daimler and BMW both showing gains of greater than 0.5%.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +14.010 yr Note: 1.79%USD/JPY: 108.90 +0.13EUR/USD: 1.1117 +0.0045Europe: FTSE +0.6% DAX +0.3% CAC -0.1%Asia: Hang Seng +0.7% Shanghai -0.1% Nikkei -0.1%Gold (1488.90 -5.10) Silver (17.44 +0.01) Crude (53.18 -0.18)17:49EGO Eldorado Gold reports preliminary Q3 results; production guidance for 2019 remains unchanged (7.39 +0.16)Total gold production was 101,596 ounces for the third quarter and 276,376 ounces year-to-date. Guidance for 2019 remains unchanged. Recent test results from Kisladag confirm that recoveries from leaching deeper material over 250-day cycles support an extension of mine life beyond the company's current three-year guidance. Waste stripping to support a mine life extension will commence prior to the end of October. Test work is still ongoing to determine the ultimate heap leach recovery of this material and thus the ultimate length of the mine life extension. Waste stripping over the remainder of 2019 is expected to minimize production interruptions in 2020 and beyond. Estimated expenditure for waste stripping in 2019 is $4 mln. Production at Olympias was lower than plan. During the third quarter, measures to increase production volumes were continued in key areas of the operation and will support the ramp up towards 2020 and beyond. These measures included increased capital development resources and other operational improvement initiatives.17:37WTFC Wintrust Fin beats by $0.07, beats on revs (64.50 -0.29)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.69 per share, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.62; revenues rose 9.4% year/year to $380 mln vs the $374.98 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.17:36CCK Crown reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; guides Q4 EPS below consensus (63.53 +0.67)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.56 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.56; revenues fell 2.8% year/year to $3.08 bln vs the $3.19 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

This results is down $67 mln from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower alumina pricing that was partially offset by higher alumina sales volume and lower production costs.Co says a new operating model, which goes into effect on November 1, 2019, will result in a leaner corporate structure, with operations more closely connected to leadership, through elimination of the co's business unit structure and consolidation of sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level.In addition to reporting quarterly results, co also announces a multi-year portfolio review to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

TikTok could threaten national security, US lawmakers sayCNN WireOctober 25, 2019 Friday 6:46 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 557 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  TikTok, the viral short video app where millions of teens post comedy skits set to snappy music hooks, is facing growing backlash in the United States.US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle warn that the app could pose a national security risk, and are calling on regulators and intelligence agencies to investigate TikTok's ties to China. Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton want the US intelligence community to assess the national security risks of TikTok and other Chinese-owned platforms, saying in a statement Thursday that such apps could be used to spy on US citizens or become targets of foreign influence campaigns like the Russian meddling campaign to influence the 2016 US presidential election. TikTok, owned by Beijing-based parent company Bytedance, has exploded in popularity and become one of the few Chinese-owned social media apps to gain traction in Western countries. The app was downloaded 177 million times last quarter, down 4% compared to the same period last year, according to mobile data firm Sensor Tower. But it was still the second most downloaded app worldwide, just behind Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp. It also made $40 million in revenue on the iOS App store last quarter, and has amassed about 100 million users in the United States, according to Sensor Tower. TikTok is unavailable in China, though ByteDance owns a domestic version of the app there called Douyin.Because TikTok's parent company is based in China, it could be compelled "to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," the senators said, adding in a letter to the acting US Director of National Intelligence that "there is no legal mechanism for Chinese companies to appeal if they disagree with a request."TikTok said in a statement that it stores all US user data in the United States and backs it up in Singapore. "Our data centers are located entirely outside of China, and none of our data is subject to Chinese law," the company said in a statement Friday. "Further, we have a dedicated technical team focused on adhering to robust cybersecurity policies, and data privacy and security practices."Earlier this month, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio called for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which vets overseas purchases of American businesses, to review TikTok's acquisition of rival app Musical.ly. His request came after the Washington Post published a story investigating the absence of posts about the Hong Kong protests on TikTok, compared to other social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. "There continues to be ample and growing evidence that TikTok's platform for Western markets, including those in the United States, is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese Government and Communist Party directives," Rubio said in a statement at the time. TikTok said in its Friday statement that it doesn't remove content based on sensitivities related to China. "We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked," TikTok said, adding that its US moderation team "reviews content for adherence to our US policies --- just like other US companies in our space." TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Stocks Fall Sharply as Hopes for U.S.-China Trade Agreement DimTheStreet.comOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 9:45 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 714 wordsByline: Rob LenihanHighlight: Stocks are falling Tuesday as the U.S.blacklisted several China-based tech companies and a report that the White House was looking to limit investment in Chinese firms by government pension funds.BodyHere Are 3 Hot Things to Know About Stocks Right NowThe Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled as the U.S. blacklisted several China-based tech companies and a report said the White House was looking to limit investment in Chinese companies by government pension funds.    Domino's Pizza  was after the restaurant chain posted weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings and disappointing same-store sales. Domino's Pizza is Real Money's Stock of the Day.       Ambarella  tumbled after one of its biggest customers, China's Hangzhou Hikvision, was blacklisted by the Trump administration.    Wall Street Overview  Stocks were falling Tuesday as the United States blacklisted several China-based tech companies and a report said the White House was looking to limit investment in Chinese firms by government pension funds, just days before trade talks between the world's two largest economies are set to begin.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 216 points, or 0.82%, to 26,261. The S&P 500 dropped 0.89%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.86%. The Commerce Department unveiled the blacklist late Monday, targeting China-based tech companies operating in the artificial intelligence space that were deemed to have been "implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups." U.S.-listed shares for some of China's biggest companies were tumbling after a Bloomberg report said the White House was looking at ways to limit investment in Chinese firms by government pension funds. Shares of Alibaba Holding  , Baidu  and JD.com  were trading lower Tuesday. Bloomberg said the move, designed to restrict capital flows into China, was part of broader effort by the White House to tackle challenges linked to that country's capital markets. White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters in Washington on Monday that progress has been made ahead of the talks, adding the U.S. was open to any deal China brings to the table, after reports suggested Beijing was no longer interested in a broad-based agreement after more than a year of wrangling with the Trump administration. High-definition video chip designer Ambarella  felt the impact of the trade war as one of the company's biggest customers, China's Hangzhou Hikvision, was blacklisted by the Trump administration. Shares were down 13% to $49.81. Nike  fell as investors reacted to news that China's state-backed broadcaster, CCTV, said it would stop airing NBA games as the fallout from a tweet from the Houston Rockets' general manager threatens potential reprisals against U.S. companies operating in the world's second-largest economy. The stock fell 2% to $91.33.   Domino's Pizza  was down 5.3% to $229.49 after  posted weaker-than-expected third quarter earnings Tuesday and disappointing same-store sales. Domino's Pizza is Real Money's Stock of the Day.  Oracle  fell 1.1% to $54.21 after the  said it would ramp-up hiring to challenge larger rivals such as Amazon  and Microsoft  and as analysts at Jefferies cut their price target on the company. Boeing  shares fell 1.4% to $371.46 after the Wall Street Journal reported  between U.S. and European regulators could delay the return of the planemaker's 737 MAX jet. In economic news, the Labor Department said the producer price index, which measures inflation before it reaches consumers, fell 0.3% last month, the first drop since June and the biggest since January. Core wholesale prices, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, tumbled 0.3%. "The market is predicting another cut at 80% and given PPI's dramatic drop this morning, we could see the rate cut engines start to rev up," said Mike Loewengart, vice president of strategy at E*Trade. "While the Fed has made it very clear it's not interested in a prolonged rate cut campaign, the writing is essentially on the wall. Looking at the Fed's most important indicators-jobs remain strong but are showing pockets of weakness and CPI has been decidedly below the Fed's 2% target over the past four months."  Amazon and Microsoft are holdings in Jim Cramer's .

A survival analysis using a time-dependent Cox regression model showed that the difference in probability of survival between treated patients and untreated natural history control patients was highly statistically significant (p<0.0006). In addition to the survival benefit, the vast majority of treated patients (94.7%) had either improved (68%) or stabilized (26%) responses in major functional domains. Among clinical responders, a subset demonstrated profound responses, in some cases re-acquiring previously lost motor milestones.Safety & TolerabilitySafety data from RETRO indicated that SET is generally safe and well-tolerated. Most reported adverse events were considered not related to study drug (199 of 292), with mild or moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event, occurring in 63% of patients.Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 14 subjects (37%). The majority of SAEs were deemed related to TK2d; two patients experienced three events related to study drug alone (kidney stone, kidney stone removal, diarrhea).Two adult-onset patients stopped treatment due to asymptomatic increases in aminotransferase liver enzymes (no increase in bilirubin levels), which resolved upon discontinuation of treatment.08:07WIRES On The WiresAllergan plc (AGN) announced the launch of three new over-the-counter REFRESH RELIEVA products: REFRESH RELIEVA, REFRESH RELIEVA PF (preservative-free) multidose, and REFRESH RELIEVA FOR CONTACTS.

As per the study protocol, results were calculated using least square (LS) mean, which is a statistical approach that adjusts for observed baseline differences. 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved a =5% absolute reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo.Similarly, 72% of patients treated with aldafermin achieved a =30% relative reduction in LFC versus 17% for placebo. Of the patients treated with aldafermin, 28% achieved a normal LFC after 24 weeks, defined as =5% absolute LFC, versus none in the placebo arm. In addition, in assessing biomarkers of liver inflammation and injury, treatment with aldafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Treatment with aldafermin also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PRO-C3, an exploratory biomarker of liver fibrogenesis, as compared to placebo.As observed in the prior Phase 2 cohorts, patients treated with aldafermin in the Cohort 4 interim analysis experienced a mean increase of 47.6 mg/dL LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) at week 2 of treatment relative to baseline (103.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and potent FGFR4-mediated CYP7A1 inhibition. As per protocol, when elevation of LDL-C of at least 10 mg/dL was recorded, patients were directed to take an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant statin use mitigated the drug-induced LDL cholesterol rise, and the mean LDL-C level was below baseline at 24 weeks. In an assessment of other lipid biomarkers, the concurrent use of aldafermin with this statin protocol resulted in a slight increase in HDL-C and a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides relative to baseline.There were no study withdrawals and no serious adverse events in the aldafermin arm of the Cohort 4 interim analysis, as compared to one withdrawal due to an adverse event and two serious adverse events in the placebo arm.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade Policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUS.Related retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, M.Related agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS.07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019, to be slightly greater than the outlook the Company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

Pfenex anticipates submitting the final study report to the FDA as early as the second half of October 2019 and believes that this completes the information package required by the FDA to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of PF708.06:09BOLD Audentes Therapeutics presents new positive data from ASPIRO; Continued significant and durable improvements in respiratory function (27.84 )Audentes Therapeutics announced new positive data from ASPIRO, the clinical trial evaluating AT132 in patients with X-Linked Myotubular MyopathyEfficacy - Patients receiving AT132 have achieved significant and durable reductions in ventilator dependence, an endpoint considered to be closely correlated with morbidity and mortality in XLMTM patients. To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )The average U.S. rig count for September 2019 was 878, down 48 from the 926 counted in August 2019, and down 175 from the 1,053 counted in September 2018.

A couple of items driving trade this morning are: 1) a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand knowledge of allegations against President Trump that were outlined in the first complaint; and 2) conflicting reports on upcoming China trade talks are throwing enough uncertainty into the markets to keep buyers from being inspired. S&P Futures are off by fifteen points, trading around the 2936 level. This comes after spoos put in a high of 2943.25 and a low of 2928.00.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong were closed. Chinese markets will re-open tomorrow after a week-long hiatus. In Japan, the Nikkei gave back about 0.2%, which is encouraging considering key heavyweights such as Honda and Panasonic closed about 1% lower. In Europe, the major bourses are down but having an uneventful session. Germany posted a weaker than expected Factory Orders figure for August that came in at -0.6%, after the market expected a fall of only 0.3%. This, and the early pressure in the US, has seemingly kept a lid on equity gains throughout the region.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -16.010 yr Note: 1.52%USD/JPY: 106.84 -0.06EUR/USD: 1.0971 -0.0005Europe: FTSE -0.1% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.2%Asia: Hang Seng CLOSED Shanghai CLOSED Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1508.10 -4.80) Silver (17.50 -0.12) Crude (52.99 +0.18)18:02WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ENDP (3.82 +19.75%), ARQL (8.29 +18.43%), SRPT (88.25 +17.67%), CDNA (25.37 +16.22%), RGNX (38.49 +15.41%), ARWR (30.6 +13.5%)Materials: SBGL (6.36 +14.39%)Consumer Discretionary: TSG (20.92 +38.82%)Information Technology: RNG (163.3 +31.85%), AVYA (13.23 +28.45%), OKTA (116.53 +20.06%), COUP (148.32 +15.97%)Energy: TOO (1.53 +30.77%), DHT (6.88 +14.1%), STNG (33.65 +14.07%), FRO (10.28 +12.72%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: GTHX (23.34 -31.29%), LNTH (19.74 -22.04%), ANGO (14.6 -19.02%)Materials: SXC (5.31 -15.71%)Consumer Discretionary: GPRO (3.97 -21%), TAST (6.8 -16.46%)Information Technology: CASA (6.22 -20.47%)Financials: AMTD (33.7 -28.25%), ETFC (36.4 -15.87%)Energy: NBR (1.57 -18.65%), MDR (1.63 -18.5%), QEP (3.15 -17.54%), CDEV (3.8 -15.95%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (7.45 -34.76%), CALM (37.97 -16.4%)18:01NBIX Neurocrine Biosci presents new data analyses demonstrating long-term effects of INGREZZA that show effectiveness in reducing abnormal movements in adults with tardive dyskinesia (89.73 -0.20)The analyses of pooled data from multiple long-term studies of the 40 mg dose showed that 53.7% of patients taking 40 mg of INGREZZA achieved an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) response (= 50% improvement from baseline) after 48 weeks of treatment. INGREZZA is available in two doses, 40 mg and 80 mg. Additionally, an analysis of the pivotal Phase III KINECT 3 data demonstrated that 50% of patients achieved an early response after two weeks of INGREZZA treatment (40 mg or 80 mg).

It was a broad-based rally, led by shares of financial and technology companies, although trading volume was lighter than usual.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index, followed by the Russell 2000 (+1.0%).The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in September, which was slightly below expectations (Briefing.com consensus 150,000) but also better than expected when accounting for the upward revisions in August and July. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low at 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%), while average hourly earnings were unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Some pointed to no wage growth as a disappointment, but the modest jobs growth helped subdue this week's general growth concerns. Fed Chair Powell also repeated his view that the U.S. economy is "in a good place." The general sense of relief in the market helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average (2942).All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher. Eight sectors finished up at least 1.0%, including noticeable gains in the financials (+1.9%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors. Apple (AAPL 227.01, +6.19, +2.8%) carried the tech sector higher after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company asked suppliers to increase production for the iPhone 11 by up to 10%.HP (HPQ 16.64, -1.76, -9.6%) was left out of today's rally. The company announced it will reduce its global headcount by 7,000 to 9,000 employees as part of a restructuring plan. HP also authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 10%.U.S. Treasuries finished little changed despite the bullish bias in equities. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.39%, while the 10-yr yield declined basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 99.80. WTI crude rose 0.6%, or $0.30, to $52.78/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for September and included the Trade Balance report for August:September nonfarm payrolls were roughly in-line with expectations, but actually better than expected when accounting for the upward revision to nonfarm payrolls for August and July. September nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 (Briefing.com consensus 150,000). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, which is the lowest since December 1969.One key takeaway is that the 50-year low unemployment rate will play well politically in the present for the current administration. Another key takeaway, though, is that the average hourly earnings growth (actually, there was none) won't play so well economically.The trade deficit for August widened to $54.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$54.4 billion) from -$54.0 billion in July, as exports were $0.5 billion more than July exports while imports were $1.3 billion more than July imports.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that trade continues to drag on GDP growth, evidenced by the average third quarter real trade deficit being 0.8% above the second quarter average.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Credit report for August on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +20.3% YTDS&P 500 +17.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.9% YTDRussell 2000 +11.3% YTD16:08HEXO HEXO announces resignation of CFO Michael Monahan, effective today; appoints Stephen Burwash as new CFO (4.06 +0.10)Mr. Monahan commented on his decision to resign, saying, ""Since joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa.

Man up, NBAThe Observer: University of Notre DameOctober 11, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: VIEWPOINT; Pg. 1Length: 498 wordsByline: Mike EverettBodyOver the past few days, a bunch of stories have developed surrounding the Hong Kong protests, specifically the response of various Americans and their attempts to appease the Chinese government. Video game company Blizzard, a subsidiary of Activision, banned a Hong Kong player and renounced his winnings after he displayed pro-Hong Kong independence sentiments on a live stream. Apple removed an app from its app store, Hkmap.live, which protesters were using in order to monitor police presence at specific locations.However, the story which has grabbed most headlines has been about the NBA's tricky ties to the communist nation.Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a since-deleted tweet supporting the protests, which ignited a wave of anger from the NBA's Chinese business partners and Chinese fans. The NBA stands to lose billions if they choose to publicly criticize the Chinese government or stop playing games in China.Too bad.This isn't about money. Actually, it is - for the NBA. But it shouldn't be. NBA commissioner Adam Silver defended Morey's rights to free expression, but he essentially apologized to China and called the situation 'regrettable.' When asked to define the NBA's policy on matters such as these, Silver said in the statement:"It is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China - will have different viewpoints over different issues. ... It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences."That statement is inconsistent with the NBA's past history, and draws no distinction between matters of opinion and matters of morality. The NBA had no issue pulling the 2017 All-Star game from its initial location in Charlotte due to the controversial 'bathroom bill.' In that case, the NBA had no qualms about exercising a judgment between two competing viewpoints. Why is Hong Kong different?Either the NBA sees nothing wrong in the treatment of Hong Kong as of late, or nothing wrong in the abuse of power that has long defined the Chinese government or the moral obligation they feel is overridden by their love of money and fear of losing it. I'm not trying to say the situation between China and Hong Kong isn't complex and historically charged - it is. But I will say that China's attitudes toward basic human freedoms are fundamentally irreconcilable with the principles held by the United States. Such a difference can't be skirted around, either for reasons fueled by desire for sensitivity or for financial gain.The NBA has a rich history of providing a platform to express political views, but in this instance they are failing to live up to any moral imperative. The NBA needs to man up and defend the struggle for democracy in Hong Kong. They may lose out on a lot by doing so, but they would gain a whole lot more respect in my mind.The views expressed in this column are those of the author and not necessarily those of The Observer.

Apple responds to reports that it sends user traffic to China's TencentStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 17, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 475 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyUnfortunately, Apple does not specify under what conditions browsing data and a user's IP address might be sent to Tencent instead of Google.Apple's Safari program has since quite a while ago sent information to Google Safe Browsing to help ensure against phishing tricks utilizing itsFraudulent Website Warning element, yet it now seems Chinese tech goliath Tencent gets some data too. TheFraudulent Website Warning function is also made it possible for by default, so users aren't most likely to know that their IP address may be logged unless they decide to view the information screen.Apple says that it sometimes collects information about website that users visit but that is only if it requests more information to check if a questionable website is malicious.The company said that in their newer versions of Apple's iOS operating systems contain a feature that may directly log in IP address. "The actual URL of a website you visit is never shared with a safe browsing provider and the feature can be turned off", the company said.If you still find this feature scary, simply stop data-sharing by heading over toSettings Safari and turning "Fraudulent Website Warning" off. The browser can warn you by accessing Google's Safe Browsing service, which functions as a giant blacklist of malicious websites on the internet.In its statement, Apple claims that no information is sent to Google or Tencent.Realme X2 Pro Lands with 64MP Quad-camera SetupIt offers 4G VoLTE, WiFi 802.11 ac (2.4GHz + 5GHz) 2×2 MIMO, Bluetooth 5, GPS, GLONASS, NFC, and USB Type-C. The phone runs Color OS 6.1 which is based on Android 9 and will be upgraded to Android 10 later this month.Apple did say though, that if a website is found to be fraudulent then the IP (Internet Protocol) address of a user's device is shared with the Safe Browsing providers.Before visiting a website,Safari may send information calculated from the website address to Google Safe Browsing andTencent Safe Browsing to check if the website is fraudulent. As a result, Apple probably settled on Tencent as an alternative to protect iOS users in a major market.As Matthew Green, cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University explains, safe browsing providers send a list of hashed prefixes for malicious sites to users' phones.Meanwhile, you can turn offFraudulent Website Warning inSettings Safari. And the USA firm can only win back its market share by slashing its prices.Just recently, for example, the USA tech giant bowed to pressure from Beijing by removing a controversial app in Hong Kong that is quite useful for anti-government activists as it identifies police presence in areas across the territory.According to some media reports, the company has urged content providers for its Apple TV+ subscription service not to humiliate the Chinese government in their productions.Load-Date: October 17, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:50 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.12:50QGEN Qiagen leading med-tech/device stocks lower after warning about sales, citing significantly weaker-than-expected developments in China (25.43 -6.62)Qiagen also partner with Illumina (ILMN) for sequencing-based In-Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) tests and announced the departure of its CEO.Genomics/med-tech: PSNL -6.79% ADPT -6.74% NVTA -4.04% ILMN -3.58% Medical devices: WAT -6.13% BSX -5.89% TMO -5.83% PKI -5.18% A -2.86% MTD -2.76%12:30SDC SmileDirectClub slides 11% to fresh lows as recent IPOs remain under pressure (12.02 -1.47)Recent IPOs seeing similar relative weakness: JMIA -8.07%, ADPT -7.32%, PSNL -6.71%, SNDL -6.19%, STOK -6.06%, TCRR -5.93%, RVLV -5.35%, PRVL -5.00%, PTON -4.81% PLAN -4.80%, KRTX -4.79%, HARP -4.76%, LVGO -4.73%, HCAT -4.64%, CRWD -4.45%, THOR -4.38%, LK -4.28%, BBIO -3.97%, TWST -3.82%, etc...Of note for SDC, shares closed down 8% yesterday despite a wave of bullish analyst initiations upon expiration of the quiet period. Perhaps driven by the ongoing selling pressure on shares and resulting underperformance following September's IPO, SDC yesterday responded to the initiations, declaring that they reinforce the value of their business model, unit economics and mission:"Today's market reports reinforce the value of our business model, unit economics and mission to transform smiles through safe, affordable and consumer-first technology to an addressable market of approximately 500 million people worldwide.

Deliveries of the ES6 models "continued to ramp up"; 4,196 vehicles of the model were reported for the quarter. September deliveries were positively impacted ahead of China's national day holiday. Co also noted that it has seen accelerated growth of its order backlog since September. It is updating its retail pricing and battery pack offerings and will continue to "further enhance [its] offerings in an effort to accelerate orders and deliveries, going forward." NAT (3.27 +6.17%): Upgraded to Buy from Neutral and assigned a $4 price target at BTIG Research. The stock, which has advanced alongside shipping/tanker peers during sector outperformance in recent sessions, sees continued strength on more than 3x average volume, today generally outperforming peer names. At ten-month highs. HA (26.56 +5.36%): Reported upside September traffic stats -- total traffic increased +3.0% yr/yr on a +0.7% increase in capacity, with load factor increasing 1.9 points to 85.5% -- and raised its estimates for operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM), due to better than expected yields in long-haul markets, particularly in its International entity. Co also narrowed its estimates for operating cost per ASM ex. fuel and non-recurring items and for estimates for gallons of jet fuel consumer, and it lowered its estimates for economic fuel cost per gallon.Small Cap LosersPBYI (8.05 -20.06%): Downgraded to Sell from Neutral and price target cut to $8 from $24 at Goldman; hearing that the firm cites headline risk presented by upcoming competitive data from Seattle Genetics' (SGEN) tucatinib in the HER2-positive breast cancer space for the downgrade. Co also disclosed that its Chief Commercial Officer, Steven Lo, has decided to resign, effective October 18, in order to accept a CEO position at Zosano Pharma (ZSAN). At all-time lows. AZZ (36.74 -14.58%): Co's Q2 earnings report had been scheduled to be released this morning, but co instead announced today that it is rescheduling -- and thus, delaying -- its Q2 earnings release in order to grant co "additional time to complete the review of its Form 10-Q" for the quarter; co will announce the specific date and time of the rescheduled earnings call upon completion of the review. At multi-year lows. AMBA (51.57 -9.87%): The Department of Commerce added a number of Chinese organizations to its Entity List, including video surveillance companies Hikvision and Dahua Technology, which are major customers for co's components -- according to Needham, which downgraded co in June citing Entity List risk and which now reiterates its Underperform rating, the two customers accounted for 20-25% of co's total revenue over the past few quarters.

Video surveillance/facial recognition companies Hikvision and Dahua are among the newly blacklisted entities, alongside companies that work on artificial intelligence technologies.The news has caused broad-based weakness among chipmakers. There are currently 12 members of the SOX index showing losses of 3.0% or more. Interestingly, companies that are known for doing business with Hikvision and Dahua are not leading today's retreat. For instance, Intel (INTC 49.89, -0.73, -1.5%) is the second-best performer in the group while names like AMD (AMD 28.14, -0.79, -2.7%), NVIDIA (NVDA 177.96, -6.37, -3.4%), and Qualcomm (QCOM 73.53, -2.81, -3.6%) show losses between 2.7% and 3.6%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 47.90, -0.05, -0.1%) trades just below its flat line after notching a fresh record at the start of today's session. At this time, it may seem that the Taiwan-based company is shielded from being dragged into the conflict with China, but the contract chip manufacturer could see a decrease in orders if U.S. chipmakers are prevented from selling components to Chinese companies. Furthermore, there is also a risk that China could try to strengthen its grip over Taiwan and block TSM from fabricating chips for U.S. companies.10:18TALKX Market Briefing: Trade and growth concerns at heart of early selling interestIt's not a pretty picture in the stock market this morning. Every sector is lower, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 10% to 19.57, and the S&P 500 has dropped further below its 50-day moving average (2938.44).The negative price action is primarily a function of trade concerns, which ratcheted up following some awkward timing by the Department of Commerce in naming 19 Chinese governmental, and eight commercial, firms to its Entity List on the basis of their part in fostering human rights violations against Muslim ethnic minorities in China.That news hit last night and immediately created a diplomatic rift in front of this week's trade negotiations in Washington between senior U.S. and China trade officials. China for its part warned it will retaliate.Accordingly, a sense of nervousness ahead of those talks has fueled broad-based selling interest. The selling activity is predicated not just on a belief that the trade talks this week will be disappointing, but that the latest developments will keep a planned tariff rate increase from 25% to 30% on $250 billion worth of imported Chinese goods on track to be implemented October 15.The more general view of matters, and seemingly negative turn of events, is that the trade uncertainty is a negative for growth and earnings prospects alike.The biggest losers thus far are the financial (-1.8%), health care (-1.6%), information technology (-1.5%), and industrials (-1.4%) sectors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.1%; the S&P 500 is down 1.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.6%.10:10OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:WDC Oct 60 calls are seeing interest with 2560 contracts trading vs. open int of 1010, pushing implied vol up around 3 points to ~44%.

Co expects production to be at the mid-point of its original guidance of 28,000-31,000 boe/day and expects capital spending to be at mid-point of $195-$225 mln.Preliminary total company production for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019 averaged 29,600 boe/d with the month of September averaging 31,700 boe/d, compared to June's average of 27,400. The month of September production is nearly 88% oil, an increase from 86% in 2Q19.This improvement is primarily attributed to BRY'ss capital deployment to grow its California production. Preliminary California production, consisting of 100% Brent-based oil, for the quarter is approximately 22,900 bbl/d, an increase of 10.4% compared with last quarter and 17.7% with 3Q18.16:35HA Hawaiian Holdings reports Sept traffic (revenue passenger miles) +3% yr/yr on an increase of 0.7% in capacity (available seat miles); raises Q3 estimates for operating revenue per ASM (25.21 -0.49)Q3 update: Total traffic increased 2.7 percent on a decrease of 0.4 percent in capacity. Load factor increased 2.7 points to 87.8 percent. Company also raised its estimates for operating revenue per ASM due to better than expected yields in long-haul markets, particularly in its International entity to down 0.5% - up 0.5% from down 1.5-4.5%; narrowed its estimates for operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and non-recurring items; narrowed its estimates for gallons of jet fuel consumed; and lowered its estimates for economic fuel cost per gallon.16:34ACGL Arch Capital estimates $65-75 mln of catastrophe losses related to third quarter events (41.63 -0.23)Arch Capital expects to report third quarter 2019 pre-tax catastrophe losses of approx. $65-75 mln, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums. These losses are primarily from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. At this time, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the scope of damage for these events, as well as the other global events. The company's estimate for these events is based on currently available information; actual losses from these events may vary materially from the estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations. The loss estimates exclude the operations of Watford Holdings. Pursuant to GAAP, the company consolidates the results of Watford in its financial statements, although it only owns approx. 11% of Watford's outstanding common equity.16:22WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 declined 0.5% on Monday in a session replete with trade speculation and indecision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD16:20QGEN Qiagen also announces CEO transition; CEO Peer M.

The portfolio has a weighted average tax-equivalent yield of approximately 4.3% and consists mainly of fixed rate loans and leases. The portfolio will be integrated into Sterling's established national Equipment Finance platform, resulting in a pro forma combined portfolio of approximately $2 billion in total loans and leases outstanding.16:09ILMN Illumina partners with QIAGEN (QGEN) to deliver in-vitro diagnostic tests (301.63 -0.71)IlLMN and QGEN announce a 15-year partnership intended to broaden the availability and use of NGS-based IVD kits, including companion diagnostics, for patient management.The agreement grants QGEN non-exclusive rights to develop and globally commercialize IVD kits to be used together with Illumina's MiSeq Dx and NextSeq 550Dx Systems.The agreement also includes rights for expansion of the partnership on future Illumina diagnostic systems.

Since its March 21 IPO, LEVI has reported earnings twice. Last quarter, the company generated Non-GAAP EPS of $0.17 vs. the $0.12 consensus, posted inline revenue of $1.3 bln (+5.4% yr/yr), and also slightly raised its FY19 guidance.Specifically, it guided for Adj EBITDA margin improvement up to +10 bps from "flat to slightly higher", and constant currency net revenue growth to the "high end of mid-single digit range" from "mid single digits."Heading into tonight's report, the stock has been on a nice roll, climbing by 22% from the post-IPO lows hit in mid-August. The upswing suggests that investors are anticipating another good earnings report from LEVI.For the quarter, analysts are expecting LEVI to report Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 on revenue of $1.44 bln. It's worth noting that last quarter LEVI did not provide an Adjusted EPS number in its earnings press release. Adjusted net income and shares outstanding were provided, allowing for a Non-GAAP EPS number to be calculated.However, following the earnings release, the financial media honed in on the readily available GAAP EPS number, which came up short of expectations at $0.07 vs. the $0.08 consensus.The differing numbers created some initial confusion and volatility in the stock and is something to keep in mind should the same circumstance arise tonight.Competition and evolving consumer shopping habits have created a very challenging environment for retailers -- especially for those that are heavily reliant on brick-and-mortar stores. It is estimated that about 15-20% of LEVI's business is generated from U.S. department stores. Last quarter, LEVI's wholesale business grew by a scant 3% compared to 5% in Q1.Its exposure to department stores is fairly significant, but so far LEVI has done a good job of mitigating the soft performance in department stores by bolstering its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel, expanding internationally, and broadening its product lines to include more tops and women's categories.For instance, last quarter the DTC channel grew 14% and now represents at least 10% of the total business compared to just 4% early this year. Furthermore, LEVI's women's business was up 18% in Q2, marking the 15th straight quarter of growth for that category.The main question going forward is whether LEVI can continue to drive healthy revenue growth and margin expansion while the Americas region (+3% growth in Q2) continues to struggle due to weakness at U.S. department stores.While the company hasn't provided quarterly guidance in its earnings press releases, it might provide an updated outlook for FY19 Adj. EBITDA margin and constant currency net revenue growth.12:59VHC VirnetX Holding says prevails in appeals court as mandate issued in Apple (AAPL) suit (6.05 +0.09)The co announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the "Federal Circuit") has issued a formal mandate in the Federal Circuit case 2018-1197 (the "1197 Case") titled "Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in No. 6:10-cv-00417-RWS, Judge Robert Schroeder, III" (the "Apple I" case), in accordance with the judgment of the Federal Circuit, entered on January 15, 2019, affirming the judgement issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in this case.12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks down broadly as trade concerns growThe major averages on Wall Street are down noticeably today after the U.S. placed 28 more Chinese organizations on its trade blacklist. The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:50 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.12:50QGEN Qiagen leading med-tech/device stocks lower after warning about sales, citing significantly weaker-than-expected developments in China (25.43 -6.62)Qiagen also partner with Illumina (ILMN) for sequencing-based In-Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) tests and announced the departure of its CEO.Genomics/med-tech: PSNL -6.79% ADPT -6.74% NVTA -4.04% ILMN -3.58% Medical devices: WAT -6.13% BSX -5.89% TMO -5.83% PKI -5.18% A -2.86% MTD -2.76%12:30SDC SmileDirectClub slides 11% to fresh lows as recent IPOs remain under pressure (12.02 -1.47)Recent IPOs seeing similar relative weakness: JMIA -8.07%, ADPT -7.32%, PSNL -6.71%, SNDL -6.19%, STOK -6.06%, TCRR -5.93%, RVLV -5.35%, PRVL -5.00%, PTON -4.81% PLAN -4.80%, KRTX -4.79%, HARP -4.76%, LVGO -4.73%, HCAT -4.64%, CRWD -4.45%, THOR -4.38%, LK -4.28%, BBIO -3.97%, TWST -3.82%, etc...Of note for SDC, shares closed down 8% yesterday despite a wave of bullish analyst initiations upon expiration of the quiet period. Perhaps driven by the ongoing selling pressure on shares and resulting underperformance following September's IPO, SDC yesterday responded to the initiations, declaring that they reinforce the value of their business model, unit economics and mission:"Today's market reports reinforce the value of our business model, unit economics and mission to transform smiles through safe, affordable and consumer-first technology to an addressable market of approximately 500 million people worldwide. We remain focused on long term shareholder value - the next 12, 24, 36 months and beyond. Our entrance into the public market allows us to reinvest in innovation, process improvements, international growth and customer experience. Our commitment to our 5,500 team members, our customers and our mission is stronger than ever."12:20SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- NIO (NIO) improves following third quarter delivery results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersNIO (1.69 +9.03%): Provided a Q3 delivery update; co delivered 4,799 vehicles in the quarter, increasing +35.1% sequentially and exceeding the midpoint of co's guidance range by 499 vehicles, or +11.6%. Deliveries of the ES6 models "continued to ramp up"; 4,196 vehicles of the model were reported for the quarter. September deliveries were positively impacted ahead of China's national day holiday. Co also noted that it has seen accelerated growth of its order backlog since September. It is updating its retail pricing and battery pack offerings and will continue to "further enhance [its] offerings in an effort to accelerate orders and deliveries, going forward." NAT (3.27 +6.17%): Upgraded to Buy from Neutral and assigned a $4 price target at BTIG Research. The stock, which has advanced alongside shipping/tanker peers during sector outperformance in recent sessions, sees continued strength on more than 3x average volume, today generally outperforming peer names. At ten-month highs. HA (26.56 +5.36%): Reported upside September traffic stats -- total traffic increased +3.0% yr/yr on a +0.7% increase in capacity, with load factor increasing 1.9 points to 85.5% -- and raised its estimates for operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM), due to better than expected yields in long-haul markets, particularly in its International entity. Co also narrowed its estimates for operating cost per ASM ex. fuel and non-recurring items and for estimates for gallons of jet fuel consumer, and it lowered its estimates for economic fuel cost per gallon.Small Cap LosersPBYI (8.05 -20.06%): Downgraded to Sell from Neutral and price target cut to $8 from $24 at Goldman; hearing that the firm cites headline risk presented by upcoming competitive data from Seattle Genetics' (SGEN) tucatinib in the HER2-positive breast cancer space for the downgrade. Co also disclosed that its Chief Commercial Officer, Steven Lo, has decided to resign, effective October 18, in order to accept a CEO position at Zosano Pharma (ZSAN). At all-time lows. AZZ (36.74 -14.58%): Co's Q2 earnings report had been scheduled to be released this morning, but co instead announced today that it is rescheduling -- and thus, delaying -- its Q2 earnings release in order to grant co "additional time to complete the review of its Form 10-Q" for the quarter; co will announce the specific date and time of the rescheduled earnings call upon completion of the review. At multi-year lows. AMBA (51.57 -9.87%): The Department of Commerce added a number of Chinese organizations to its Entity List, including video surveillance companies Hikvision and Dahua Technology, which are major customers for co's components -- according to Needham, which downgraded co in June citing Entity List risk and which now reiterates its Underperform rating, the two customers accounted for 20-25% of co's total revenue over the past few quarters. The stock moves to its lowest levels since co issued upside Q3 revenue guidance in its Q2 earnings report.12:09PBYI Puma Biotech. plummets 21% to all-time lows after Goldman downgrades to Sell (cutting price target to $8 (from $24)) and Chief Commercial Officer Steven Lo resigns to pursue another opportunity (7.95 -2.12)11:48BA Boeing reported Q3 commercial airplane deliveries down 67% to 63; 737s down 91% to 5 (370.07 -6.47)Boeing reports this data monthly as well.11:41ASPS Altisource Portfolio Solutions to wind down and close Owners.com's operations (19.67 -0.40)The Company believes that closing Owners.com supports its simplification strategy, eliminates the cash burn associated with this earlier stage business, and increases focus on the core real estate and mortgage businesses.

Video surveillance/facial recognition companies Hikvision and Dahua are among the newly blacklisted entities, alongside companies that work on artificial intelligence technologies.The news has caused broad-based weakness among chipmakers. There are currently 12 members of the SOX index showing losses of 3.0% or more. Interestingly, companies that are known for doing business with Hikvision and Dahua are not leading today's retreat. For instance, Intel (INTC 49.89, -0.73, -1.5%) is the second-best performer in the group while names like AMD (AMD 28.14, -0.79, -2.7%), NVIDIA (NVDA 177.96, -6.37, -3.4%), and Qualcomm (QCOM 73.53, -2.81, -3.6%) show losses between 2.7% and 3.6%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 47.90, -0.05, -0.1%) trades just below its flat line after notching a fresh record at the start of today's session. At this time, it may seem that the Taiwan-based company is shielded from being dragged into the conflict with China, but the contract chip manufacturer could see a decrease in orders if U.S. chipmakers are prevented from selling components to Chinese companies. Furthermore, there is also a risk that China could try to strengthen its grip over Taiwan and block TSM from fabricating chips for U.S. companies.10:18TALKX Market Briefing: Trade and growth concerns at heart of early selling interestIt's not a pretty picture in the stock market this morning. Every sector is lower, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 10% to 19.57, and the S&P 500 has dropped further below its 50-day moving average (2938.44).The negative price action is primarily a function of trade concerns, which ratcheted up following some awkward timing by the Department of Commerce in naming 19 Chinese governmental, and eight commercial, firms to its Entity List on the basis of their part in fostering human rights violations against Muslim ethnic minorities in China.That news hit last night and immediately created a diplomatic rift in front of this week's trade negotiations in Washington between senior U.S. and China trade officials. China for its part warned it will retaliate.Accordingly, a sense of nervousness ahead of those talks has fueled broad-based selling interest. The selling activity is predicated not just on a belief that the trade talks this week will be disappointing, but that the latest developments will keep a planned tariff rate increase from 25% to 30% on $250 billion worth of imported Chinese goods on track to be implemented October 15.The more general view of matters, and seemingly negative turn of events, is that the trade uncertainty is a negative for growth and earnings prospects alike.The biggest losers thus far are the financial (-1.8%), health care (-1.6%), information technology (-1.5%), and industrials (-1.4%) sectors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.1%; the S&P 500 is down 1.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.6%.10:10OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:WDC Oct 60 calls are seeing interest with 2560 contracts trading vs. open int of 1010, pushing implied vol up around 3 points to ~44%.

Co expects production to be at the mid-point of its original guidance of 28,000-31,000 boe/day and expects capital spending to be at mid-point of $195-$225 mln.Preliminary total company production for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019 averaged 29,600 boe/d with the month of September averaging 31,700 boe/d, compared to June's average of 27,400. The month of September production is nearly 88% oil, an increase from 86% in 2Q19.This improvement is primarily attributed to BRY'ss capital deployment to grow its California production. Preliminary California production, consisting of 100% Brent-based oil, for the quarter is approximately 22,900 bbl/d, an increase of 10.4% compared with last quarter and 17.7% with 3Q18.16:35HA Hawaiian Holdings reports Sept traffic (revenue passenger miles) +3% yr/yr on an increase of 0.7% in capacity (available seat miles); raises Q3 estimates for operating revenue per ASM (25.21 -0.49)Q3 update: Total traffic increased 2.7 percent on a decrease of 0.4 percent in capacity. Load factor increased 2.7 points to 87.8 percent. Company also raised its estimates for operating revenue per ASM due to better than expected yields in long-haul markets, particularly in its International entity to down 0.5% - up 0.5% from down 1.5-4.5%; narrowed its estimates for operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and non-recurring items; narrowed its estimates for gallons of jet fuel consumed; and lowered its estimates for economic fuel cost per gallon.16:34ACGL Arch Capital estimates $65-75 mln of catastrophe losses related to third quarter events (41.63 -0.23)Arch Capital expects to report third quarter 2019 pre-tax catastrophe losses of approx. $65-75 mln, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums. These losses are primarily from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. At this time, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the scope of damage for these events, as well as the other global events. The company's estimate for these events is based on currently available information; actual losses from these events may vary materially from the estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations. The loss estimates exclude the operations of Watford Holdings. Pursuant to GAAP, the company consolidates the results of Watford in its financial statements, although it only owns approx. 11% of Watford's outstanding common equity.16:22WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 declined 0.5% on Monday in a session replete with trade speculation and indecision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD16:20QGEN Qiagen also announces CEO transition; CEO Peer M.

In the meantime, Thierry Bernard, SVP, Head of Molecular Diagnostics Business Area, will now act as interim CEO and work in tandem with Roland Sackers, CFO.16:11STL Sterling Bancorp to acquire $843 mln portfolio of middle market commercial equipment finance loans/leases from Santander Bank NA (SAN); expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2019 (19.34 -0.13)As of September 30, 2019, the balance of loans and leases outstanding to be acquired was $843 million. The portfolio has a weighted average tax-equivalent yield of approximately 4.3% and consists mainly of fixed rate loans and leases. The portfolio will be integrated into Sterling's established national Equipment Finance platform, resulting in a pro forma combined portfolio of approximately $2 billion in total loans and leases outstanding.16:09ILMN Illumina partners with QIAGEN (QGEN) to deliver in-vitro diagnostic tests (301.63 -0.71)IlLMN and QGEN announce a 15-year partnership intended to broaden the availability and use of NGS-based IVD kits, including companion diagnostics, for patient management.The agreement grants QGEN non-exclusive rights to develop and globally commercialize IVD kits to be used together with Illumina's MiSeq Dx and NextSeq 550Dx Systems.The agreement also includes rights for expansion of the partnership on future Illumina diagnostic systems.

Smoke fills the air as the police force them back. Shouts and the sound of glass breaking sound in the ears of those nearby as these protesters of Hong Kong fight for their rights.Oscar Chui, a senior studying exercise physiology, stands silently on the corner of a small street in Rexburg, Idaho. He'sOscar Chui lays out the flag he's promotingholding his flag and has a pocket full of flyers. He is trying his best to make a difference back home.Chui loves his old home: the fast pace of the city, the food and the values of hard work and family. Recently, the Chinese government started to enact laws and changes that challenge the Hong Kong citizens' lifestyle. This is where Chui said his frustrations began."What's happening right now is pretty bad," Chui said. "Since 1997 - when Hong Kong's sovereignty was handed back to China - human rights, democracy and environment have been restricted by the Chinese government."The flyers Oscar Chui handed outLike many other protesters, Chui disagrees with how the Chinese government is running things. To combat these changes, Chui is trying his best from all the way in Idaho. He started a Facebook page and stands on the street corner with his flag and flyers, trying to raise awareness."The United States treasures human rights, democracy and freedom," Chui said. "It's in their values. I want to raise awareness so people know whats going on and so they will stand with us.Currently, the United States is working on a bill called the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. This act allows Congress to treat Hong Kong separately from China and access the conditions in Hong Kong. Chui is trying to raise awareness about this act. He is also trying to raise awareness about the Extradition Bill.The Extradition Bill, a bill that allowed China to extradite prisoners from Hong Kong to be tried in China, has already been withdrawn, but that is not enough for Chui and his fellow protesters.Oscar Chui poses for photo"We Hong Kong citizens have five demands," Chui said. "The Chinese government cannot accept only one of those and then call it good. Those five demands are the center and the main reasons for the movement. The five demands are a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, independent inquiry of police brutality, retract characterization of riot, the release of arrested protesters and universal suffrage."Until those demands are met, the protesters will continue to protest, and Chui will still be standing on the corner, a flag in his hands and a pocket full of flyers.#sc_gallery-1 {margin: auto;}#sc_gallery-1 .gallery-item {float: left;margin-top: 10px;text-align: center;width: 33.33%;}#sc_gallery-1 img {border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;}#sc_gallery-1 .gallery-caption {margin-left: 0;}/* see sc_gallery() in functions/theme-shortcodes.php */Load-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

5G Automotive Association Comments for Electronic Toll Collection National Standard in ChinaTargeted News ServiceSeptember 20, 2019 Friday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 546 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: MUNICH, Germany BodyThe 5G Automotive Association issued the following news release:The 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) is a global, cross-industry organisation of companies from the automotive and telecommunications industries, working together to develop end-to-end solutions for future mobility and transport services.Following its vision, 5GAA has rapidly expanded to include key players, namely the automotive manufacturers, Tier-1 suppliers, chipset/communication system providers, mobile operators and infrastructure vendors. More than 120 companies have now joined 5GAA. Diverse both in terms of geography and expertise, 5GAA's members are committed to helping define and develop the next generation of connected mobility and automated vehicle and intelligent transport solutions.5GAA is willing to engage with the Chinese government and eco-system to accelerate the growth of the automotive industry and connected-automated driving services in China. Regarding Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) Onboard Unit (open for public comment), 5GAA fully supports the targets to phase out physical tolling stations in China and would like to share some views on introducing C-V2X technology to fulfil this function:* Our research and field tests indicate that C-V2X offers high network security and reliability, as well as better performance in terms of coverage and latency compared to other existing alternatives. 5GAA believes that enabling electronic toll collection (ETC) via C-V2X would offer significant benefits. 5GAA is acting to include tolling as one of the most critical use cases supported by C-V2X. In addition, we noticed that the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) V2X Technical Committee has worked on a similar objective. More importantly, in addition to vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), C-V2X supports vehicle-to-pedestrians (V2P), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-network (V2N), encompassing all scenarios of smart mobility;* C-V2X is the future-proof technology to evolve from LTE-V2X to NR-V2X and so on;* C-V2X has matured thanks to broad cross-industry support. Major carmakers are now speeding up the business cases and pre-installation of C-V2X in their vehicles. For example, 5GAA released its C-V2X deployment roadmap at the beginning of 2018 and expects the first batch of C-V2X-equipped cars to be commercialised as early as 2020.* With regard to industry development, 5GAA believes there are two phases for C-V2X to be implemented and to enable all services needed to realise intelligent transport:* Phase I: Utilising the existing C-V2X mature products and industry's support, including chipset, devices, vehicles and communication equipment, to address tolling service for highway scenarios.* Phase II: Based on C-V2X and its implementation in diverse categories of terminals like mobile phones (pre-installed and after-market), foster V2I synergy for the next ten years, e.g. highway tolling, Mobility as a Service (MaaS), for V2P, as well as road safety and coordinated driving for V2V.5GAA believes C-V2X technology is a critical technology enabler for in-vehicle ETC technology and recommends including C-V2X into the Chinese national standard covering the Electronic Toll Collection Onboard Unit.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6862489 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 20, 2019End of Document

Reality Shares Closing Two Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)Business WireOctober 15, 2019 Tuesday 6:00 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1359 wordsDateline: SAN DIEGO BodyThe Board of Trustees of the Reality Shares ETF Trust (the "Board") has decided to liquidate and close the Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy China ETF (BCNA) and the Reality Shares Fundstrat DQM Long ETF (DQML) (each, a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds") based on the recommendation of Reality Shares Advisors, LLC ("Reality Shares"), the Funds' investment advisor.BCNA will cease trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq"), DQML will cease trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc. ("NYSE"), and the Funds will be closed to purchase by investors as of the close of regular trading on the Nasdaq and NYSE on October 22, 2019 (the "Closing Date"). The Funds will not accept purchase orders after the Closing Date.Shareholders may sell their holdings in the Funds prior to the Closing Date, and customary brokerage charges may apply to these transactions. This process will result in a Fund increasing its cash holdings and, as a consequence, not tracking its underlying index, which is inconsistent with each Fund's investment objective and strategy.On or about the Liquidation Date, each Fund will liquidate its assets and distribute cash pro rata to all remaining shareholders. From October 22, 2019, through October 29, 2019 (the "Liquidation Date"), shareholders may only be able to sell their shares to certain broker-dealers and there is no assurance that there will be a market for a Fund's shares during this time period. Between the Closing Date and the Liquidation Date, each Fund will be in the process of closing down and shareholders who have not previously redeemed or exchanged their shares. These distributions are taxable events. In addition, these payments to shareholders will include accrued capital gains and dividends, if any. As calculated on the Liquidation Date, each Fund's net asset value will reflect the costs of closing the Fund. Once the distributions are complete, the Funds will terminate.About Reality SharesAt Reality Shares, we strive to deliver ETFs based on innovative investment methodologies.

Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.Investing involves risks, including the risk of loss of principal. For BCNA, the Fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or other occurrence and may therefore be more volatile than a more diversified fund. Fund risks include Authorized Participant Concentration Risk, Blockchain Technology Risk, Depositary Receipt Risk, Emerging Markets Risk, Equity Risk, Non-Blockchain Technology Business Line Risk, Index Performance Risk, Index Tracking Error Risk, Sector Risk, Industry Concentration Risk, Market Risk, and Non-Diversification Risk. See prospectus for full description of risks, which may negatively impact the Fund's investment strategy and could cause the Fund to lose money, cause the value of an investment in the Fund to decline over short- and long-term periods. The principal value of debt securities typically decrease when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. The Fund may also invest in foreign securities, which involve political, economic, and currency risks, greater volatility, and differences in accounting methods. Special risks associated with investments in Chinese companies include exposure to currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive company information, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards the nature and extent of intervention by the Chinese government in the Chinese securities markets, and the potential unavailability of shares. Index reconstitution may result in high portfolio turnover which may result in higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when the Fund shares are held in a taxable account. Although the Fund's shares are listed on an exchange, there can be no assurance that an active, liquid or otherwise orderly trading market for shares will be established or maintained. Blockchain technology is a new and developing technology protocol developed by companies in a manner for optimizing business practices. Blockchain technology is not a product or service with an individually attributable revenue stream. Blockchain technology may never develop optimized transactional processes that lead to increased economic returns to any company in which the Fund invests. There can be no assurance that blockchain technology will affect the primary lines of business in the Fund's portfolio companies to have a positive impact on a company's financial condition. Shares are not FDIC insured.For DQML, Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. The fund is subject to large-cap risk and may underperform other segments of the equity market or the equity market as a whole. The prices of equity securities in which the fund invests rise and fall daily. The fund's net value will generally decline when the market value of its targeted index declines. Although the Fund's shares are listed on an exchange, there can be no assurance that an active, liquid or otherwise orderly trading market for shares will be established or maintained. The Fund may have portfolio turnover, which may cause an adverse cost impact. There may be additional portfolio turnover risk as active market trading of the fund's shares may cause more frequent creation or redemption activities that could, in certain circumstances, increase the number of portfolio transactions as well as tracking error to the Index and as high levels of transactions increase brokerage and other transaction costs and may result in increased taxable capital gains. The fund's use of leverage allows for investment exposure in excess of net assets, thereby magnifying volatility of returns and risk of loss. Swaps, futures, forwards and options investments may be affected by the overall market and industry- and specific factors, and may be more volatile and less liquid than other investments. Investing in derivatives is a specialized activity that involves special risks that subject the fund to significant loss potential, including when used as leverage, and may result in greater fluctuation in fund value. The Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets, other than collateral held from securities lending, if any, in component securities of the Index. The Fund may also invest up to 20% of its assets in swaps, futures, forwards, options, exchange-traded funds As a non-diversified fund, fewer investments could have a greater effect on performance. The fund is passively managed and seeks to track the performance of an index. The fund may not sell a poorly performing security unless it was removed from the index. There is no guarantee that the index will achieve positive returns. Risk exists that the index provider may not follow its methodology for index construction. Errors may result in a negative fund performance. This fund is newly organized and has limited operating history.

Pro-Hong Kong graffiti appears on College of Arts and Sciences exteriorThe Daily Free Press: Boston UniversityOctober 21, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: BLOG; Pg. 1Length: 565 wordsBodyThe Tsai Performance Center, located in the Boston University College of Arts and Sciences, where a pro-Hong Kong message was spray painted on the exterior early Sunday morning. HANNAH YOSHINAGA/ DAILY FREE PRESS STAFFBy Dana Sung and Vanessa KjeldsenA graffiti vandalization with pro-Hong Kong statements occurred outside of the Boston University's College of Arts and Sciences around midnight Sunday.The graffiti, which included language like "Free Hong Kong," was removed by BU Sunday morning. The vandals have not been yet identified.Since the first large march in Hong Kong on June 9, the Hong Kong protests have received international attention. The protests originally focused on an extradition bill for handling the suspects of crimes. The bill sparked outrage in Hong Kong residents because it would give China more legal jurisdiction.BU Spokesperson Colin Riley said graffiti is a common occurrence in Boston."Unfortunately, [it happens] all too frequently," Riley said. "All you need to do is look around the city of Boston and see vandalism on the light posts, on the walkways, et cetera."While graffiti vandalism is not too uncommon, this situation was unique since it was a clear exhibition of a political statement, Riley said."This is different obviously," Riley said. "I would say this is someone, some individuals, making a political statement."The graffiti was in black spray paint, drawn in with a stenciled logo that Riley was "not familiar with." BU is not willing to share the photos of the graffiti at this point of the investigation, Riley said.The split of government system between China and Hong Kong dates back to the "one country, two system" policy implemented back in the 1980s for the reunification of China. This policy however has an expiration date, 2047, when the semi-autonomous region is set to end. This leaves Hong Kong entirely under China's jurisdiction.Sam Strom, a sophomore in the College of Communications, agrees with the pro-Hong Kong support on-campus."Well, I'm not a fan of the current Chinese government," Storm said "I think it is highly authoritarian ... and the US - especially major corporations in the US - have an obligation to sort of put the ethics of supporting Hong Kong's freedom above business."O'Neil Henry, a junior in COM, said it's valid to make a political statement using graffitti."Art is political," Henry said. "Yeah, I mean, if nobody's listening and you're putting it somewhere where people will listen, then it kind of makes sense."Veronica Harris, a freshman in COM, said she supports students making political statements."I think it's really cool to see students standing up for what they believe in," Harris said. "I mean, we're all students here. It's Boston University. It is cool to see people standing up, fighting for what's right and what they believe in."However, no matter the cause or story behind the graffiti, vandalism on BU property is against policy under the "Specific Violations of Student Responsibilities," section 9. Riley said that BU is trying to figure out who is responsible for the graffiti."We vigorously prosecute vandals," Riley said. "I would say that people right now are trying to identify the individuals. We don't know that it was a group - we do know there were a couple people that are seen doing it. But it will take a little bit of investigation to find them, if it is possible."Load-Date: October 22, 2019End of Document

Senate Energy &#38; Natural Resources Committee Issues Report on Nuclear Energy Leadership ActTargeted News ServiceOctober 3, 2019 Thursday 7:44 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4155 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Oct. 3 -- The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee issued a report (S.Rpt. 116-114) on legislation (S. 903) to direct the secretary of Energy to establish advanced nuclear goals, provide for a versatile, reactor-based fast neutron source, make available high-assay, low-enriched uranium for research, development, and demonstration of advanced nuclear reactor concepts. The report was advanced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Sept. 24.Excerpts of the report follow:PurposeThe purpose of S. 903 is to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish advanced nuclear goals, provide for a versatile, reactor-based fast neutron source, and make available high- assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) for research, development, and demonstration (RD&#38;D) of advanced nuclear reactor concepts.Background and NeedNuclear plants have operated safely and reliably since their initial commercial deployment in the 1950s in the U.S.-- and currently represent about 60 percent of the United States' carbon free power and nearly 20 percent of all of the nation's electric power generation. Civil nuclear technology today heavily relies on light-water reactor technology developed in the 1950s for use by the U.S. Navy. Because the U.S. had the most robust and advanced technology at the time, the U.S. was the undisputed international leader on proliferation safeguards, technology, materials, and global industry safety standards. Additionally, the nuclear science and engineering ecosystem developed within the U.S. to support the commercial and defense sectors was comprised of the world's best laboratory capabilities, university professors, and nuclear supply chain, which bolstered our national security enterprise, including the best-in class naval reactors on U.S. submarines and aircraft carriers.These same experts were testing light-water technologies and other more exotic advanced reactor designs at sites that would become today's Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories. At that time, the U.S. was investigating different types of coolants, fuels, and materials that promised increased reactor performance. However, many of the technologies and materials were not yet ready for full-scale commercial deployment.Due to the economic challenges that face large light water reactors and interests to reduce carbon, innovators around the world have been working to commercialize advanced nuclear reactors. In doing so, they are revisiting data collected during the 1960s, but moving beyond initial tests to design the next-generation of reactors. While based on old concepts, the innovations rely on new ideas and employ state of the art computer engineering, physics, design tools, and materials.The U.S. has ceded global nuclear leadership to China and RussiaThe U.S. has since lost its position in global nuclear leadership, having been surpassed by China and Russia. These nations and other U.S. competitors continued to build new nuclear reactors through the 1990s and 2000s, within their borders and around the world. Since 1990, the U.S. has completed only one commercial reactor construction project, at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar plant (although this reactor's construction was started in the 1980s and then put on hold for decades until completion in 2016).The health of the U.S. nuclear sector will depend on not only its ability to deploy reactors domestically, but on its ability to meet global market needs. More than 1.3 billion people will require electricity to move out of poverty while simultaneously working to cut carbon emissions. The Chinese government has committed to construct 120 to 150 gigawatts- electric of nuclear by 2030 and India wishes to meet 25 percent of its electricity needs with nuclear energy by 2050. Access to the global nuclear market, which is estimated at over $75 billion in new investment annually, and ability to provide advanced nuclear technologies on a relevant timescale will determine the competitiveness of U.S.-based technologies.In addition, the U.S. has prematurely shut down seven reactors since 2013, due to various issues, including economic competition from natural gas and subsidized renewables, anti- nuclear political pressure, and maintenance challenges. There are now 98 commercial reactors operating in the U.S. with only two new units currently under construction and an additional 12 units scheduled to be closed by 2025. Continued investment in material and fuel research is essential for maintaining the viability of the commercial reactor fleet.The loss of U.S. nuclear leadership has broad impactsThe loss of leadership equates to adverse effects on U.S. clean energy generation, economic competitiveness, and national security. To reestablish global nuclear leadership, the U.S. must have a healthy nuclear ecosystem capable of designing and deploying the most advanced reactor concepts in the world at a competitive price.At the Committee's February 28, 2019, hearing to examine global markets, Dr. Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, testified as to the importance of nuclear energy within the U.S. energy generation mix, as well as American global leadership on nuclear issues. At the Committee's February 7, 2019, hearing on the status and outlook of energy innovation in the United States, multiple witnesses testified regarding the importance of advanced nuclear technologies as key components in a future generation mix that is clean, safe, reliable, flexible, and diverse.Fortunately, there is a burgeoning community of advanced reactor innovators in the U.S., led by the private sector and supported by DOE and its national laboratories. A study by Third Way in 2016 identified 54 advanced reactor developers in the U.S. Three of these companies provided testimony to the Committee at a May 17, 2016, hearing on advanced nuclear technologies.Micro-reactors can lower emissions, power remote communities, and further national security effortsOne of the most challenging sectors of the energy economy from which to lower carbon emissions is the diesel generation market. Powering small remote communities, military installations, and remote mineral development projects, as well as providing backup power for high-value assets, continuous manufacturing processes, hospitals, and other community services are all dominated by diesel generation, which is often high-cost and high-emissions. Recent studies have shown that a subset of advanced reactors, called micro-reactors, could provide power on the order of single megawatts, be immediately competitive with diesel power, and lower energy costs substantially.As authorized by the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-232), the Department of Defense (DoD) and DOE are exploring potential micro-reactors that could provide reliable and resilient power to DoD bases and installations. This effort is building upon other work that has examined the usefulness of micro-reactors or small modular reactors for defense needs, including a Defense Science Board Report from 2016 and a study by Sandia National Laboratory for the U.S. Air Force.Industrial applicationsThe industrial sector relies on process heat to manufacture iron and steel, forest products, advanced materials, cement, glass, and many other products. Process heat requires a high amount of energy in order to reach temperatures as high as 1500+C and is currently dependent on carbon-intensive technologies. The industrial sector represents around 20 percent of total direct U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and will require technological advances in nuclear energy to become a zero emission sector. Additionally, advanced nuclear could also play a critical role in hydrogen production and seawater desalination processes.Challenges facing commercial nuclear innovationDespite the many anticipated benefits of advanced reactors, including micro-reactors, there are many challenges that stand in the way of commercial nuclear innovators based in the U.S. bringing technologies to market in a globally relevant timeframe.The advanced nuclear industry needs access to testing capabilities that do not currently exist in the U.S., including neutron irradiation facilities with a fast-neutron spectrum, and access to high assay low-enriched uranium, which is not commercially available in the U.S. There is also the need to identify and develop a market for early first adopters of their technologies. Meanwhile, the advanced nuclear industry, DOE, the National Nuclear Security Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission all need qualified nuclear scientists and engineers who can research, develop, commercialize, regulate, and safeguard advanced nuclear reactor technologies. S. 903, the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, would set new policies for DOE to facilitate public-private partnerships to meet these specific challenges and accelerate the path to market for multiple advanced nuclear reactor technologies.Driven by the need for reliable carbon-free power, many nations are considering nuclear energy for their futures. According to an International Trade Commission Report, in 2016 the U.S. Department of Commerce estimated that the global nuclear market may be worth up to $740 billion over 10 years. Competitor nations will continue pursuing their own advanced reactor concepts, making the export of nuclear technologies a geostrategic national goal. Many companies in competitor nations are state-owned enterprises. The governments of China and Russia fully back their nationalized nuclear corporations when opportunities for export arise in the global marketplace.U.S.-based companies can compete globally if they lead the world with the best technologies. S. 903 is intended to position U.S. innovators to successfully develop, demonstrate, and deploy their advanced reactor concepts and reestablish the U.S. as the global nuclear leader.Legislative HistoryS. 903 was introduced by Senator Murkowski, for herself and Senators Booker, Alexander, Manchin, Risch, Whitehouse, Crapo, Coons, Capito, Duckworth, Sullivan, Bennet, Graham, Portman, and Gardner, on March 27, 2019. Senators Braun, Cardin, Cramer, and Jones were added as cosponsors. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 903 on April 30, 2019.Similar legislation, H.R. 3306, was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Luria on June 18, 2019 and referred to the Science, Space and Technology Committee; the Energy and Commerce Committee; the Oversight and Reform Committee; and the Armed Services Committee.In the 115th Congress, Senator Murkowski, for herself and Senators Booker, Risch, Crapo, Capito, Durbin, Whitehouse, Manchin, and Coons, introduced nearly identical legislation, S. 3422, on September 6, 2018. Senators Bennet and Duckworth were added as cosponsors. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee conducted a hearing on S. 3422 on November 29, 2018.Related legislation, H.R. 5260, was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Higgins on May 22, 2018, and referred to the Science, Space and Technology Committee. H.R. 4378, related legislation, was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Weber on November 13, 2017, and was reported by the Science, Space and Technology Committee on February 13, 2018 (H. Rept. 115-557). The House passed H.R. 4378 by voice vote on February 2, 2018, and the measure was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in the Senate.The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources met in open business session on July 16, 2019, and ordered S. 903 favorably reported, as amended.Committee RecommendationThe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in open business session on July 16, 2019, by a majority voice vote of a quorum present, recommends that the Senate pass S. 903, if amended as described herein. Senators Lee and Hirono asked to be recorded as voting no.Committee AmendmentDuring its consideration of S. 903, the Committee adopted an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The substitute amendment modifies section 640 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005, Public Law 109-58), as added by section 3 of the bill, to clarify that only a reactor that receives its first license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission after January 1, 2019, can qualify for the Commercial Nuclear power purchase agreement (PPA) pilot program. It also adds the word "nuclear" before "power purchase agreement" in section 640(a) for further clarification.The substitute amendment modifies the definition of "Demonstration Project" in section 959A of EPAct 2005, as added by section 4 of the bill, to include the demonstration of privately funded experimental advanced reactors on DOE land and advanced reactors demonstrated by DOD in cooperation with DOE.The substitute amendment modifies section 959A(c) to use the phrase "enter into agreements to complete" instead of "the Secretary of Energy shall demonstrate."The substitute amendment adds a new section 959A(c)(2)(C)(iii) specifying that the external review is not required for reactors that are not Federally funded. The amendment further modifies section 959A(c)(2)(D) to clarify that cost-sharing provisions in section 988 of EPAct 2005 only apply to Federally-funded demonstration projects.The substitute amendment adds a new section 959A(c)(2)(G) requiring that the Secretary of Energy seek to ensure demonstrations projects will not slow existing advanced reactor deployments underway at time of enactment.The substitute amendment also adds a new finding to section 7 of the bill that nuclear fuel supply technology originating in the United States is not required for use in civilian advanced reactor applications, and modifies the fourth finding in section 7 to clarify that no domestic uranium enrichment capability "is licensed" for HALEU instead of "exists."The substitute amendment adds a new subsection (b)(4)(B) to section 960 of EPAct 2005, as added by section 6(b) of the bill, requiring the Secretary to consider the impact of the HALEU provision on DOE's requirements to support medical isotope production.The substitute amendment adds a new subsection (c)(2)(D) to section 960 that adds medical isotope producers to the stakeholder list for the required report on options to provide HALEU for advanced reactor development.The substitute amendment modifies the authorization of appropriations in section 313 of the 2009 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (Public Law 111-8), as amended by section 8(b) of the bill, for the University Nuclear Leadership Program. The modification authorizes $45 million annually and is equally distributed between the Secretary of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator, and the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Section-by-Section AnalysisSection 1. Short titleSection 1 sets forth the short title of the bill.Sec. 2. Authorization of long-term power purchase agreementsSection 2 amends 40 U.S.C. 501(b)(1)(B) to extend the maximum length of Federal power purchase agreements (PPAs) from 10 years to 40 years, and clarify that the contract costs for any fiscal year (FY) under the provision may be paid from the annual appropriations for that FY.Sec. 3. Long-term nuclear power purchase agreement pilot programSection 3 amends subtitle B of title VI of EPAct 2005 to add a new "Section 640. Long-Term Nuclear Power Purchase Agreement Pilot Program." The new section 640 directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program in which DOE will work with other relevant agencies to identify and enter into at least one federal PPA by December 31, 2023, from a new NRC- licensed nuclear power facility for a period longer than 10 years. Special consideration will be given to, and above market rates will be allowed for, first-of-a-kind or early deployment nuclear technologies that can provide reliable and resilient power to high-value assets for national security purposes or other national interest purposes, especially in remote off-grid scenarios or grid-connected scenarios that can provide emergency islanding power capabilities.Sec. 4. Advanced nuclear research and development goalsSection 4 amends subtitle E of title IX of EPAct 2005 to add at the end a new "Section 959A. Advanced Nuclear Reactor Research and Development Goals." Subsection (a) of the new section 959A defines key terms. Subsection (b) requires the Secretary to advance the research and development of advanced reactor technologies. Subsection (c) directs the Secretary to enter into agreements to complete two or more advanced reactor technologies by December 31, 2025, and an additional two to five reactors by December 31, 2035; specifies requirements, including design diversity, special considerations, cost- effectiveness, and cost-share; and directs the Secretary to conduct R&#38;D with the private sector. Subsection (d) directs the Secretary to establish goals for advanced nuclear reactor- related research that support the program's objectives, coordinate with private industry to advance design demonstrations, and ensure that research activities and programs meet certain requirements.Sec. 5. Nuclear energy strategic planSection 5 amends subtitle E of title IX of EPAct 2005 to add at the end a new "Section 959B. Nuclear Energy Strategic Plan." The new section 959B requires the Secretary to develop a 10-year strategic plan for the Office of Nuclear Energy within 180 days after enactment of the act. The plan, which is to be provided to relevant Congressional committees, is required to identify those programs that directly support the goals developed under section 4, as well as those deemed important to DOE's mission. It also requires anticipated milestones for the success and sun-setting of current programs, while identifying future programs leading to a coherent and staged strategic plan. An update to the plan is required to be submitted to relevant Congressional committees every two years.Sec. 6. Versatile, reactor-based fast neutron sourceSection 6 amends section 955(c)(1) of EPAct 2005 to direct the Secretary to provide for a versatile, reactor-based fast neutron source, which shall operate as a national user facility.Sec. 7. Advanced nuclear fuel security programSection 7 sets forth Congressional findings and amends subtitle E of title IX of EPAct 2005 to add at the end a new "Section 960. Advanced Nuclear Fuel Security Program." Subsection (a) of the new section 960 defines key terms. Subsection (b)(1) directs the Secretary to establish a program, within one year of the date of enactment, to make available HALEU, through contracts for sale, resale, transfer, or lease, for use in commercial or noncommercial advanced nuclear reactors. Subsection (b)(2) requires the Department to retain ownership of the fuel and retain responsibility for disposing of radioactive waste. Subsection (b)(3) prescribes minimum quantities and date requirements for making HALEU available. Subsection (b)(4) prescribes factors the Secretary should take into consideration in carrying out the program under subsection (b), including providing HALEU from the Department's stockpile and requirements to support molybdenum-99 production. Subsection (b)(5) prohibits the Secretary from bartering or otherwise selling or transferring uranium in exchange for services relating to the disposal of radioactive waste from uranium leased under subsection (b). Subsection (b)(6) terminates the program on the earlier of January 1, 2035, or the date in which HALEU can be provided by the commercial market. Subsection (c) requires a comprehensive report to be provided to relevant Congressional committees within 180 days of the enactment. Subsection (d) requires the Secretary to conduct an R&#38;D program for HALEU transportation.Sec. 8. University nuclear leadership programSection 8 sets forth Congressional findings and amends Section 313 of the 2009 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (Public Law 111-8) to authorize the University Nuclear Leadership Program, to be administered jointly by the Secretary, the NNSA Administrator, and the NRC Chairman. The new program replaces the Integrated University Program which expires in 2019 and will provide financial assistance through scholarships, fellowships, and R&#38;D projects at institutions of higher education in nuclear science and engineering, and related technical fields. This section authorizes $45 million annually for this program (the current funding level), to be split equally among the Secretary, NNSA Administrator, and the NRC.Cost and Budgetary ConsiderationsThe Congressional Budget Office estimate of the costs of this measure has been requested but was not received at the time the report was filed. When the Congressional Budget Office completes its cost estimate, it will be posted on the internet at www.cbo.gov.Regulatory Impact EvaluationIn compliance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee makes the following evaluation of the regulatory impact which would be incurred in carrying out S. 903. The bill is not a regulatory measure in the sense of imposing Government-established standards or significant economic responsibilities on private individuals and businesses.No personal information would be collected in administering the program. Therefore, there would be no impact on personal privacy.Little, if any, additional paperwork would result from the enactment of S. 903, as ordered reported.Congressionally Directed SpendingS. 903, as ordered reported, does not contain any congressionally directed spending items, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate.Executive CommunicationsThe testimony provided by the Department of Energy at the November 29, 2018, hearing on S. 3422, a similar bill to S. 903, follows:Testimony of Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes, U.S. Department of EnergyNuclear energy is clean, reliable, and safe, but the nuclear power industry needs to continue to innovate.Advanced reactors, including small modular reactors, hold great promise as a clean, reliable, and secure power source for our nation. The Department recognizes that advanced reactors face challenges to ultimately achieving commercialization. In addition to early-stage research and development the Administration supports prioritized investments in nuclear energy research infrastructure to enable private sector innovation.S. 3422 (murkowski-ak) nuclear energy leadership actThe Nuclear Energy Leadership Act would enhance nuclear energy innovation, specifically related to advanced nuclear reactor technologies by providing goals for DOE to further accelerate the development of advanced reactor technologies, developing a program for making available the fuel required by these advanced reactors, and supporting the development of the high-skilled workforce needed to develop, regulate, and safeguard advanced reactors. This bill would also extend federal power purchase agreements (PPAs) from 10 years to 40 years, and require DOE to enter into at least one PPA from a commercial nuclear reactor by 2023.DOE has reviewed this bill and has a few observations:The requirement to enter into at least one agreement to purchase power from a commercial nuclear reactor is achievable at Idaho National Laboratory if it is done through a phased agreement to include the Idaho Power Company. However, potential conflicts with state law may need to be addressed.The bill would authorize the Secretary to enter into one or more agreements to carry out no fewer than four (4) advanced nuclear reactor demonstration projects. This initiative would be dependent on the availability of appropriations to attain its objectives.This bill would direct the Department to construct a fast neutron-capable research facility. This is consistent with the Department's current plans to develop a Versatile Test Reactor.DOE acknowledges the need for a strategic plan and one is currently under development.Changes in Existing LawIn compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, changes in existing law made by the bill S. 903, as ordered reported, are shown as follows (existing law proposed to be omitted is enclosed in black brackets, new matter is printed in italic, existing law in which no change is proposed is presented in roman):TITLE 40--PUBLIC BUILDINGS, PROPERTY, AND WORKSThe full text of the report is found at: https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/senate-report/114/1?s=2&#38;r=15TARGETED NEWS SERVICE, Harwood Place, Springfield, Virginia, USA: Myron Struck, editor; 703/304-1897; editor@targetednews.com; https://targetednews.com-1409822Load-Date: October 3, 2019End of Document

China Took an Advantage of iPhone hack to Target Muslim CommunityStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 3, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 425 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyIt involved a small group of websites aiming to infect visitors' devices to gain access to their private information, including live location data and encrypted information on apps like on WhatsApp, iMessage and Telegram. The company hasn't publicly addressed Google's account of the hack since the news broke earlier this week."This indicated a group making a sustained effort to hack the users of iPhones in certain communities over a period of at least two years", said Beer.While the Google team only reported iPhone users being targeted by this attack, sources familiar with the matter told Forbes that devices using Google and Microsoft operating systems were also targeted by these same sites. Apple fixed the vulnerabilities in iOS 12.1.4 in February, within a week after Google privately notified the iPhone maker of the flaws. But the scale of the attacks signaled the involvement of a state actor. Google found five different iPhone exploit chains which operates in a similar way. "Microsoft has a strong commitment to investigate reported security issues and, should new information be disclosed, we will take appropriate action as needed to help keep customers protected".According to Forbes, the two-year campaign which had previously been believed to be aimed exclusively iOS actually morphed during the course of the two-year attack to reflect the gadget ownership of the target group. Sources gathered by Forbes reveal that devices running Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows operating system were also targeted in what Google described as an "indiscriminate" attack.Transfer: PSG, Barcelona end negotiations over Neymar dealThis is the ideal opportunity to prove he can be a successor to five-time winners Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. However, despite failing to secure a return to La Liga, Neymar is said to be committed to PSG for the season ahead.Many non-Uyghurs could also have been affected by the attack."The Chinese government has been systematically targeting the Uighur population for surveillance and imprisonment for years".Zack Whittaker ofTechCrunch, who first reported the focus of the attack on the Uighur Muslim community in Xinjiang province, said "the websites were part of a state-backed attack - likely [by] China - created to target the Uighur community". And hackers updated their methodology overtime on the basis of technological usage of the Uyghur community. The Chinese administration has been tracking the movements of Uighur people via widespread surveillance cameras with facial recognition.Load-Date: September 3, 2019End of Document

Telephone scammers are still targeting Carnegie Mellon's international studentsThe Tartan: Carnegie Mellon UniversitySeptember 22, 2019 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 803 wordsByline: Marika YangBodyIn the last several months, international students at Carnegie Mellon University have been targeted by telephone scams attempting to extract personal and financial information. They have been called "sophisticated" scams by University Police Chief Thomas Ogden for their methods and attention to detail.While the specifics of each scam vary case by case, they have several commonalities. In all cases reported to University Police, the victims were Chinese international students."Asian students [are] being contacted by what appears to be the Chinese government," said Chief of Police Thomas Odgen in an interview with The Tartan. Scammers "typically say that they're from the Chinese Embassy in New York, that they're sending American police to arrest [them]," Odgen says.In some cases, the calls appear to come from the Chinese Embassy, while in another, the caller claimed to be from a Chinese law enforcement agency. Victims are told that to prevent arrest or deportation, they must transfer a specific amount of money into an international bank account."They are very professional criminals, and keep students on the line for hours," said Lieutenant Joseph Meyers.In each case, University Police have contacted Homeland Security or the local FBI bureau. University Police used official communications in Jan. to report the first case of this nature to students. They informed students that "this is not an isolated incident. We've learned that calls pretending to come from the Chinese Embassy or U.S. government agencies are occurring nationwide."The most recent case was reported on reported on Sept. 11, after a student received a call from a person claiming to be from the Chinese consulate who demanded money. Because the victim was instructed to transfer funds into the international bank account via wire transfer, University Police hopes Homeland Security and Chinese law officials can do something to track the funds.University Police cannot confirm whether the cases all come from the same source, but they believe that they all originate in China. They say students and the elderly are the most vulnerable to these scams.There are several reasons why international students might be targeted. As students away from their home country and family, they need to have access to funds for emergencies, and scam criminals are aware of this. Also, because the U.S. is not their home country, they may not be completely familiar with particular laws or methods of law enforcement.Due to the high volume of international students at Carnegie Mellon, University Police hopes to get the message out to as many students on campus as possible. Organizations such as the Office of International Education and the Graduate Student Assembly have sent out multiple informative notifications since the scams began occurring."We have been made aware that graduate students were targeted by these scams," said GSA President Dacen Waters. "There was an increased volume of these scams around the beginning of the academic year. The timing makes me think that it is something targeted, trying to take advantage of students who have just arrived."Students are not the only individuals vulnerable to these attacks. Mei-Yu Wang, a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Physics, has received calls claiming to be from the Chinese Embassy."I've [received] tons of calls every few days from the China Embassy," said Wang. The calls were "to pick up a package. I just hung up immediately because I'm not from China, I'm from Taiwan," Wang mentions. Since she identified the call as a scam right away, she did not report the incident.While these sophisticated scams have become more common, students may also be subject to other types of scams. Wang received a phone call telling her she owed money to her credit card company. She began to worry and stayed on the phone, but when the caller could not identify which credit card with enough specificity, she grew suspicious and hung up. She spoke with her husband about their credit card company and determined that it had been a scam."For the general issue of phishing scams, the best defense is awareness. This is why, in my opinion, incoming students were targeted so strongly," said Waters. "The GSA is actively working together with [Graduate Education Office, OIE] and other offices to improve the flow of information and resources to incoming graduate students, particularly international students.""We want to get the word out that governments will not call you. The only people that would call you are bill collectors," said Chief Ogden, explaining that government agencies communicate through physical formal documents with a formal letterhead. "We're not typical police, we're your police. If [students] aren't comfortable with police, go to student affairs."Load-Date: September 22, 2019End of Document

World in Review: OCT 22The Leader: Elmhurst CollegeOctober 22, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 799 wordsBodyBlizzard faces backlash after suspending gamerNicholas RedmondNEWS REPORTERGaming giant Activision Blizzard suspended professional eSports gamer Ng Wai Chung October 8 for six months after he showed support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong against China.China and Hong Kong have been in crossfires recently due to people in Hong Kong protesting a proposed extradition bill and demanding major reform throughout the city and country governments. The New York Times reported that the bill has been withdrawn, but the protests persist because of a fear of a growing overreach of the Chinese government on Hong Kong and have become increasingly violent with police using live bullets on protesters.During a post-Hearthstone Grandmasters gamers livestream, Chung said, "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution for our times," but not before his teammates ducked under their table.Activision Blizzard, an American gaming company, but one that is partially owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent, suspended Chung and his teammates from competitions for a year. The company also revoked Chung's prize money."I feel like the punishment for me is too harsh. I believe they ban me because of the pressure from China," said Chung to Newsweek.The company's China branch released a statement on the country's version of Twitter, Weibo, which translated to, "We are very angered and disappointed at what happened at the event and do not condone it in any way. We also highly object the spreading of personal political beliefs in this manner ... We will always respect and defend the pride of our country."Blizzard's actions were soon met with protests claiming that the gaming company were favoring China's money over freedom of speech.Employees of Blizzard staged a walkout October 9 protesting the company's decision, as reported by The Daily Beast."Not everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened," tweeted eSports personality Kevin Hovdestad.College Hearthstone players also joined in the protest, posting "Free Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz" posters online.After the backlash, including a bipartisan letter from Congress, the Blizzard company took to Twitter, saying, "The specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. [We] want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision."The Verge reported that the company also reduced Chung and his teammates six months ban and returned the prize money back.Getty ImagesChina is harvesting organs of thousands, human rights lawyers saySyeda SameehaEDITOR-IN-CHIEFChina is facing accusations of harvesting organs from its ethnic and religious minorities.The China Tribunal, a coalition of the non-profit International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China, called on the U.N. on September 24 to investigate evidence that the country is killing and harvesting hearts, livers, kidneys, and skin from its ethnic minorities, the Uighurs Muslim population, as well as members of the banned religious movement Falon Gong.Human rights lawyer Hamid Sabi presented the China Tribunal's report to the U.N. Human Rights Council.The report stated the minorities were, "cut open while still alive for their kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs, cornea and skin to be removed and turned into commodities for sale," as mentioned by Business Insider.Extremely short wait times for organ transplants in China were also cited as evidence for forced harvesting in the report.This is not the first time China has been under fire for forced organ harvesting. According to the New York Post, the East Asian country has had a long history of procuring organs from living political enemies.China denied forced organ transplant practices and said they stopped organ transplants from prisoners in 2015, according to reports by The Independent.But in his address to the U.N., Sabi said forced organ transplants have been occurring "for years throughout China on a significant scale ... and continues today," as reported by Reuters.The current organ harvesting claims come after recent international outrage against reports that China is commiting a cultural genocide against Uighurs, an ethnic Muslim minority who live in the far western Xinjiang region.According to Vox, almost one million Uighurs Muslims have been placed in "reeducation centers" that force people to undergo indoctrination programs such as learning communist propaganda and giving thanks to the country's president Xi Jinping.The Washington Post also reported claims of waterboarding, torture, and even death as part of the reeducation centers, which many criticize as internment camps. However, the Chinese government also denied that the camps are forced placements and refers to them as voluntary vocational training systems intended to curb religious extremism.Load-Date: October 22, 2019End of Document

Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 11:00 ETBriefing.comOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 11:05 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc. All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 11278 wordsBodyHourly In Play (R)Updated: 08-Oct-19 11:00 ET10:36SMH Chipmakers pressured by blacklist news (116.72 -2.94)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (-2.8%) is a notable laggard today as chipmakers fall victim to selling interest after the U.S. added eight Chinese tech companies to a blacklist, which prevents these entities from doing business with U.S. companies without a special license. Video surveillance/facial recognition companies Hikvision and Dahua are among the newly blacklisted entities, alongside companies that work on artificial intelligence technologies.The news has caused broad-based weakness among chipmakers. There are currently 12 members of the SOX index showing losses of 3.0% or more. Interestingly, companies that are known for doing business with Hikvision and Dahua are not leading today's retreat. For instance, Intel (INTC 49.89, -0.73, -1.5%) is the second-best performer in the group while names like AMD (AMD 28.14, -0.79, -2.7%), NVIDIA (NVDA 177.96, -6.37, -3.4%), and Qualcomm (QCOM 73.53, -2.81, -3.6%) show losses between 2.7% and 3.6%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 47.90, -0.05, -0.1%) trades just below its flat line after notching a fresh record at the start of today's session. At this time, it may seem that the Taiwan-based company is shielded from being dragged into the conflict with China, but the contract chip manufacturer could see a decrease in orders if U.S. chipmakers are prevented from selling components to Chinese companies. Furthermore, there is also a risk that China could try to strengthen its grip over Taiwan and block TSM from fabricating chips for U.S. companies.10:18TALKX Market Briefing: Trade and growth concerns at heart of early selling interestIt's not a pretty picture in the stock market this morning. Every sector is lower, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 10% to 19.57, and the S&P 500 has dropped further below its 50-day moving average (2938.44).The negative price action is primarily a function of trade concerns, which ratcheted up following some awkward timing by the Department of Commerce in naming 19 Chinese governmental, and eight commercial, firms to its Entity List on the basis of their part in fostering human rights violations against Muslim ethnic minorities in China.That news hit last night and immediately created a diplomatic rift in front of this week's trade negotiations in Washington between senior U.S. and China trade officials. China for its part warned it will retaliate.Accordingly, a sense of nervousness ahead of those talks has fueled broad-based selling interest. The selling activity is predicated not just on a belief that the trade talks this week will be disappointing, but that the latest developments will keep a planned tariff rate increase from 25% to 30% on $250 billion worth of imported Chinese goods on track to be implemented October 15.The more general view of matters, and seemingly negative turn of events, is that the trade uncertainty is a negative for growth and earnings prospects alike.The biggest losers thus far are the financial (-1.8%), health care (-1.6%), information technology (-1.5%), and industrials (-1.4%) sectors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.1%; the S&P 500 is down 1.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.6%.10:10OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:WDC Oct 60 calls are seeing interest with 2560 contracts trading vs. open int of 1010, pushing implied vol up around 3 points to ~44%.

If the parties fail to arrive at any agreement or settlement within the 30 days, and if Aleafia initiates a formal claim for damages, the company intends to vigorously defend itself.

The latest development was a report that the US will blacklist 28 Chinese companies, which caused China to declare a retaliation. S&P Futures are trading around the 2930 area. After putting in a low of 2927.75, the market has once again signaled this area as a key support zone. The market capped out at 2950.00, which is a key resistance area.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong returned to action. Chinese markets traded higher all day, but in a relatively narrow range, before closing up 0.3%. The Shanghai held a bid following a weaker than expected Caixin Services PMI, coming in at 51.3, compared to consensus of 52.1. The disappointing print led to speculation of stimulus. The Nikkei finished the day 1% stronger following a drop in the yen against the dollar. The currency's weakness led to a strength in export stocks, with Tech names leading the way following better than expected results from Samsung.In Europe, the major bourses are mostly lower. These markets opened higher but the positive sentiment waned. Germany posted better than expected Industrial Production for August, rising 0.3%, beating expectations for a fall of 0.2%. There are also reports that Brexit talks are breaking down, which has weakened the British Pound. Like in Japan, the weaker currency has helped buoy the FTSE, which is unchanged on the day.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -5.010 yr Note: 1.54%USD/JPY: 107.10 -0.15EUR/USD: 1.0987 +0.0016Europe: FTSE 0.0% DAX -0.5% CAC -0.5%Asia: Hang Seng +0.3% Shanghai +0.3% Nikkei +1.0%Gold (1504.50 +0.10) Silver (17.55 +0.01) Crude (52.55 -0.20)18:07AZUL Azul S.A. reports Sept passenger traffic (RPKs) increased 31.0% yr/yr on a capacity increase of 30.8%, resulting in a load factor of 83.3% (36.97 -0.81)In the third quarter, consolidated RPKs increased 30.7% on a capacity increase of 29.3% year over year.18:03SBLK Star Bulk Carriers filed for ~1.54 mln share offering by selling shareholder Delphin Holdings (10.45 -0.02)17:27SDC SmileDirectClub offers statement on today's set of analyst initiations (13.49 -1.23)"Today's market reports reinforce the value of our business model, unit economics and mission to transform smiles through safe, affordable and consumer-first technology to an addressable market of approximately 500 million people worldwide.

The 100% owned Amaruq satellite deposit is located approx. 50 km northwest of the Meadowbank mine, which in turn is located approx. 110 km by road north of Baker Lake in the Kivalliq District of Nunavut, Canada. Development of the Amaruq project was approved in February 2017 by the company's Board of Directors as a satellite deposit to supply ore to the existing Meadowbank mill.Amaruq ore processing commenced in August 2019 using low-grade stockpiles. In the third quarter of 2019, production at the Meadowbank Complex totaled 48,869 ounces of gold, which included 13,588 ounces from Meadowbank and pre-commercial payable gold production at Amaruq of 35,281 ounces, compared to pre-commercial production guidance of 40,000 gold ounces. During the third quarter, mining activities at Amaruq continued to be affected by slower than expected dewatering activities. Given the slower than expected ramp up of mining activities, the company took the opportunity to accelerate planned maintenance to the milling and crushing circuits, which was originally scheduled for 2020. As a result, the mill was temporarily shut down in mid-September and is expected to restart on or about October 14.As a result, production guidance at the Meadowbank Complex for 2019 is now anticipated to be 200,000 ounces of gold (previous forecast of 230,000 ounces). Despite the lower forecast for the Meadowbank Complex, the company's FY19 production guidance of 1.75 mln ounces of gold remains unchanged.17:03ATR AptarGroup to acquire 49% equity interest in BTY, a Chinese color cosmetics packaging manufacturer (116.56 -0.77)AptarGroup has signed an agreement to acquire a 49% equity interest in three related BTY companies: Suzhou Hsing Kwang, Suqian Hsing Kwang, and Suzhou BTY, collectively referred to as BTY.

Co expects production to be at the mid-point of its original guidance of 28,000-31,000 boe/day and expects capital spending to be at mid-point of $195-$225 mln.Preliminary total company production for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019 averaged 29,600 boe/d with the month of September averaging 31,700 boe/d, compared to June's average of 27,400. The month of September production is nearly 88% oil, an increase from 86% in 2Q19.This improvement is primarily attributed to BRY'ss capital deployment to grow its California production. Preliminary California production, consisting of 100% Brent-based oil, for the quarter is approximately 22,900 bbl/d, an increase of 10.4% compared with last quarter and 17.7% with 3Q18.16:35HA Hawaiian Holdings reports Sept traffic (revenue passenger miles) +3% yr/yr on an increase of 0.7% in capacity (available seat miles); raises Q3 estimates for operating revenue per ASM (25.21 -0.49)Q3 update: Total traffic increased 2.7 percent on a decrease of 0.4 percent in capacity. Load factor increased 2.7 points to 87.8 percent.

These losses are primarily from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. At this time, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the scope of damage for these events, as well as the other global events. The company's estimate for these events is based on currently available information; actual losses from these events may vary materially from the estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations. The loss estimates exclude the operations of Watford Holdings. Pursuant to GAAP, the company consolidates the results of Watford in its financial statements, although it only owns approx. 11% of Watford's outstanding common equity.16:22WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 declined 0.5% on Monday in a session replete with trade speculation and indecision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD16:20QGEN Qiagen also announces CEO transition; CEO Peer M.

Video surveillance/facial recognition companies Hikvision and Dahua are among the newly blacklisted entities, alongside companies that work on artificial intelligence technologies.The news has caused broad-based weakness among chipmakers. There are currently 12 members of the SOX index showing losses of 3.0% or more. Interestingly, companies that are known for doing business with Hikvision and Dahua are not leading today's retreat. For instance, Intel (INTC 49.89, -0.73, -1.5%) is the second-best performer in the group while names like AMD (AMD 28.14, -0.79, -2.7%), NVIDIA (NVDA 177.96, -6.37, -3.4%), and Qualcomm (QCOM 73.53, -2.81, -3.6%) show losses between 2.7% and 3.6%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 47.90, -0.05, -0.1%) trades just below its flat line after notching a fresh record at the start of today's session. At this time, it may seem that the Taiwan-based company is shielded from being dragged into the conflict with China, but the contract chip manufacturer could see a decrease in orders if U.S. chipmakers are prevented from selling components to Chinese companies. Furthermore, there is also a risk that China could try to strengthen its grip over Taiwan and block TSM from fabricating chips for U.S. companies.10:18TALKX Market Briefing: Trade and growth concerns at heart of early selling interestIt's not a pretty picture in the stock market this morning. Every sector is lower, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 10% to 19.57, and the S&P 500 has dropped further below its 50-day moving average (2938.44).The negative price action is primarily a function of trade concerns, which ratcheted up following some awkward timing by the Department of Commerce in naming 19 Chinese governmental, and eight commercial, firms to its Entity List on the basis of their part in fostering human rights violations against Muslim ethnic minorities in China.That news hit last night and immediately created a diplomatic rift in front of this week's trade negotiations in Washington between senior U.S. and China trade officials. China for its part warned it will retaliate.Accordingly, a sense of nervousness ahead of those talks has fueled broad-based selling interest. The selling activity is predicated not just on a belief that the trade talks this week will be disappointing, but that the latest developments will keep a planned tariff rate increase from 25% to 30% on $250 billion worth of imported Chinese goods on track to be implemented October 15.The more general view of matters, and seemingly negative turn of events, is that the trade uncertainty is a negative for growth and earnings prospects alike.The biggest losers thus far are the financial (-1.8%), health care (-1.6%), information technology (-1.5%), and industrials (-1.4%) sectors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.1%; the S&P 500 is down 1.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.6%.10:10OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:WDC Oct 60 calls are seeing interest with 2560 contracts trading vs. open int of 1010, pushing implied vol up around 3 points to ~44%.

The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96.

As a large shareholder of Aleafia, Aphria made good faith efforts to ensure continuation of the Agreement understanding it was in the best interest of all parties involved.

If the parties fail to arrive at any agreement or settlement within the 30 days, and if Aleafia initiates a formal claim for damages, the company intends to vigorously defend itself.

Looking towards the fiscal year 2020, we are still on track for strong contributions from our 5G deployments, resulting in growth and expanded EBITDA margins."17:08AEM Agnico-Eagle Mines reports achievement of commercial production at Amarug satellite deposit and offers production updates (54.02 -0.31)Commercial production was achieved at the company's Amaruq satellite deposit at the Meadowbank Complex on September 30. The 100% owned Amaruq satellite deposit is located approx. 50 km northwest of the Meadowbank mine, which in turn is located approx. 110 km by road north of Baker Lake in the Kivalliq District of Nunavut, Canada. Development of the Amaruq project was approved in February 2017 by the company's Board of Directors as a satellite deposit to supply ore to the existing Meadowbank mill.Amaruq ore processing commenced in August 2019 using low-grade stockpiles. In the third quarter of 2019, production at the Meadowbank Complex totaled 48,869 ounces of gold, which included 13,588 ounces from Meadowbank and pre-commercial payable gold production at Amaruq of 35,281 ounces, compared to pre-commercial production guidance of 40,000 gold ounces. During the third quarter, mining activities at Amaruq continued to be affected by slower than expected dewatering activities. Given the slower than expected ramp up of mining activities, the company took the opportunity to accelerate planned maintenance to the milling and crushing circuits, which was originally scheduled for 2020. As a result, the mill was temporarily shut down in mid-September and is expected to restart on or about October 14.As a result, production guidance at the Meadowbank Complex for 2019 is now anticipated to be 200,000 ounces of gold (previous forecast of 230,000 ounces). Despite the lower forecast for the Meadowbank Complex, the company's FY19 production guidance of 1.75 mln ounces of gold remains unchanged.17:03ATR AptarGroup to acquire 49% equity interest in BTY, a Chinese color cosmetics packaging manufacturer (116.56 -0.77)AptarGroup has signed an agreement to acquire a 49% equity interest in three related BTY companies: Suzhou Hsing Kwang, Suqian Hsing Kwang, and Suzhou BTY, collectively referred to as BTY.

Financial details will be disclosed upon successful completion of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2019, and the purchase will be funded with available cash on hand.16:38BRY Berry Petroleum reaffirms 2019 annual production and capital spending guidance (9.28 -0.05)BRY reaffirms its full year production and capital spending guidance for 2019. Co expects production to be at the mid-point of its original guidance of 28,000-31,000 boe/day and expects capital spending to be at mid-point of $195-$225 mln.Preliminary total company production for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019 averaged 29,600 boe/d with the month of September averaging 31,700 boe/d, compared to June's average of 27,400. The month of September production is nearly 88% oil, an increase from 86% in 2Q19.This improvement is primarily attributed to BRY'ss capital deployment to grow its California production. Preliminary California production, consisting of 100% Brent-based oil, for the quarter is approximately 22,900 bbl/d, an increase of 10.4% compared with last quarter and 17.7% with 3Q18.16:35HA Hawaiian Holdings reports Sept traffic (revenue passenger miles) +3% yr/yr on an increase of 0.7% in capacity (available seat miles); raises Q3 estimates for operating revenue per ASM (25.21 -0.49)Q3 update: Total traffic increased 2.7 percent on a decrease of 0.4 percent in capacity. Load factor increased 2.7 points to 87.8 percent. Company also raised its estimates for operating revenue per ASM due to better than expected yields in long-haul markets, particularly in its International entity to down 0.5% - up 0.5% from down 1.5-4.5%; narrowed its estimates for operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and non-recurring items; narrowed its estimates for gallons of jet fuel consumed; and lowered its estimates for economic fuel cost per gallon.16:34ACGL Arch Capital estimates $65-75 mln of catastrophe losses related to third quarter events (41.63 -0.23)Arch Capital expects to report third quarter 2019 pre-tax catastrophe losses of approx. $65-75 mln, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums. These losses are primarily from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. At this time, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the scope of damage for these events, as well as the other global events. The company's estimate for these events is based on currently available information; actual losses from these events may vary materially from the estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations. The loss estimates exclude the operations of Watford Holdings. Pursuant to GAAP, the company consolidates the results of Watford in its financial statements, although it only owns approx. 11% of Watford's outstanding common equity.16:22WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 declined 0.5% on Monday in a session replete with trade speculation and indecision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD16:20QGEN Qiagen also announces CEO transition; CEO Peer M.

Video surveillance/facial recognition companies Hikvision and Dahua are among the newly blacklisted entities, alongside companies that work on artificial intelligence technologies.The news has caused broad-based weakness among chipmakers. There are currently 12 members of the SOX index showing losses of 3.0% or more. Interestingly, companies that are known for doing business with Hikvision and Dahua are not leading today's retreat. For instance, Intel (INTC 49.89, -0.73, -1.5%) is the second-best performer in the group while names like AMD (AMD 28.14, -0.79, -2.7%), NVIDIA (NVDA 177.96, -6.37, -3.4%), and Qualcomm (QCOM 73.53, -2.81, -3.6%) show losses between 2.7% and 3.6%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 47.90, -0.05, -0.1%) trades just below its flat line after notching a fresh record at the start of today's session. At this time, it may seem that the Taiwan-based company is shielded from being dragged into the conflict with China, but the contract chip manufacturer could see a decrease in orders if U.S. chipmakers are prevented from selling components to Chinese companies. Furthermore, there is also a risk that China could try to strengthen its grip over Taiwan and block TSM from fabricating chips for U.S. companies.10:18TALKX Market Briefing: Trade and growth concerns at heart of early selling interestIt's not a pretty picture in the stock market this morning. Every sector is lower, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 10% to 19.57, and the S&P 500 has dropped further below its 50-day moving average (2938.44).The negative price action is primarily a function of trade concerns, which ratcheted up following some awkward timing by the Department of Commerce in naming 19 Chinese governmental, and eight commercial, firms to its Entity List on the basis of their part in fostering human rights violations against Muslim ethnic minorities in China.That news hit last night and immediately created a diplomatic rift in front of this week's trade negotiations in Washington between senior U.S. and China trade officials. China for its part warned it will retaliate.Accordingly, a sense of nervousness ahead of those talks has fueled broad-based selling interest. The selling activity is predicated not just on a belief that the trade talks this week will be disappointing, but that the latest developments will keep a planned tariff rate increase from 25% to 30% on $250 billion worth of imported Chinese goods on track to be implemented October 15.The more general view of matters, and seemingly negative turn of events, is that the trade uncertainty is a negative for growth and earnings prospects alike.The biggest losers thus far are the financial (-1.8%), health care (-1.6%), information technology (-1.5%), and industrials (-1.4%) sectors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.1%; the S&P 500 is down 1.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.6%.10:10OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:WDC Oct 60 calls are seeing interest with 2560 contracts trading vs. open int of 1010, pushing implied vol up around 3 points to ~44%.

The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96.

The latest development was a report that the US will blacklist 28 Chinese companies, which caused China to declare a retaliation. S&P Futures are trading around the 2930 area. After putting in a low of 2927.75, the market has once again signaled this area as a key support zone. The market capped out at 2950.00, which is a key resistance area.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong returned to action. Chinese markets traded higher all day, but in a relatively narrow range, before closing up 0.3%. The Shanghai held a bid following a weaker than expected Caixin Services PMI, coming in at 51.3, compared to consensus of 52.1. The disappointing print led to speculation of stimulus.

The 100% owned Amaruq satellite deposit is located approx. 50 km northwest of the Meadowbank mine, which in turn is located approx. 110 km by road north of Baker Lake in the Kivalliq District of Nunavut, Canada. Development of the Amaruq project was approved in February 2017 by the company's Board of Directors as a satellite deposit to supply ore to the existing Meadowbank mill.Amaruq ore processing commenced in August 2019 using low-grade stockpiles. In the third quarter of 2019, production at the Meadowbank Complex totaled 48,869 ounces of gold, which included 13,588 ounces from Meadowbank and pre-commercial payable gold production at Amaruq of 35,281 ounces, compared to pre-commercial production guidance of 40,000 gold ounces. During the third quarter, mining activities at Amaruq continued to be affected by slower than expected dewatering activities. Given the slower than expected ramp up of mining activities, the company took the opportunity to accelerate planned maintenance to the milling and crushing circuits, which was originally scheduled for 2020. As a result, the mill was temporarily shut down in mid-September and is expected to restart on or about October 14.As a result, production guidance at the Meadowbank Complex for 2019 is now anticipated to be 200,000 ounces of gold (previous forecast of 230,000 ounces). Despite the lower forecast for the Meadowbank Complex, the company's FY19 production guidance of 1.75 mln ounces of gold remains unchanged.17:03ATR AptarGroup to acquire 49% equity interest in BTY, a Chinese color cosmetics packaging manufacturer (116.56 -0.77)AptarGroup has signed an agreement to acquire a 49% equity interest in three related BTY companies: Suzhou Hsing Kwang, Suqian Hsing Kwang, and Suzhou BTY, collectively referred to as BTY.

Co expects production to be at the mid-point of its original guidance of 28,000-31,000 boe/day and expects capital spending to be at mid-point of $195-$225 mln.Preliminary total company production for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019 averaged 29,600 boe/d with the month of September averaging 31,700 boe/d, compared to June's average of 27,400. The month of September production is nearly 88% oil, an increase from 86% in 2Q19.This improvement is primarily attributed to BRY'ss capital deployment to grow its California production. Preliminary California production, consisting of 100% Brent-based oil, for the quarter is approximately 22,900 bbl/d, an increase of 10.4% compared with last quarter and 17.7% with 3Q18.16:35HA Hawaiian Holdings reports Sept traffic (revenue passenger miles) +3% yr/yr on an increase of 0.7% in capacity (available seat miles); raises Q3 estimates for operating revenue per ASM (25.21 -0.49)Q3 update: Total traffic increased 2.7 percent on a decrease of 0.4 percent in capacity. Load factor increased 2.7 points to 87.8 percent. Company also raised its estimates for operating revenue per ASM due to better than expected yields in long-haul markets, particularly in its International entity to down 0.5% - up 0.5% from down 1.5-4.5%; narrowed its estimates for operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and non-recurring items; narrowed its estimates for gallons of jet fuel consumed; and lowered its estimates for economic fuel cost per gallon.16:34ACGL Arch Capital estimates $65-75 mln of catastrophe losses related to third quarter events (41.63 -0.23)Arch Capital expects to report third quarter 2019 pre-tax catastrophe losses of approx. $65-75 mln, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums. These losses are primarily from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. At this time, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the scope of damage for these events, as well as the other global events. The company's estimate for these events is based on currently available information; actual losses from these events may vary materially from the estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations. The loss estimates exclude the operations of Watford Holdings. Pursuant to GAAP, the company consolidates the results of Watford in its financial statements, although it only owns approx. 11% of Watford's outstanding common equity.16:22WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 declined 0.5% on Monday in a session replete with trade speculation and indecision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD16:20QGEN Qiagen also announces CEO transition; CEO Peer M.

Shares in Baidu  were seen 1.95% lower at $99.49 while JD.com  slipped 1.87% to $28.31 each.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters in Washington Monday that a U.S. plan to force the de-listing of China stocks on U.S. exchanges is "not on the table" heading into trade talks with senior officials from Beijing later this week at the White House."What we're looking at, actually, is investor protection, U.S. investor protections (as well as) transparency and compliance with a number of laws," Kudlow said.The Bloomberg report followed last night's decision by the U.S. Commerce Department to blacklist several China-based tech companies that could affect this week's crucial trade talks in Washington.The Commerce Department unveiled the blacklist late Monday, targeting China-based tech firms operating in the artificial intelligence space that were deemed to have been "implicated in human rights violations ... against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups."The censure prevents the eight firms from buying components from U.S. firms without prior government permission, but perhaps more importantly comes just days ahead of high-level trade talks between the world's two largest economies in Washington and could spark reprisals against U.S firms from Beijing."The U.S. Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (-1.7%), and Russell 2000 (-1.7%) also posted sizable losses to close near session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department placed 28 more Chinese firms on its Entity List for their role in fostering violations of human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied the allegations and warned about possible retaliation, with a report suggesting China could even leave this week's discussions one day early.Selling pressure appeared to level off after China's Global Times reported that China remains sincere in reaching a comprehensive deal and intends on proceeding "calmly." Stocks then cut losses after Fed Chair Powell said the Fed plans on expanding its balance sheet, but quickly faded into the close on news that the U.S. will impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to the human rights abuses.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower in a risk-off session. Nine sectors lost at least 1.0%, including a 2.0% drop in the financials sector. The real estate sector (-0.5%) declined the least.A disappointing outcome in trade talks was likely being priced in but also the likelihood that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15, as planned. In other words, the trade uncertainty continued to dampen the growth outlook for the economy and corporate earnings.Many of the China-sensitive semiconductor stocks, including Ambarella (AMBA 51.79, -5.43, -9.5%), underperformed as many of these companies derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.1% on Tuesday.U.S. Treasuries ended a volatile session on a higher note amid growth concerns and an unexpected decline in producer prices for September.

The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, the JOLTS - Job Openings report for August, the Wholesale Inventories report for August, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +x% YTDS&P 500 +x% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +f% YTDRussell 2000 +f% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 686/1926. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 666/2420.15:25 ETDow -167.12 at 26310.9, Nasdaq -81.80 at 7874.5, S&P -27.29 at 2911.54[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market's rebound attempt has run into another obstacle following a report that the U.S. will impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to the human rights abuses.

The S&P 500 is down 0.5% after being down as much as 1.4%.In other words, the size of the balance sheet is expected to increase, but Mr. Powell said this "should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchases programs that we deployed after the financial crisis."At the same time, Fed Chair Powell's speech did not suggest that an October rate cut is not likely, keeping the market in good spirits about its high expectations for a 25-basis points cut.

Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment.

Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs.

Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion.

Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97.

Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (-1.7%), and Russell 2000 (-1.7%) also posted sizable losses to close near session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department placed 28 more Chinese firms on its Entity List for their role in fostering violations of human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied the allegations and warned about possible retaliation, with a report suggesting China could even leave this week's discussions one day early.Selling pressure appeared to level off after China's Global Times reported that China remains sincere in reaching a comprehensive deal and intends on proceeding "calmly." Stocks then cut losses after Fed Chair Powell said the Fed plans on expanding its balance sheet, but quickly faded into the close on news that the U.S. will impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to the human rights abuses.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower in a risk-off session. Nine sectors lost at least 1.0%, including a 2.0% drop in the financials sector. The real estate sector (-0.5%) declined the least.A disappointing outcome in trade talks was likely being priced in but also the likelihood that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15, as planned. In other words, the trade uncertainty continued to dampen the growth outlook for the economy and corporate earnings.Many of the China-sensitive semiconductor stocks, including Ambarella (AMBA 51.79, -5.43, -9.5%), underperformed as many of these companies derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.1% on Tuesday.U.S. Treasuries ended a volatile session on a higher note amid growth concerns and an unexpected decline in producer prices for September. The 2-yr yield declined four basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.54%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 99.13. WTI crude declined 0.3%, or $0.13, to $52.66/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, the JOLTS - Job Openings report for August, the Wholesale Inventories report for August, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +17.9% YTDS&P 500 +15.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.2% YTDRussell 2000 +9.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 686/1926. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 666/2420.15:25 ETDow -167.12 at 26310.9, Nasdaq -81.80 at 7874.5, S&P -27.29 at 2911.54[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market's rebound attempt has run into another obstacle following a report that the U.S. will impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to the human rights abuses. The S&P 500 is down 0.9%, the Dow is down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.0%.Reviewing the S&P 500 sectors shows the real estate sector (+0.1%) as today's lone group in the green. The financials (-1.5%), materials (-1.1%), health care (-1.1%), and information technology (-1.1%) sectors are down over 1.0%.WTI crude settled down $0.13 (-0.3%) to $52.66/bbl.15:00 ETDow -80.04 at 26397.98, Nasdaq -44.50 at 7911.8, S&P -17.20 at 2921.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has pared losses and is now trading at session highs after Fed Chair Powell said the Fed "will soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time." The S&P 500 is down 0.5% after being down as much as 1.4%.In other words, the size of the balance sheet is expected to increase, but Mr. Powell said this "should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchases programs that we deployed after the financial crisis."At the same time, Fed Chair Powell's speech did not suggest that an October rate cut is not likely, keeping the market in good spirits about its high expectations for a 25-basis points cut. The fed-funds sensitive 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.44%, and the benchmark 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.55%.14:30 ETDow -154.47 at 26323.55, Nasdaq -74.32 at 7881.98, S&P -25.87 at 2912.96[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have drifted lower off their levels from half an hour ago, though still stand firmly within their daily range.Top decliners in the S&P 500 include Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 16.51, -2.16, -11.57%) -- after analysts at Goldman downgraded the stock to a "Sell" rating while also trimming their price target on the name to $16 from $54, Waters (WAT 209.69, -13.79, -6.17%) -- after med-tech peer Qiagen's (QGEN 25.33, -6.73, -20.99%) revenue warning, executive departure, and Boston Scientific (BSX 37.92, -2.43, -6.02%) -- also down in sympathy to QGEN's news.Conversely, airliner American Airlines (AAL 26.64, +0.81, +3.14%) sits atop the index.14:00 ETDow -146.46 at 26331.56, Nasdaq -67.04 at 7889.26, S&P -24.01 at 2914.82[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 cracked a session high, the Nasdaq Composite made an afternoon high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average mostly stayed put in the last half hour. The trio now stand -0.82%, -0.84%, and -0.55%, respectively.Gold futures settled lost $0.50 (-0.0%) on Tuesday to $1,503.90/oz, giving up afternoon gains which were fueled in part by trade uncertainty, after the greenback surged to a near one-week high.The U.S. Dollar Index holds near a one-week high, +0.2%, at 99.17.13:30 ETDow -145.51 at 26332.51, Nasdaq -71.74 at 7884.56, S&P -24.73 at 2914.1[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are attempting to return to session highs in recent action with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosting the shallowest losses, down 0.55%.The worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.61, -1.16, -2.43%), Dow (DOW 44.34, -0.83, -1.84%), and IBM (IBM 139.01, -2.27, -1.61%) despite a dearth of corporate news.Conversely, big box retail giant Walmart (WMT 118.12, +0.89, +0.76%) sits atop the index.The DJIA gives back all of Friday's recovery, now -2.17% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.413% on a bid-to-cover of 2.43.12:55 ETDow -151.85 at 26326.17, Nasdaq -69.41 at 7886.89, S&P -24.70 at 2914.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages on Wall Street are down noticeably today after the U.S. placed 28 more Chinese organizations on its trade blacklist. The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:30 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.[Correction: a previous version of this comment indicated Fed Chair Powell would speak at 1:50 p.m. ET. This has been corrected to 1:30 p.m. ET]12:30 ETDow -227.68 at 26250.34, Nasdaq -83.00 at 7873.3, S&P -31.08 at 2907.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 1.1% alongside the tech-sensitive Nasdaq.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96.

On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97.

Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (-1.7%), and Russell 2000 (-1.7%) also posted sizable losses to close near session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department placed 28 more Chinese firms on its Entity List for their role in fostering violations of human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied the allegations and warned about possible retaliation, with a report suggesting China could even leave this week's discussions one day early.Selling pressure appeared to level off after China's Global Times reported that China remains sincere in reaching a comprehensive deal and intends on proceeding "calmly." Stocks then cut losses after Fed Chair Powell said the Fed plans on expanding its balance sheet, but quickly faded into the close on news that the U.S. will impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to the human rights abuses.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower in a risk-off session. Nine sectors lost at least 1.0%, including a 2.0% drop in the financials sector. The real estate sector (-0.5%) declined the least.A disappointing outcome in trade talks was likely being priced in but also the likelihood that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15, as planned. In other words, the trade uncertainty continued to dampen the growth outlook for the economy and corporate earnings.Many of the China-sensitive semiconductor stocks, including Ambarella (AMBA 51.79, -5.43, -9.5%), underperformed as many of these companies derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.1% on Tuesday.U.S. Treasuries ended a volatile session on a higher note amid growth concerns and an unexpected decline in producer prices for September. The 2-yr yield declined four basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.54%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 99.13. WTI crude declined 0.3%, or $0.13, to $52.66/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, the JOLTS - Job Openings report for August, the Wholesale Inventories report for August, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +17.9% YTDS&P 500 +15.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +12.2% YTDRussell 2000 +9.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 686/1926. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 666/2420.15:25 ETDow -167.12 at 26310.9, Nasdaq -81.80 at 7874.5, S&P -27.29 at 2911.54[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market's rebound attempt has run into another obstacle following a report that the U.S. will impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to the human rights abuses. The S&P 500 is down 0.9%, the Dow is down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.0%.Reviewing the S&P 500 sectors shows the real estate sector (+0.1%) as today's lone group in the green. The financials (-1.5%), materials (-1.1%), health care (-1.1%), and information technology (-1.1%) sectors are down over 1.0%.WTI crude settled down $0.13 (-0.3%) to $52.66/bbl.15:00 ETDow -80.04 at 26397.98, Nasdaq -44.50 at 7911.8, S&P -17.20 at 2921.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has pared losses and is now trading at session highs after Fed Chair Powell said the Fed "will soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time." The S&P 500 is down 0.5% after being down as much as 1.4%.In other words, the size of the balance sheet is expected to increase, but Mr. Powell said this "should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchases programs that we deployed after the financial crisis."At the same time, Fed Chair Powell's speech did not suggest that an October rate cut is not likely, keeping the market in good spirits about its high expectations for a 25-basis points cut. The fed-funds sensitive 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.44%, and the benchmark 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.55%.14:30 ETDow -154.47 at 26323.55, Nasdaq -74.32 at 7881.98, S&P -25.87 at 2912.96[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have drifted lower off their levels from half an hour ago, though still stand firmly within their daily range.Top decliners in the S&P 500 include Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 16.51, -2.16, -11.57%) -- after analysts at Goldman downgraded the stock to a "Sell" rating while also trimming their price target on the name to $16 from $54, Waters (WAT 209.69, -13.79, -6.17%) -- after med-tech peer Qiagen's (QGEN 25.33, -6.73, -20.99%) revenue warning, executive departure, and Boston Scientific (BSX 37.92, -2.43, -6.02%) -- also down in sympathy to QGEN's news.Conversely, airliner American Airlines (AAL 26.64, +0.81, +3.14%) sits atop the index.14:00 ETDow -146.46 at 26331.56, Nasdaq -67.04 at 7889.26, S&P -24.01 at 2914.82[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 cracked a session high, the Nasdaq Composite made an afternoon high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average mostly stayed put in the last half hour. The trio now stand -0.82%, -0.84%, and -0.55%, respectively.Gold futures settled lost $0.50 (-0.0%) on Tuesday to $1,503.90/oz, giving up afternoon gains which were fueled in part by trade uncertainty, after the greenback surged to a near one-week high.The U.S. Dollar Index holds near a one-week high, +0.2%, at 99.17.13:30 ETDow -145.51 at 26332.51, Nasdaq -71.74 at 7884.56, S&P -24.73 at 2914.1[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are attempting to return to session highs in recent action with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosting the shallowest losses, down 0.55%.The worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.61, -1.16, -2.43%), Dow (DOW 44.34, -0.83, -1.84%), and IBM (IBM 139.01, -2.27, -1.61%) despite a dearth of corporate news.Conversely, big box retail giant Walmart (WMT 118.12, +0.89, +0.76%) sits atop the index.The DJIA gives back all of Friday's recovery, now -2.17% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.413% on a bid-to-cover of 2.43.12:55 ETDow -151.85 at 26326.17, Nasdaq -69.41 at 7886.89, S&P -24.70 at 2914.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages on Wall Street are down noticeably today after the U.S. placed 28 more Chinese organizations on its trade blacklist. The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:30 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.[Correction: a previous version of this comment indicated Fed Chair Powell would speak at 1:50 p.m. ET. This has been corrected to 1:30 p.m. ET]12:30 ETDow -227.68 at 26250.34, Nasdaq -83.00 at 7873.3, S&P -31.08 at 2907.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 1.1% alongside the tech-sensitive Nasdaq.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted.

The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve.

China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain. The index rallied to begin the day but backed off its session high after the release of a weaker than expected Caixin Services PMI (actual 51.3; expected 52.1; last 52.1). Overnight reports indicated that U.S. officials added 28 Chinese companies, including Hikvision, to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.

German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that a Brexit deal is "overwhelmingly unlikely" if Northern Ireland doesn't stay in the customs union.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion.

Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97.

Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (-1.7%), and Russell 2000 (-1.7%) also posted sizable losses to close near session lows. The U.S. Commerce Department placed 28 more Chinese firms on its Entity List for their role in fostering violations of human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied the allegations and warned about possible retaliation, with a report suggesting China could even leave this week's discussions one day early. Selling pressure appeared to level off after China's Global Times reported that China remains sincere in reaching a comprehensive deal and intends on proceeding "calmly." Stocks then cut losses after Fed Chair Powell said the Fed plans on expanding its balance sheet, but quickly faded into the close on news that the U.S. will impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to the human rights abuses.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower in a risk-off session. Nine sectors lost at least 1.0%, including a 2.0% drop in the financials sector. The real estate sector (-0.5%) declined the least. A disappointing outcome in trade talks was likely being priced in but also the likelihood that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15, as planned. In other words, the trade uncertainty continued to dampen the growth outlook for the economy and corporate earnings. Many of the China-sensitive semiconductor stocks, including Ambarella (AMBA 51.79, -5.43, -9.5%), underperformed as many of these companies derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.1% on Tuesday. U.S. Treasuries ended a volatile session on a higher note amid growth concerns and an unexpected decline in producer prices for September. The 2-yr yield declined four basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.54%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 99.13. WTI crude declined 0.3%, or $0.13, to $52.66/bbl. Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:• The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.• The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, the JOLTS - Job Openings report for August, the Wholesale Inventories report for August, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.• Nasdaq Composite +17.9% YTD• S&P 500 +15.1% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +12.2% YTD• Russell 2000 +9.2% YTDNASDAQ - 666 - 2420 - 1.9 blnNYSE - 686 - 1926 - 805.7 mlnDJ30 - -313.98 - 26164.04NASDAQ - -132.52 - 7823.78SP500 - -45.73 - 2893.1U.S. imposes visa restrictions on Chinese officials linked to abuses - Oct 08 - 15:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market's rebound attempt has run into another obstacle following a report that the U.S. will impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to the human rights abuses. The S&P 500 is down 0.9%, the Dow is down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.0%.Reviewing the S&P 500 sectors shows the real estate sector (+0.1%) as today's lone group in the green. The financials (-1.5%), materials (-1.1%), health care (-1.1%), and information technology (-1.1%) sectors are down over 1.0%. WTI crude settled down $0.13 (-0.3%) to $52.66/bbl. NASDAQ - 808 - 2240 - 1.5 blnNYSE - 853 - 1862 - 439.5 mlnDJ30 - -167.12 - 26310.9NASDAQ - -81.80 - 7874.5SP500 - -27.29 - 2911.54Market pushes to session highs after comments from Powell - Oct 08 - 15:00 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has pared losses and is now trading at session highs after Fed Chair Powell said the Fed "will soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time." The S&P 500 is down 0.5% after being down as much as 1.4%. In other words, the size of the balance sheet is expected to increase, but Mr. Powell said this "should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchases programs that we deployed after the financial crisis."At the same time, Fed Chair Powell's speech did not suggest that an October rate cut is not likely, keeping the market in good spirits about its high expectations for a 25-basis points cut. The fed-funds sensitive 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.44%, and the benchmark 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.55%. NASDAQ - 819 - 2233 - 1.3 blnNYSE - 873 - 1898 - 400.1 mlnDJ30 - -80.04 - 26397.98NASDAQ - -44.50 - 7911.8SP500 - -17.20 - 2921.63Drifting Off Highs - Oct 08 - 14:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have drifted lower off their levels from half an hour ago, though still stand firmly within their daily range.Top decliners in the S&P 500 include NektarTherapeutics (NKTR 16.51, -2.16, -11.57%) -- after analysts at Goldman downgraded the stock to a "Sell" rating while also trimming their price target on the name to $16 from $54, Waters (WAT 209.69, -13.79, -6.17%) -- after med-tech peer Qiagen's (QGEN 25.33, -6.73, -20.99%) revenue warning, executive departure, and BostonScientific (BSX 37.92, -2.43, -6.02%) -- also down in sympathy to QGEN's news.Conversely, airliner American Airlines (AAL 26.64, +0.81, +3.14%) sits atop the index.NASDAQ - 808 - 2220 - 1.20 blnNYSE - 837 - 1934 - 358.0 mlnDJ30 - -154.47 - 26323.55NASDAQ - -74.32 - 7881.98SP500 - -25.87 - 2912.96Gold Erases Gains, Finishes Slightly Lower - Oct 08 - 14:00 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 cracked a session high, the Nasdaq Composite made an afternoon high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average mostly stayed put in the last half hour.

The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows. The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care). Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:30 p.m. ET. An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14. Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program. Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:• The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.• The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.[Correction: a previous version of this comment indicated Fed Chair Powell would speak at 1:50 p.m. ET.

Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%). It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%. Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower.

The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%. There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses. Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market. It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher. In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:• Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday. • Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTD• S&P 500 +17.2% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTD• Russell 2000 +11.1% YTDNASDAQ - 1318 - 1751 - 1.7 blnNYSE - 952 - 1615 - 841.5 mlnDJ30 - -95.70 - 26478.02NASDAQ - -26.18 - 7956.3SP500 - -13.22 - 2938.83Load-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

Visiongain Report: Global CDSS Market is Anticipated to Grow on Account of Rising Number of Chronic Diseases, Technological AdvancementsTargeted News ServiceSeptember 5, 2019 Thursday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 897 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON, England BodyVisiongain, a independent media company, issued the following news:Visiongain has launched a new pharma report Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) Market Report 2019-2029: By Component (Services, Software, Hardware), by Product (Integrated CDSS, Standalone CDSS), by Type (Therapeutic CDSS, Diagnostic CDSS), by Model (Knowledge-Based CDSS Model, Non-Knowledge-Based CDSS Model), by Delivery Model (On-Premise CDSS, Cloud-Based CDSS), by Application (Conventional CDSS, Advanced CDSS), by Level of Interactivity (Active CDSS, Passive CDSS), by Setting (Inpatient Settings, Ambulatory Care Settings).Global CDSS Market is anticipated to grow on account of rising number of chronic diseases, technological advancements in order to reduce medical errors and hospital re-admission rates. The global CDSS market is anticipated to grow at a lucrative CAGR of 10.3% and anticipated to reach USD 3.63 Billion by 2029.Clinical Decision Support (CDS) offers understanding and person-specific data, intelligently filtered or submitted at suitable moments to clinicians, employees, patients or other people to improve health and health care. CDS includes a range of instruments for enhancing clinical workflow decision-making. These instruments include computerized reminders and alerts to patients and care providers, clinical guidelines, patient data reports and summaries, templates for paperwork, diagnostic help, and context-specific reference information, among others.There is extensive concern over the healthcare costs and health risks from inappropriate use of expensive medical imaging. In response, CDSS have been designed to notify health care providers regarding ordered diagnostic scan which is inconsistent with current professional guidelines.In the year 2014, Medicare spent more than USD 4 billion on high-cost diagnostic imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans, out of which around 30% of diagnostic imaging is unnecessary. Medical professionals and payers are worried about the health hazards and health care expenses of using such high-cost scans inappropriately. With health care expenditure accounting for nearly one-fifth of the U.S. economy and an even greater share of the budgets of the government industry, policymakers are interested in lowering health care expenditure that offers patients with minimal value. Reflecting worries about improper scanning, Medicare will no longer be able reimburse suppliers for costly scans starting in January 2020 unless they are ordered using a qualifying CDSS.North America holds majority of market share owing to driving factors such as regulatory mandates, rising medication errors, growing prevalence of chronic diseases, growing healthcare expenditure among others. Asia Pacific region is expected to experience the highest growth in terms of CAGR over the forecast period owing to growing demand from India, Japan and China. Growing government support in these regions is anticipated to offer lucrative opportunities for CDSS manufacturers. For instance, Chinese government has collaborated with Elsevier and Wolters Kluwer to improve the overall quality of care and help physicians in evidence based decision makingCurrently, key players are forming various strategies such as acquisitions, mergers, partnerships, collaborations and launching new products in order to strengthen their position in the global CDSS market. Companies are also expanding their R&#38;D, distribution, and management facilities in order to expand their business and to hold a competitive edge in the market.The comprehensive market report features companies such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Athenahealth, Inc., Autonomy Corporation plc, Carestream Health, Cerner Corporation, EBSCO Industries, Inc., Elsevier, Epic Systems Corp., Evidera/ Archimedes Inc, FirstDataBank, GE Healthcare, GIDEON Informatics, Inc., Hearst health, IBM, Koninklijke Philips N.V., McKesson Corporation, NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, NXGN Management, LLC, Optum, Inc. (UnitedHealth Group), Philips Healthcare (A Subsidiary of Royal Philips Electronics), Siemens Healthcare Private Limited, The National Decision Support Company, Truven Health Analytics, VisualDx, Wolters Kluwer and Zynx Health among other prominent players.Also the research study offers market estimation and forecast for the period ranging 2019-2029 for global markets such as North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and MEA along with regional sub-markets as U.S., Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, UK, France, Italy, Spain, Nordic, Benelux, Russia, Poland, India, Japan, China, Australia, ASEAN, GCC, South Africa and North Africa.* * *About VisiongainVisiongain is one of the fastest growing and most innovative independent media companies in Europe.

Donald Trump, at the UN: "No responsible government should subsidize Iran's bloodlust"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 24, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 589 wordsBody       Us President Donald Trump (REUTERS/Carlo Allegri) (CARLO ALLEGRI/)Donald Trump said at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday that "no responsible government should subsidize Iran's bloodlust, as part of its high-pressure campaign against the Persian regime."As long as Iran's threatening conduct continues, sanctions will not be lifted," the president clarified, and threatened to toughen these measures if Tehran "does not change in his conduct."The General Assembly is being held amid heavy tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, backed by its old ally, the United States. The Saudis accuse Iran of an attack this month on two oil facilities, something Iran rejects. The Trump administration, confronted with the Persian regime, has exchanged growing criticism and threats with Tehran. Washington has been imposing increasingly harsh sanctions for months."The United States is not seeking conflict with any country, but I will never stop defending American interests," Trump said. The representative, who in June cancelled an attack plan against Iran in response to the takedown of a drone, added: "Anyone can go to war, only the bravest choose peace."Regarding the crisis in Venezuela, the Republican leader again condemned the Chavista regime. "Maduro is a puppet of Cubans who hides from his own people," he said. He also noted that in the last year "a historic coalition has been built" of countries that he is unaware of As president Maduro, who decided not to travel to the summit. "To the Venezuelans who endure this nightmare, know that the whole of America is with you," he added.(AFP) (JOHANNES EISELE/)He subsequently attacked left-wing policies. "They do not support equality, the well-being of the country. Socialism and communism are only about power. In the last century, 100 million people have been killed. As we see in Venezuela, the death list is increasing," he said.In his third intervention in that scenario, the representative again made a defense of his motto "America First", describing that the world is divided "between those who believe they can govern the rest and those who seek to govern their countries" . In that sense, he added: "Wise leaders always put the well-being of their country first. The future is not for the globalists, the future belongs to patriots and sovereign countries."Amid fears over a possible US market recession, Trump highlighted his country's economic advances, such as low unemployment, and assured that achievements are due to his administration's actions. He also defended protectionist policies and the revision of trade agreements with other countries. "We want there to be a fair trade balance," he said. Calmly, he lashed out at the Chinese government, which he accused of unfair financial practices and theft of technological information, which is why he defended the fees imposed against the Asian giant. On Hong Kong, he said the world expects China to respect its "binding treaty," "protect the freedom" and "democratic way of life" of former British territory.Trump also made a mention of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, whom he threatened on this very stage with "fury and fire."After two years of face-to-face encounters and personal letters, he demanded that the communist regime fulfill the peninsula's promise of denuclearization.Trump's speech also included an defense of religious freedom, though it made no mention of the climate emergency, one of the week's big issues for the relentless calls of activists for greater accountability from governments.Load-Date: September 25, 2019End of Document

Jack Ma retires from Alibaba as he turns 55. What comes next?CNN WireSeptember 10, 2019 Tuesday 7:22 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 943 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Jack Ma, the billionaire who ushered e-commerce into China, is officially stepping down as Alibaba's executive chairman on Tuesday. He's celebrating his retirement with a big bash at an Olympic-sized stadium in the company's hometown of Hangzhou.After two decades building Alibaba into a $460 billion business, Ma is now pivoting full time to philanthropy. He started the Jack Ma Foundation in 2014, and has cited the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as an inspiration for his charitable endeavors. "Jack has been signaling for some time his interests in philanthropy, environment, women's empowerment, education and development," said Duncan Clark, the author of "Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built."The eager teacher"Before I'm 70 years old, I can do something in other fields, in areas like education," Ma said at an Alibaba event last September. Ma announced his intention to resign a year ago. Even after stepping away from Alibaba's senior management and board, he is expected to continue to shape the company's future through his lifetime membership with the Alibaba Partnership, a group of 36 people that can nominate a majority of the directors to the board. He also retains a 6.22% share of the company. Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang will also take on the role of chairman from Ma. A Communist Party member, Ma is China's most famous entrepreneur and --- with a fortune of nearly $40 billion --- the country's richest man. But he's also a former English teacher, and has often talked about his passion for education. The date that Ma chose to formally step down, September 10, is Teachers' Day in China, "so there's some messaging in that," Clark said. It's also Ma's 55th birthday. Ma referenced his previous career to explain why he was stepping down from his company. "Teachers always want their students to exceed them, so the responsible thing ... for me and the company to do is to let younger, more talented people take over in leadership roles," Ma said last September.Last year, Ma spoke about the challenges for the future of education at the World Economic Forum, warning that "if we do not change the way we teach, 30 years later we will be in trouble."The current knowledge-based approach of teaching will "fail our kids" who will never be able to compete with machines, Ma said. Children should be taught "soft skills" like independent thinking, values and teamwork, he added.In 2017, Ma's foundation pledged $45 million over 10 years to help discover and cultivate future teaching talent in rural China.Ma has also taken his teaching beyond China to other emerging markets, according to Clark. The tech tycoon has been "sharing his perspectives and experience in business in places like Africa," Clark said, where he has established a $10 million entrepreneurial prize. Ma has also funded wildlife protection initiatives and developed good relations with African leaders like Paul Kagame in Rwanda.Supporting women Ma and Alibaba have hosted a biennial conference in China on women and entrepreneurship since 2015. The events have drawn names such as Arianna Huffington and Vera Wang. This year's conference included a video message from Rihanna."Women have always played an integral role in Alibaba since its establishment two decades ago," Ma said at the conference last month, according to a report published by the company's news site Alizila. Ma said that gender equality is one of the most-important issues in the 21st century, noting that "if you want your business to succeed, it is critical to appoint enough female leaders." Nearly half of Alibaba's senior management team are women. Leaving 'on a high'Ma was honored by the Chinese government last November as one of 100 people who had made "outstanding contributions" to China's economic transformation in the past four decades. The event was reported by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, which outed Ma as a member. The revelation came amid rising concern over the tighter grip being exerted on China's private sector by the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping.Ma is stepping away from Alibaba at a relatively young age. He has said in the past that he wants to retire earlier than Bill Gates, who stepped down as chairman of Microsoft at the age of 58 in 2014. Some people have linked the timing of Ma's decision to the Chinese government's increasing restrictions on internet companies. But Ma denied that Beijing was forcing him out when he spoke at the Alibaba event last September. "I got rumors from outside China, saying: 'It's because the government wants to push you down.' Nobody can [push you out], if you don't want to leave, right? Because I know it's nothing about the politics or government," Ma said. Still, some observers say that Ma had flown a bit too close to the sun, and leaving Alibaba is partly about self-preservation. The charitable projects Ma has signaled he is interested in pursuing in retirement have the added benefit of being unlikely to cause waves with China's leadership. The final chapter in Clark's book on Ma was titled "Icon or Icarus." "He's keen to secure his legacy. He's not fully exiting the company. But this move is a smart way to leave on a high," Clark said. "To avoid being Icarus you have to ... not only avoid flying too close to the sun, but also avoid crashing into the waves. So you have to still be ambitious. In philanthropy, education, environment he has plenty of room to soar yet. Areas where the government will be tolerant if not encouraging," Clark said. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

TikTok has been censoring LGBTQ content in some countriesBusiness Insider USSeptember 27, 2019 Friday 05:21 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 739 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: A TikTok spokesman told Business Insider the guidelines banning LGBTQ content in Turkey are no longer in use.BodyZach Gibson / Stringer / Getty Images• TikTok was censoring LGBTQ content in countries it deemed morally conservative, such as Turkey, documents seen by The Guardian show.• This comes on top of more general guidelines revealed by earlier this week which showed TikTok was censoring topics that were political sore spots for the Chinese government.• A TikTok spokesman told Business Insider the guidelines banning LGBTQ content in Turkey are no longer in use.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Short-form video app TikTok has been censoring LGBTQ content in countries it deems conservative, including Turkey, according to a new report from the Guardian.The revelations highlight the extraordinary degree of control TikTok has exerted over the content on its platform - and how the Chinese company has clamped down on social and political content that American social networks like Facebook and Twitter are happy to allow.TikTok has more than one billion monthly users, a company executive said in June 2019. There have been nearly 100 million downloads in the United States, and 250 million in India.The news follows an earlier report from the British newspaper on the Chinese company's internal moderation guidelines, which revealed that political subjects likely to anger the Chinese government such as Tibetan independence and Tiananmen Square were banned on the app.Read more: Internal documents showed TikTok censoring topics that would anger ChinaTikTok's response to The Guardian's first story was that the documents it viewed were outdated, and the company has since adopted more nuanced and "localised" approach to moderation.Bans on 'partially naked buttocks' and 'homosexual lovers'The Guardian reported that the secondary set of documents were local rules, to be added on top of the more baseline general guidelines.One set of guidelines were dubbed "strict," and applied to more conservative countries. These included bans on partial nudity, including "partially naked buttocks" and cleavage where "more than 1/3 of the whole cleavage length" was visible. "Lengthy depictions" of sanitary pads were also banned.Another set of guidelines applied to individual countries, and the Guardian viewed rules which applied to Turkey.Alongside cracking down on politically contentious issues such as Kurdish separatism, as well as non-Islamic religious content ("Jesus," "Maria," and "angels" were among the things banned under this category), a long list of content relating to the LGBTQ community was banned. Among the things censored were:• "Intimate activities (holding hands, touching, kissing) between homosexual lovers."• "Reports of homosexual groups, including news, characters, music, tv show, pictures."• Any content "protecting [the] rights of homosexuals (parade, slogan, etc.)" or the "promotion of homosexuality."It's not clear what country-specific rules TikTok has operated in other countries outside of Turkey, and what other political or social content has been banned around the world.TikTok says the rules are no longer in useIn a statement to Business Insider, a TikTok spokesman said: "TikTok is a platform for creativity, and committed to equality and diversity. Our platform has experienced rapid growth in Turkey and other markets, and as we grow we are constantly learning and refining our approach to moderation."The referenced guidelines regarding LGBTQ content in Turkey are no longer in use, and we have since made significant progress in establishing a more robust localised approach. However we recognise the need to do more and we are actively working with local third parties and independent advisors to ensure our processes are appropriate."The spokesman added that there are now no guidelines regarding LGBTQ content in Turkey.Do you work at TikTok?

Republicans Don't Want to Talk About ItAtlantic OnlineOctober 4, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1519 wordsByline: Uri FriedmanBodyWhen then-candidate Donald Trump urged the Russian government to find Hillary Clinton's missing emails, in 2016, his own running mate Mike Pence turned on him,            warning the Kremlin of "serious consequences" if Russian hackers had interfered in the election. The leader of Trump's party in the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan,            advised the "devious thug" Vladimir Putin to "stay out of this election."When Trump said he would accept damaging information on a political opponent from another country, this past June, Republican lawmakers            reprimanded the president. "If a public official is approached by a foreign government offering anything of value, the answer is no," said Lindsey Graham, one of Trump's top allies in the Senate.But something significant happened yesterday. Standing before reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump urged two foreign governments-including one that his administration and members of his party            have identified as a potential existential threat to the American way of life-to intervene in the 2020 U.S. election by investigating what he alleges was wrongdoing by the man most likely to challenge him for the presidency. In a twist on Richard Nixon's infamous            declaration that "when the president does it, that means it is not illegal," Trump signaled that when the president does it openly and unabashedly, that must mean it is a            perfectly normal use of power rather than an abuse of it.Implicitly, he was daring his fellow Republicans to say otherwise. And thus far they mostly have not, choosing instead to either cheer on the president or stay silent on the matter. Just like that, a democratic norm stretching back to the founding of the republic is collapsing before our eyes.[           Read: Democrats must act now to deter foreign interference in the 2020 election]In his remarks, Trump            called on the Ukrainian government to open a "major"            corruption investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter-saying out loud what he had quietly conveyed to the Ukrainian president in a            phone call now at the center of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats. Then the president went much further still, encouraging the Chinese government, which is embroiled in a trade war with the Trump administration, to launch a probe into the Bidens'            business dealings as well.Beijing is            unlikely to comply with Trump's wishes, but that doesn't make the president's move any less striking. With regard to China, Trump wasn't just exploiting his foreign-policy making powers to target Biden and possibly            violating the law by asking for something of value to his campaign from a foreign national, as appears to be the case with Ukraine. He was also turning for help in his reelection bid to an authoritarian adversary. In both instances, Trump was attempting to assign investigations into his domestic rival not to his own law-enforcement agencies but to those of Ukraine and China, ranked 77th and 82nd out of 126 countries, respectively, in a            recent global survey of the rule of law.[           Read: Imagine if Obama had done this]What's more, Trump has            cast the solicitation of political assistance from whichever foreign power is forthcoming as a routine "duty" and "absolute right" of his office. "As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time," he            wrote on Twitter today. Trump's concern about corruption, however, happens to focus solely on a case affecting his personal political interests and one he            claims to have already cracked despite a lack of evidence.In the face of all this, Republicans have largely joined ranks with the president or held their fire. Asked whether Trump's China comments were appropriate, Pence            deferred this time around to his boss, noting that the American people have a "right to know" whether Biden or his family "profited from his position," and that Trump clearly believes "other nations around the world should look into it as well." Kevin McCarthy, the new Republican leader in the House, has yet to say anything about the president's overture to China,            instead           pressing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to suspend her impeachment inquiry, because of flaws in the process. Graham, who            says he has "zero problems" with Trump's call with Ukraine's president, has gently pushed back against the president's latest salvo in his campaign against Biden while defending it as an understandable response to persecution. "I don't want to go down that road," Graham            told The Washington Post regarding a Chinese probe of the Biden family, but Trump "feels like everyone is coming after him all the time and he hasn't done anything wrong."[           Read: Why Republicans aren't turning on Trump]Some have even taken this moment to recognize Trump's trademark boldness. "It's classic Donald Trump," The Wall Street Journal's editor at large, Gerard Baker,            crowed on Fox News yesterday regarding the president's China gambit. "He doubles down." Republican Senator Ron Johnson, who            noted that he doesn't "trust" China and would rather the Bidens be investigated domestically, nevertheless downplayed the president's call with his Ukrainian counterpart as "Trump being Trump."Congressional Republicans such as Cory Gardner, Lisa Murkowski, and Thom Tillis, who            all expressed disgust several months ago about Trump's openness to accepting compromising material about an opponent from foreign sources, have as of this writing            not directly addressed the propriety of Trump's call for China and Ukraine to scrutinize the Democratic front-runner in the race for the White House. (The Atlantic reached out to two dozen Republicans who sit on relevant foreign-affairs committees in the House and Senate regarding their reaction to Trump's message yesterday and its national-security consequences. All either declined to comment or did not respond to the queries.)Some Republicans have criticized Trump's appeals to Ukraine and China, but for now they are the exceptions. The senator from Utah and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney said in a statement that the president's actions were "wrong and appalling," and that "when the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated."           * The senator from Nebraska Ben Sasse            told the Omaha World-Herald that "Americans don't look to Chinese commies for the truth. If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that's a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps." Will Hurd, a congressman from Texas who is not seeking reelection,            told CNN that "a president of the United States shouldn't be doing" what Trump did, adding that "we're in a tight and complex trade negotiation with China now, and so you're potentially giving them something to hold over your head."But for the most part, Trump's no-holds-barred approach to politics now seems to hold sway within the Grand Old Party. Short-term calculations have eclipsed long-term considerations, such as how Republicans would feel if a Democratic president mimicked Trump's actions to take down a GOP rival. What divides Americans (partisan politics) has overwhelmed what unites them (a commitment to democracy that, say, China doesn't share).At its most fundamental, what Trump questioned yesterday was who gets to have a say in how the American people choose their political leaders. He did so in a manner that would have            alarmed the Founding Fathers and is largely without precedent in modern American history. (Perhaps the            closest analogue is the Nixon campaign's outreach to the South Vietnamese government to thwart efforts at ending the Vietnam War and boost his chances in the 1968 election. But even in that case Nixon was            not directly involved in the scheme to the extent Trump has been in his.)Over the past two weeks, the question at the heart of the Ukraine scandal has morphed from whether Trump pressured a foreign government to investigate and implicate his likely challenger for the presidency to whether doing so is right or wrong. The president, facing off against an opposing team, sought to recruit a third team watching from the sidelines to his side. When the whistle blew in response to the blatant infraction, Trump's defiant response was to try to enlist yet another team and to declare that these are simply the new rules of the game. So far, most of his teammates have discarded the old rules and rallied behind their captain.Christian Paz contributed reporting.           *This article originally misstated Mitt Romney as the Senator from Massachusetts, not Utah.Load-Date: October 5, 2019End of Document

Stock Market UpdateBriefing.comOctober 16, 2019 4:20 PMCopyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 5180 wordsBody-- Stock market closes little changed amid lack of conviction among buyers and sellers-- Retail sales unexpectedly declined in September; concerns about the completion of the first phase of U.S.-China trade deal-- Earnings reports came in mostly better than expectedWall Street closes little changed; earnings remained positive, retail sales declined - Oct 16 - 16:15 ET[BRIEFING.COM] Wall Street finished little changed on Wednesday, as investors weighed negative macro news against another set of mostly positive earnings results. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.  The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines. The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%). The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front. On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate  has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S. In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield  and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:• Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.• Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.• The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.• The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.• Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTD• S&P 500 +19.3% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTD• Russell 2000 +13.1% YTDNASDAQ - 1594 - 1467 - 1.9 blnNYSE - 1496 - 1370 - 753.0 mlnDJ30 - -22.82 - 27001.98NASDAQ - -24.52 - 8124.19SP500 - -5.99 - 2989.69WTI crude rebounds 1%, energy stocks still down - Oct 16 - 15:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has traded mostly in negative territory today and is on track to close slightly lower. The benchmark index is currently down 0.2%. One last look inside the S&P 500 shows five sectors trading up and six sectors trading down, with most trading within 0.3% of their flat lines.

This might be since retails sales were revised upwards to +0.6% from +0.4% in August, suggesting that the data from September might have been a natural pullback. Notable companies that will report earnings after today's close include IBM (IBM 142.28, -0.72, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 286.81, +2.60, +0.9%), and CSX (CSX 68.92, -0.26, -0.4%). Morgan Stanley (MS 42.89, +0.36, +0.8%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 50.36, -0.3, -0.1%), and Union Pacific (UNP 163.34, +0.20, +0.1%) are slated for tomorrow morning. NASDAQ - 1582 - 1448 - 1.3 blnNYSE - 1478 - 1402 - 367.8 mlnDJ30 - +13.13 - 27037.93NASDAQ - -21.66 - 8127.05SP500 - -3.27 - 2992.41Stocks Hold Declines Following Beige Book - Oct 16 - 14:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] On the whole, treasury yields and the major averages held their losses following the Beige Book release. In sum, the Fed's Beige Book for October stated that the U.S. economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report, down from comments of modest growth in the September 4th report. Below are some additional highlights from the Fed's comments.Also, contacts in some Districts suggested that persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity. The early impact of a recent auto strike was limited. Freight shipments stabilized after falling during the previous reporting period.What's more, economic expansion is mostly expected to continue, however, many businesses lowered their outlooks for growth in the coming 6 to 12 months.On balance, employment rose slightly amid reports of persistent worker shortages though a number of Districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft.NASDAQ - 1520 - 1499 - 1.23 blnNYSE - 1371 - 1478 - 342.0 mlnDJ30 - -7.95 - 27016.85NASDAQ - -30.45 - 8118.26SP500 - -6.68 - 2989Gold Higher Ahead Of Beige Book - Oct 16 - 13:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The markets stand little changed in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still at the bottom, down 0.42%.Gold futures settled $10 higher (+0.7%) to $1,493.50/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index -0.3% 98.02.As a reminder, at the top of the hour the market will receive the Fed's Beige Book for October.NASDAQ - 1487 - 1533 - 1.14 blnNYSE - 1374 - 1458 - 318.0 mlnDJ30 - -18.23 - 27006.57NASDAQ - -33.92 - 8114.79SP500 - -7.66 - 2988.02Drifting Lower - Oct 16 - 13:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have pushed to afternoon lows in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, too, pushing lower though to a lesser extent.Taking a brief look at the most active stocks today, the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.42, -1.00, -1.44%), UnitedHealth (UNH 235.35, -3.24, -1.36%), and Microsoft (MSFT 139.90, -1.67, -1.18%).Conversely, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 135.63, +2.79, +2.10%) sits at the top of the index.The DJIA now stands +0.28% on the month.NASDAQ - 1501 - 1497 - 1.06 blnNYSE - 1393 - 1445 - 294.0 mlnDJ30 - -33.20 - 26991.6NASDAQ - -38.20 - 8110.51SP500 - -9.59 - 2986.09Stocks trade mixed; investors weigh macro, earnings news - Oct 16 - 12:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher. Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms. The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts. Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson  (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:• Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.• Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.• The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.• The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.NASDAQ - 1587 - 1400 - 963.1 mlnNYSE - 1498 - 1330 - 269.5 mlnDJ30 - -15.87 - 27008.93NASDAQ - -32.81 - 8115.9SP500 - -7.29 - 2988.39Netflix trades lower in front of earnings report - Oct 16 - 12:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session.

Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China. In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.   NASDAQ - 1567 - 1345 - 670.6 mlnNYSE - 1624 - 1154 - 193.6 mlnDJ30 - -10.30 - 27014.5NASDAQ - -18.49 - 8130.22SP500 - -2.22 - 2993.46Earnings results remain mostly positive - Oct 16 - 10:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday.

JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though. Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC.

Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally. Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results. As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out. Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors.

Crofts: The NBA Bows to the Almighty DollarThe Daily Utah Chronicle: University of UtahOctober 17, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 689 wordsBodyOver the past week, there has been growing controversy in the NBA after a tweet from Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey. Morey tweeted an image in support of the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The image said "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong." You may be asking yourself how this tweet is even a controversy, but many Chinese Twitter users began calling for Morey to be fired. This pressure prompted the Houston Rockets owner, Tilman Fertitta, to tweet that Morey "does NOT speak for the Rockets" in hopes of appeasing China.Listen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi- Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019In response, Chinese sponsors, partners, streaming services and even the Chinese basketball league have threatened to cut ties with the Rockets and the NBA. It is interesting that since China severed ties, the NBA has gone on a full apology tour to China in attempts to save the relationship damaged by the pro-democracy tweet.Anyone who believes in freedom and human rights should let the image speak for them, and Fertitta should be ashamed of himself for saying that Morey doesn't speak for the Rockets simply due to his public pro-democracy stance. The image tweeted was in fact not threatening, and it is not something that any American should feel the need to apologize for. The quote, "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong" is far from a controversial statement - but in the world today, anything that irritates the Chinese dictatorship and threatens access to the Chinese market must be immediately retracted.This controversy really is a symbol of a much larger and continuously growing issue in America. The more China has grown, the more American companies have pandered and bowed down to its oppressive dictatorship and values. To these companies, a dollar means more than American values, democracy or even basic human rights.The sad truth is that the same companies that virtue signal and speak out against policies and statements they don't approve of in American society are the same companies that ship jobs overseas to China and other countries where workers do not have many protective rights, labor in unsanitary conditions and are not paid a living wage.Nike, for instance, stopped the release of a shoe because Twitter was offended by the use of the Betsy Ross Flag and in their advertisement with Colin Kaepernick, the athlete said "Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything." Yes, this is the same Nike who makes shoes in Vietnam, where workers are forced to work in sweatshop conditions and only paid low hourly wages. It is the same Nike who loves doing business in China, despite the horrible abuses of human rights by the Chinese government. Maybe someone should ask why Nike doesn't believe in sacrificing profits in the name of justice and human rights?These "American" companies will chase a dollar wherever it goes. They will take money from a rival even if it's not in the best interest of human rights or the values of the United States. If China offers a big market and a crisp dollar bill in exchange for silence, these companies see groveling to a communist government as one hell of a deal. China is our top rival and enemy, and stands on the verge of overtaking the United States as the biggest economy in the world. There is no denying their attempt to overtake us as the main global superpower.These companies have no morals, no values and no care for America. The only real concern these companies have is the almighty dollar. It should be offensive to every U.S. citizen that these large corporations have betrayed the American worker, turned their back on American values and helped legitimize oppressive regimes. In the famous words of Dr. Martin Luther King, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." So, if the NBA won't say it and pandering corporations won't say it, I will - "Fight for freedom, Stand with Hong Kong."[email protected]@TheChronyLoad-Date: October 17, 2019End of Document

TAIWANESE MAN GETS SUSPENDED JAIL TERM OVER RADIO BROADCASTS INTO CHINAStates News ServiceSeptember 26, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 463 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A Taiwanese businessman was convicted in a Thai court Thursday of illegally hosting a radio station that broadcast uncensored news to listeners in China and sentenced to eight months in jail, suspended for two years, his lawyer said.Chiang Yung-hsin and his lawyer appeared at Chiang Mai provincial court, 720 kilometers (450 miles) north of Bangkok, Thursday morning to hear the verdict on the charges of "possession and use of an unlicensed transmitter" and "setting up an unlicensed radio station.""The court sentenced him to 8 months in jail but suspended the penalty for two years and fined him 60,000 baht ($2,000)," Chiang's lawyer, Tawat Wipanguean told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service."In other words, the court believes he knew about the station. Luckily he was not jailed.""Now he becomes a convict but he stays out of jail due to the suspension and becomes persona non-grata," he added.Chiang, 52, was indicted in January on charges of setting up the station without a permit for Sound of Hope (SOH), a San Francisco-based radio network that was founded by Falun Gong, a religious movement banned in China, according to court documents.Chiang consistently denied the charges in a case that played out amid claims that Beijing pressured Thai authorities to shut down the station.Tawat told BenarNews that Chiang "will go back to Taiwan and discuss with his family what to do next.""He has not seen his wife for over a year now. We have a month to appeal but if he doesn't come back again, we won't appeal the case,"A court official confirmed the verdict was read Thursday morning but the court declined to reveal the verdict to the public. An assistant of Chiang said he was not comfortable commenting on the case at the moment.Thailand strictly controls radio and TV stations as well as prohibiting broadcasts in foreign languages, except for pre-approved items, to neighboring countries, according to broadcast experts.Founded in 1992 in China's northeast, the Falun Gong spiritual movement gained increasing influence as the fastest growing religion in the PRC and overseas over the next seven years. In 1999 the Chinese government at the orders of then President Jiang Zemin began a harsh and sometimes deadly crackdown on the sect, dragging practitioners from their homes and sending them to detention centers.Outside of China, the movement was considered harmless and continued to flourish. It is often cited as an example of religious persecution in China, with practitioners and allied religious freedom advocates holding protests in major cities to bring attention to the situation faced by Falun Gong believers in the PRC.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: September 27, 2019End of Document

As part of the treaty, China agreed to make some agricultural concessions while the United States would ease some tariff pressure.Read: Is the end of the trade war coming? Trump announces pre-agreement with China"In our view, we believe that markets have been positively derived from a perception of the decrease in risks associated with the trade war, leading to the positioning of investors in higher-risk assets such as stocks," analysts from Masari Casa de Bolsa said.According to Gabriela Siller, Director of Financial Economic Analysis at Base Bank, the stock market is also helped by the expectation of a Brexit by agreement, following the meeting between Boris Johnson and the Prime Minister of Ireland , after which the possibility of "a path to reach an agreement" was mentioned.Also read: Boris Johnson's 'Brexit' plan is a trap, at least that's what Brussels believesIn Mexico, the market fell out of good news and the main index of the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV), the IPC, amassed a drop from 0.5% to 43,214. Points. The FTSE BIVA of the Institutional Securities Exchange (BIVA) fell 0.4% to 889.87 units.The week found that the World Bank adjusted its growth estimates for the economy to 0.6% for this year, a performance less than the previous 1.7% expected.For the next few days, the market will remain on the lookout for trade progress between the United States and China, the Brexit process, the publication of China's third-quarter GDP, and in Mexico at the beginning of quarterly corporate reports.Load-Date: October 12, 2019End of Document

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -26.10.The S&P 500 futures trade eight points, or 0.3%, below fair value after a volatile week of trading last week left the benchmark index little changed. Futures have wavered in negative territory all session but are currently trading near their highs while investors digest a batch of weekend news.On the trade front, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal and is not committed on reforming Chinese industrial policy or government subsidies. President Trump's call for China to investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could also complicate talks, according to The New York Times.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be representing China while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and USTR Robert Lighthizer will be representing the US. It is not clear if White House Director of Trade policy Peter Navarro will be involved in the negotiations, but the markets will likely perceive it as a negative if his name is included due to his hawkish stance. White House Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview said that "deputy" level talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday to lay the groundwork for higher level talks on Thursday and Friday. Mr. Kudlow said that some "good news" is possible following these trade talks but he hedged that by saying he could be "dead wrong" about that. The US is scheduled to increase the rate on $250 bln in tariffs to 30% from 25% on October 15. This tranche covers mostly industrial and technology goods. In addition, the US is scheduled to initiate the final tranche of $160 bln in 15% tariffs (that will cover laptops, cell phones, and clothing items) on December 15.Over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that China is more reluctant to agree to broad trade deal with US and will not offer US reforms to Chinese industrial policy or to government subsidies. NY Times reported Friday night that expectations for US and China trade talks have been increasing which could foreshadow an initial deal where US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for protections on intellectual property and increased agricultural purchases. The article also noted that President Trump's call that China investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden could complicate the trade talks.There are three different scenarios that could come from the China trade talks.Scenario 1 (Market Positive): US agrees to hold off on the October 15 rate increase and possibly the final $160 bln tariff tranche in exchange for increased purchases of agriculture products.Scenario 2 (Market Negative): The two sides agree to keep talking in the future, but the US moves forward with the planned tariff rate increase. Scenario 3 (Market Positive): The two sides agree to a "mini" trade deal where the US rolls back some tariffs in exchange for some protections on intellectual property. However, any changes to intellectual property will require changes in Chinese law and the Chinese have so far resisted this approach. Furthermore, Mr. Trump has consistently said he wants a "complete deal" with China.Scenario #1 will be a modest positive for the markets and scenario #3 will be a larger positive. The sectors that are likely to see the biggest benefit are retail, industrial, and semiconductors. Scenario #2 will likely be a negative for the markets and especially those sectors. There is some speculation that President Trump and Chinese President Xi could meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic conference November 16-17.Related industrial/technology stocks: BA, GE, CAT, DE, UTX, ISRG, IRBT, CGNX, HON, HOG, AAPL, FIT, NVDA, AMAT, ADI, MXIM, SWKS, HPQ, CRUS.Related retail stocks: XRT, M, JWN, BBY, WMT, TGT, KSS, M.Related agriculture stocks: DE, BG, ANDE, ADM, MOS.07:32SMPL Simply Good Foods raises FY19 adjusted EBITDA guidance (27.26 )Co announced that it anticipates net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended August 31, 2019, to be slightly greater than the outlook the Company provided in its fiscal third quarter earnings release.

(CARS) announced the completion of an amendment to its existing credit facility, which resets the total net leverage covenant during the remaining term of the credit agreement while preserving the favorable pricing structure from the original agreement.

To date, the first seven patients treated (all six treated patients in Cohort 1 and the first patient treated in Cohort 2) have achieved ventilator independence. All treated patients continue to show gains in neuromuscular function, with the first seven patients treated achieving the ability to rise to a standing position, or walk. Safety - AT132 has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a manageable safety profile across both dose groups. Since the last data update in May 2019, there has been one new serious adverse event (SAE) in Cohort 2, an episode of joint swelling that resolved without treatment. Results to date indicate no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and tolerability profile of AT132 between the 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg dose cohorts. Next steps in the AT132 development program include the completion of enrollment and follow-up of patients in the ASPIRO pivotal expansion cohort, designed to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg, and preparations for filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132 in the United States planned in mid-2020 and filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe planned for the second half of 2020.06:04BHGE Baker Hughes announces that the rig count for September 2019 was 1,131, down 7 from the 1,138 counted in August 2019, and up 127 from the 1,004 counted in September 2018 (22.47 )Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 7, 2019End of Document

In Study 202 (Rx nave patients), greater mean log10 declines in HBV DNA (5.27 vs 3.99; p=0.017) and RNA (2.34 vs 0.61; p<0.001) were achieved with 731+Nrtl (entecavir) versus entecavir alone. In Study 201 (Nrtl-suppressed patients), the proportion of patients on 731+Nrtl versus Nrtl alone achieving DNA target not detected (TND) was 69% vs 0% (p<0.001), and the proportion of patients achieving RNA <35 U/mL whose RNA was =35 U/mL at baseline was 52% vs 0% (p=0.0013) respectively. In Study 211, there are 64 HBeAg+ patients currently on extended treatment beyond 24 weeks. Among the 27 HBeAg+ patients receiving 731+Nrtl in Study 201, 41% (11/27) have now achieved DNA TND along with RNA <35 U/mL and HBeAg <1 IU/mL. At their last timepoint, Study 202 patients now in Study 211 (n=22) have demonstrated mean DNA and RNA declines of 6.1 and 3.0 logs, respectively, with observed mean log changes of =0.6 for HBeAg (11 patients =0.5, 4 patients =1.0), >0.8 log for HBcrAg (7 patients =1.0, 3 patients =2.0) and =0.4 log for HBsAg (7 patients =0.5, 3 patients =1.0). 731 continues to exhibit a favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients treated for up to 1 year, with only mild/moderate adverse events and lab abnormalities, and only a single discontinuation due to a Grade 1 rash. The combination of 731+NrtI results in faster and deeper declines in HBV DNA and RNA than NrtI alone, as well as subsequent declines in the surrogate markers of cccDNA (pgRNA, HBeAg and HBcrAg) predictive of cccDNA pool depletion, and HBsAg. The emergent data supports the continued development of 731. ABI-H2158 -- The Second-Generation Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Core Inhibitor (CI) ABI-H2158 is Associated with Potent Antiviral Activity in a 14-Day Monotherapy Study in HBeAg-positive Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)Abstract Summary: The Phase 1b study is enrolling sequential cohorts of 9 patients and each cohort will be randomized to receive 2158 or placebo (7:2) QD for 14 days in a blinded manner. Dosing in the 1st cohort (100 mg) has been completed. In patients receiving 2158, mean declines from Baseline to Day 15 in HBV DNA and RNA levels were 2.3 log10 IU/mL [range 1.7 -- 3.0] and 2.1 log10 IU/mL [range 1.5 - 2.7] respectively. No serious AEs, dose limiting toxicities or premature discontinuations were reported. Three patients reported a total of 5 mild, drug-related AEs that recovered without intervention; dizziness, fatigue, rash, headache and upper abdominal pain. Treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities were infrequent, mild and transient, with no ALT elevations Grade =1 in severity. Day 14 plasma 2158 Cmax and AUC0-24hr were 3,390 ng/mL and 46,100 hr*ng/mL, respectively. Results from the initial 100 mg low dose of ABI-H2158 cohort demonstrated potent antiviral activity, a favourable safety profile when administered for 14 days, and support once daily dosing in CHB patients.07:43PAG Penske Auto increases quarterly dividend to $0.41/share from $0.40/share (45.08 )07:38ABT Abbott Labs reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q4 EPS in-line (81.98 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.84 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.84; revenues rose 5.5% year/year to $8.08 bln vs the $8.1 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus, and 7.6 percent on an organic basis including 3.8% in nutrition, 6.6% in diagnostics, 7.9% in established pharma and 10.6% in medical devices.

This change in top line performance, coupled with lower factory absorption, higher operating expenses arising largely from acquisitions, and other factors, will adversely affect net income for the period. Thus, management expects that quarterly earnings per share are likely to be less than half of the [$0.23] consensus estimate and will provide conclusive data on that subject in its next earnings release."Focusing on full year 2019 results, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 6% year-over-year with mixed performance among our major markets. International sales should increase by about 27% for the full year. However, our domestic sales will likely decrease by about 5% on a per annum basis, which we believe is consistent with industry-wide forecasts showing domestic markets receding by 6% to 12%. With these considerations in mind, we are revising our full year 2019 net sales forecast downward to ~$480 million [from $500 mln vs. $499 mln consensus]. Other previously forecasted financial metrics relating to 2019 remain unchanged since our last earnings call."16:29LW Lamb Weston forms joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina (75.50 -0.34)Lamb Weston has formed a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina to serve the nearly 2-billion-pound South American market.

The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher.

In Study 202 (Rx nave patients), greater mean log10 declines in HBV DNA (5.27 vs 3.99; p=0.017) and RNA (2.34 vs 0.61; p<0.001) were achieved with 731+Nrtl (entecavir) versus entecavir alone. In Study 201 (Nrtl-suppressed patients), the proportion of patients on 731+Nrtl versus Nrtl alone achieving DNA target not detected (TND) was 69% vs 0% (p<0.001), and the proportion of patients achieving RNA <35 U/mL whose RNA was =35 U/mL at baseline was 52% vs 0% (p=0.0013) respectively. In Study 211, there are 64 HBeAg+ patients currently on extended treatment beyond 24 weeks. Among the 27 HBeAg+ patients receiving 731+Nrtl in Study 201, 41% (11/27) have now achieved DNA TND along with RNA <35 U/mL and HBeAg <1 IU/mL. At their last timepoint, Study 202 patients now in Study 211 (n=22) have demonstrated mean DNA and RNA declines of 6.1 and 3.0 logs, respectively, with observed mean log changes of =0.6 for HBeAg (11 patients =0.5, 4 patients =1.0), >0.8 log for HBcrAg (7 patients =1.0, 3 patients =2.0) and =0.4 log for HBsAg (7 patients =0.5, 3 patients =1.0). 731 continues to exhibit a favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients treated for up to 1 year, with only mild/moderate adverse events and lab abnormalities, and only a single discontinuation due to a Grade 1 rash. The combination of 731+NrtI results in faster and deeper declines in HBV DNA and RNA than NrtI alone, as well as subsequent declines in the surrogate markers of cccDNA (pgRNA, HBeAg and HBcrAg) predictive of cccDNA pool depletion, and HBsAg. The emergent data supports the continued development of 731. ABI-H2158 -- The Second-Generation Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Core Inhibitor (CI) ABI-H2158 is Associated with Potent Antiviral Activity in a 14-Day Monotherapy Study in HBeAg-positive Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)Abstract Summary: The Phase 1b study is enrolling sequential cohorts of 9 patients and each cohort will be randomized to receive 2158 or placebo (7:2) QD for 14 days in a blinded manner. Dosing in the 1st cohort (100 mg) has been completed. In patients receiving 2158, mean declines from Baseline to Day 15 in HBV DNA and RNA levels were 2.3 log10 IU/mL [range 1.7 -- 3.0] and 2.1 log10 IU/mL [range 1.5 - 2.7] respectively. No serious AEs, dose limiting toxicities or premature discontinuations were reported. Three patients reported a total of 5 mild, drug-related AEs that recovered without intervention; dizziness, fatigue, rash, headache and upper abdominal pain. Treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities were infrequent, mild and transient, with no ALT elevations Grade =1 in severity. Day 14 plasma 2158 Cmax and AUC0-24hr were 3,390 ng/mL and 46,100 hr*ng/mL, respectively. Results from the initial 100 mg low dose of ABI-H2158 cohort demonstrated potent antiviral activity, a favourable safety profile when administered for 14 days, and support once daily dosing in CHB patients.07:43PAG Penske Auto increases quarterly dividend to $0.41/share from $0.40/share (45.08 )07:38ABT Abbott Labs reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q4 EPS in-line (81.98 )Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.84 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.84; revenues rose 5.5% year/year to $8.08 bln vs the $8.1 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus, and 7.6 percent on an organic basis including 3.8% in nutrition, 6.6% in diagnostics, 7.9% in established pharma and 10.6% in medical devices.

This change in top line performance, coupled with lower factory absorption, higher operating expenses arising largely from acquisitions, and other factors, will adversely affect net income for the period. Thus, management expects that quarterly earnings per share are likely to be less than half of the [$0.23] consensus estimate and will provide conclusive data on that subject in its next earnings release."Focusing on full year 2019 results, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 6% year-over-year with mixed performance among our major markets. International sales should increase by about 27% for the full year. However, our domestic sales will likely decrease by about 5% on a per annum basis, which we believe is consistent with industry-wide forecasts showing domestic markets receding by 6% to 12%. With these considerations in mind, we are revising our full year 2019 net sales forecast downward to ~$480 million [from $500 mln vs. $499 mln consensus]. Other previously forecasted financial metrics relating to 2019 remain unchanged since our last earnings call."16:29LW Lamb Weston forms joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina (75.50 -0.34)Lamb Weston has formed a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina to serve the nearly 2-billion-pound South American market.

The latest development was a report that the US will blacklist 28 Chinese companies, which caused China to declare a retaliation. S&P Futures are trading around the 2930 area.

Chinese markets traded higher all day, but in a relatively narrow range, before closing up 0.3%.

The 100% owned Amaruq satellite deposit is located approx. 50 km northwest of the Meadowbank mine, which in turn is located approx. 110 km by road north of Baker Lake in the Kivalliq District of Nunavut, Canada. Development of the Amaruq project was approved in February 2017 by the company's Board of Directors as a satellite deposit to supply ore to the existing Meadowbank mill.Amaruq ore processing commenced in August 2019 using low-grade stockpiles. In the third quarter of 2019, production at the Meadowbank Complex totaled 48,869 ounces of gold, which included 13,588 ounces from Meadowbank and pre-commercial payable gold production at Amaruq of 35,281 ounces, compared to pre-commercial production guidance of 40,000 gold ounces. During the third quarter, mining activities at Amaruq continued to be affected by slower than expected dewatering activities. Given the slower than expected ramp up of mining activities, the company took the opportunity to accelerate planned maintenance to the milling and crushing circuits, which was originally scheduled for 2020. As a result, the mill was temporarily shut down in mid-September and is expected to restart on or about October 14.As a result, production guidance at the Meadowbank Complex for 2019 is now anticipated to be 200,000 ounces of gold (previous forecast of 230,000 ounces). Despite the lower forecast for the Meadowbank Complex, the company's FY19 production guidance of 1.75 mln ounces of gold remains unchanged.17:03ATR AptarGroup to acquire 49% equity interest in BTY, a Chinese color cosmetics packaging manufacturer (116.56 -0.77)AptarGroup has signed an agreement to acquire a 49% equity interest in three related BTY companies: Suzhou Hsing Kwang, Suqian Hsing Kwang, and Suzhou BTY, collectively referred to as BTY.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain.

Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD16:20QGEN Qiagen also announces CEO transition; CEO Peer M.

If the Parties fail to arrive at any agreement or settlement within the 30-days, and if Aleafia initiates a formal claim for damages, the Company intends to vigorously defend itself.

The latest development was a report that the US will blacklist 28 Chinese companies, which caused China to declare a retaliation. S&P Futures are trading around the 2930 area. After putting in a low of 2927.75, the market has once again signaled this area as a key support zone. The market capped out at 2950.00, which is a key resistance area.In Asia, both China and Hong Kong returned to action. Chinese markets traded higher all day, but in a relatively narrow range, before closing up 0.3%. The Shanghai held a bid following a weaker than expected Caixin Services PMI, coming in at 51.3, compared to consensus of 52.1. The disappointing print led to speculation of stimulus. The Nikkei finished the day 1% stronger following a drop in the yen against the dollar. The currency's weakness led to a strength in export stocks, with Tech names leading the way following better than expected results from Samsung.In Europe, the major bourses are mostly lower. These markets opened higher but the positive sentiment waned. Germany posted better than expected Industrial Production for August, rising 0.3%, beating expectations for a fall of 0.2%. There are also reports that Brexit talks are breaking down, which has weakened the British Pound.

The 100% owned Amaruq satellite deposit is located approx. 50 km northwest of the Meadowbank mine, which in turn is located approx. 110 km by road north of Baker Lake in the Kivalliq District of Nunavut, Canada. Development of the Amaruq project was approved in February 2017 by the company's Board of Directors as a satellite deposit to supply ore to the existing Meadowbank mill.Amaruq ore processing commenced in August 2019 using low-grade stockpiles. In the third quarter of 2019, production at the Meadowbank Complex totaled 48,869 ounces of gold, which included 13,588 ounces from Meadowbank and pre-commercial payable gold production at Amaruq of 35,281 ounces, compared to pre-commercial production guidance of 40,000 gold ounces. During the third quarter, mining activities at Amaruq continued to be affected by slower than expected dewatering activities. Given the slower than expected ramp up of mining activities, the company took the opportunity to accelerate planned maintenance to the milling and crushing circuits, which was originally scheduled for 2020. As a result, the mill was temporarily shut down in mid-September and is expected to restart on or about October 14.As a result, production guidance at the Meadowbank Complex for 2019 is now anticipated to be 200,000 ounces of gold (previous forecast of 230,000 ounces). Despite the lower forecast for the Meadowbank Complex, the company's FY19 production guidance of 1.75 mln ounces of gold remains unchanged.17:03ATR AptarGroup to acquire 49% equity interest in BTY, a Chinese color cosmetics packaging manufacturer (116.56 -0.77)AptarGroup has signed an agreement to acquire a 49% equity interest in three related BTY companies: Suzhou Hsing Kwang, Suqian Hsing Kwang, and Suzhou BTY, collectively referred to as BTY.

Co expects production to be at the mid-point of its original guidance of 28,000-31,000 boe/day and expects capital spending to be at mid-point of $195-$225 mln.Preliminary total company production for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019 averaged 29,600 boe/d with the month of September averaging 31,700 boe/d, compared to June's average of 27,400. The month of September production is nearly 88% oil, an increase from 86% in 2Q19.This improvement is primarily attributed to BRY'ss capital deployment to grow its California production. Preliminary California production, consisting of 100% Brent-based oil, for the quarter is approximately 22,900 bbl/d, an increase of 10.4% compared with last quarter and 17.7% with 3Q18.16:35HA Hawaiian Holdings reports Sept traffic (revenue passenger miles) +3% yr/yr on an increase of 0.7% in capacity (available seat miles); raises Q3 estimates for operating revenue per ASM (25.21 -0.49)Q3 update: Total traffic increased 2.7 percent on a decrease of 0.4 percent in capacity. Load factor increased 2.7 points to 87.8 percent. Company also raised its estimates for operating revenue per ASM due to better than expected yields in long-haul markets, particularly in its International entity to down 0.5% - up 0.5% from down 1.5-4.5%; narrowed its estimates for operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and non-recurring items; narrowed its estimates for gallons of jet fuel consumed; and lowered its estimates for economic fuel cost per gallon.16:34ACGL Arch Capital estimates $65-75 mln of catastrophe losses related to third quarter events (41.63 -0.23)Arch Capital expects to report third quarter 2019 pre-tax catastrophe losses of approx. $65-75 mln, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums. These losses are primarily from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. At this time, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the scope of damage for these events, as well as the other global events. The company's estimate for these events is based on currently available information; actual losses from these events may vary materially from the estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations. The loss estimates exclude the operations of Watford Holdings. Pursuant to GAAP, the company consolidates the results of Watford in its financial statements, although it only owns approx. 11% of Watford's outstanding common equity.16:22WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 declined 0.5% on Monday in a session replete with trade speculation and indecision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD16:20QGEN Qiagen also announces CEO transition; CEO Peer M.

By normalizing foreign election interference, Trump makes a mockery of 'America First'CNN.comOctober 6, 2019 Sunday 1:56 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONSLength: 2097 wordsByline: Opinion by Larry NobleBodyPresident Donald Trump has exceeded expectations when it comes to ignoring the norms and laws of acting "presidential." He tells and repeats obvious lies, uses his office to promote his businesses, attacks the press for reporting the truth and rejects congressional oversight and attempts to obstruct lawful investigations.Some of these actions are gross violations of past norms and democratic values, while others potentially violate the law. Still, much of the damage he is doing can be repaired.What may be more dangerous is that Trump is trying to normalize the act of soliciting or accepting foreign election interference, even from our adversaries. What started as Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort secretly attending a June 2016 meeting with Russian agents in hopes of receiving what the Russians claimed was damaging information about Hillary Clinton has now escalated to President Trump publicly urging Ukraine and China to investigate a Democratic candidate he may run against in 2020.If foreign actors successfully influence our elections at the behest of our own President, the damage to our democratic infrastructure and national sovereignty may be irreparable.America first?Just one day after ex-special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about his investigation into Russian interference In the 2016 election, President Trump talked to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the phone.According to the White House's rough transcript of the July 25 call, Trump asked Zelensky "to do us a favor" and "get to the bottom" of a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine hacked the DNC email server during the 2016 elections and then framed Russia. Later in that same phone call, Trump urged Zelensky to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who in December of 2015 called for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had investigated a gas company with which his son Hunter Biden had a role on the board. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.Seeking foreign interference in our elections is obviously at odds with Trump's public embrace of "America First" policies. But hypocrisy is not illegal. Trump's appeals to foreign powers, though, could represent a serious violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), which prohibits anyone from soliciting or accepting anything of value from a foreign government to influence an election. The principle behind this law is fundamental to democratic self-governance.In the 1976 case Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court said the primary purpose of the campaign finance law is to "limit the actuality and appearance of corruption" that can arise from the potential influence that accompanies political contributions. This is the basis for federal restrictions on (and in some cases prohibitions against) political contributions by individuals, corporations or labor unions.The danger to democracy posed by such corruption is magnified when the influence over the US political process comes from foreign nationals. As then-US District Judge Brett Kavanaugh recognized in Bluman v. FEC, a 2011 opinion affirmed by the Supreme Court, there is a "compelling interest" for "limiting the participation of foreign citizens in activities of American democratic self-government." It is "part of the sovereign's obligation to preserve the basic conception of a political community," Kavanaugh wrote.That's why it is illegal for foreign nationals to make contributions to influence US elections and for anyone "to solicit (or) accept" a political contribution from a foreign national. The FEC defines "to solicit" as "to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly, that another person make a contribution ... or otherwise provide anything of value." If the value of the contribution is $25,000 or more, it is a felony."Anything of value," is a key part of this definition, and can include opposition research on your opponent. In his "Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election," special counsel Mueller recognized that "(a) foreign entity that engaged in (opposition) research and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things of value."What's the value of foreign assistance?By asking Zelensky to open an investigation into one of Trump's leading 2020 rivals, the President was soliciting something of value to help him get reelected.Nevertheless, it has been reported that the Justice Department, headed by Attorney General William Barr, reviewed the whistleblower complaint and decided not to investigate possible campaign finance law violations. Apparently, the Justice Department decided that "help with a government investigation could not be quantified as 'a thing of value' under the law," according to Washington Post reporting.This would be the second time federal prosecutors have decided not to prosecute anyone associated with the Trump campaign for illegally soliciting a contribution from a foreign government in the form of derogatory information on a political opponent because they were unable to determine the value of what was being solicited.The first time was when special counsel Mueller declined to prosecute Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort for soliciting or receiving a foreign contribution when they attended the 2016 meeting with Russian agents offering dirt on Clinton. According to the Mueller report, one of the reasons the special counsel's office decided not to prosecute was the "the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information." Nevertheless, Mueller made clear that "candidate-related opposition research given to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an election could constitute" a prohibited foreign contribution.While the Justice Department seems to have difficulty appraising the value of in-kind help from a foreign government, US law and FEC regulations deal with the issue clearly. For example, the federal definition of a campaign contribution includes "the payment ... of compensation for the personal services of another person ... without charge to a political committee for any purpose," excluding legal and accounting services.FEC regulations provide that "anything of value includes all in-kind contributions," such as "the provision of any goods or services without charge or at ... less than the usual and normal charge." This category includes "facilities, equipment, supplies, personnel." The usual and normal charge for any services is defined as "the hourly or piecework charge for the services at a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the services were rendered."The valuation question regularly arises when corporations not in the business of renting their facilities or staffing events allow their facilities, staff or services to be used for campaign activity. To avoid making a prohibited contribution, the corporation must comply with detailed FEC regulations. For example, with certain exceptions, if a corporation allows its facilities to be used for campaign activity, the campaign must reimburse that corporation for the normal and usual rental charge within a commercially reasonable time.As Mueller noted in his report, there are several ways you can determine the value of services provided by a foreign government, including by noting the normal charge for opposition research, or considering what it had cost to gather and provide the information at issue.Nevertheless, Mueller concluded that such information "would likely be unavailable or ineffective in this factual setting," by which he means the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower. According to Mueller, even after his investigation, it was not clear exactly what information the Russians were offering the Trump campaign, what the Trump campaign thought it was getting, how the Russians obtained the information or whether the information was obtained for the purpose of helping the campaign.Coming up with the numbersI disagreed with Mueller's decision not to charge the Trump campaign with a crime. Nevertheless, most of the problems Mueller identified in the June 2016 "factual setting" do not exist when assessing the value of a Ukrainian or Chinese investigation of Trump's political opponent. It's a different scenario from the 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Here, Trump is not responding to a vague offer of some negative information about his opponent. Rather, he's using the authority of his office to persuade the Ukrainian and Chinese governments to open official corruption investigations into Joe Biden and his son.In fact, it's not even clear whether the Justice Department made any effort to put a value on a Ukrainian corruption investigation into Trump's opponent. If the department were interested in determining whether Trump has committed a felony, all the Justice Department needs to determine is whether the value of what Trump sought from Ukraine amounted to more than $25,000.While there are several ways to go about an estimation, the most direct approach would be to ask the Ukrainian government how much a corruption investigation of this scale would cost. The Ukrainian government must have records of what it pays the staff in the prosecutor's office and is likely to have experience budgeting for investigations.The Mueller investigation cost an estimated $32 million. Even if a Ukrainian or Chinese investigation cost just one-tenth of 1% of the Mueller investigation, it would exceed the $25,000 threshold for a felony.Relying on the perceived difficulty of determining the exact value of the foreign help Trump is seeking is no longer an option for those charged with enforcing the law. Even though the Mueller report cautioned that soliciting opposition research by a foreign government could be illegal, Trump saw only green lights. To the surprise of many, he publicly refused to foreclose the option of listening to a foreign government offering to provide information to his 2020 campaign before alerting the FBI.We now know why.Soon after the Mueller report was publicly released, Trump crossed the line from being receptive to offers of foreign help to pressuring the President of Ukraine to launch an investigation that could help Trump's reelection campaign. And now the US President has publicly added China to the list of countries he is inviting to support his reelection.The Washington Post is now reporting that Trump sent Attorney General Barr overseas to meet with foreign intelligence officers from other countries to seek their help to discredit the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.It is foolish and dangerous to assume that Trump will not keep escalating his efforts to enlist foreign governments to help him win reelection. Trump has never worried about pushing the envelope when his self-interest is involved. Since he launched his campaign in 2015, his words and actions have reflected his belief that he is above the law. And now Trump has an attorney general who apparently sees himself as the President's protector.An uncertain futureIt appears Trump may have tied his solicitation of Ukraine to foreign aid. Now he is urging China to begin an investigation into Joe Biden while the two countries are engaged in trade negotiations.What kind of help might countries like China, Russia, North Korea and Saudi Arabia, whose leaders are hostile to democratic governments, be willing to offer to assure Trump's reelection? What influence would that help buy them with Trump? And what damage is being done to our relationships with allies who respect democratic values along with the rule of law if they are being asked to assist in the President's efforts to discredit his political opponents?There are other laws that are relevant to Trump's interactions with Ukraine. But we cannot lose focus on the importance of enforcing FECA's broad ban on anyone seeking or accepting foreign contributions to assist their election chances. As Judge Kavanaugh wrote in his 2011 Bluman decision:"Such measures have been a part of US campaign finance law for many years. The notion that Congress might lack the authority to distinguish foreigners from citizens in the regulation of electioneering would certainly have surprised the Framers, whose obsession with foreign influence derived from a fear that foreign powers and individuals had no basic investment in the well-being of the country."Load-Date: October 9, 2019End of Document

By normalizing foreign election interference, Trump makes a mockery of 'America First'CNN WireOctober 8, 2019 Tuesday 5:02 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 2173 wordsByline: Opinion by Larry NobleDateline: (CNN) BodyEditor's note: Larry Noble is the former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission (1987-2000).

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author; view more opinion at CNN. (CNN) --  President Donald Trump has exceeded expectations when it comes to ignoring the norms and laws of acting "presidential." He tells and repeats obvious lies, uses his office to promote his businesses, attacks the press for reporting the truth and rejects congressional oversight and attempts to obstruct lawful investigations. Some of these actions are gross violations of past norms and democratic values, while others potentially violate the law.

Dec: 1400Moving the MarketSector Watch-- Stock market trades little changed after yesterday's earnings-driven rally; relative weakness in software stocks-- Retail sales unexpectedly decline in September; uncertainty about Brexit, U.S.-China deals-- Earnings reports continue to come in mostly better than expectedStrong: Materials, Consumer Discretionary, FinancialsWeak: Information Technology, Real Estate12:55 ETDow -15.87 at 27008.93, Nasdaq -32.81 at 8115.9, S&P -7.29 at 2988.39[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session. The tech-sensitive Nasdaq is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 234.05, -1.27, -0.6%) and Netflix (NFLX 281.71, -2.53, -0.9%) trade lower, while Amazon (AMZN 1775.54, +8.17, +0.5%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1247.89, +4.88, +0.4%) trade higher. Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell. The stock is up nearly 11% since its close on Sept. 24.11:55 ETDow +22.81 at 27047.61, Nasdaq -15.99 at 8132.72, S&P -0.70 at 2994.98[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains little changed amid a general lack of conviction among buyers and sellers.In recent news, General Motors (GM 37.14, +0.88, +2.4%) and the UAW have agreed to a potential labor contract that could end the monthlong strike. The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today.

United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31. WTI crude declined 1.4%, or $0.76, to $53.55/bbl.Tuesday's economic data was limited to the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, which increased to 4.0 (Briefing.com consensus -1.0) from 2.0.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session. The tech-sensitive Nasdaq is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 234.05, -1.27, -0.6%) and Netflix (NFLX 281.71, -2.53, -0.9%) trade lower, while Amazon (AMZN 1775.54, +8.17, +0.5%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1247.89, +4.88, +0.4%) trade higher. Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell. The stock is up nearly 11% since its close on Sept. 24.11:55 ETDow +22.81 at 27047.61, Nasdaq -15.99 at 8132.72, S&P -0.70 at 2994.98[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains little changed amid a general lack of conviction among buyers and sellers.In recent news, General Motors (GM 37.14, +0.88, +2.4%) and the UAW have agreed to a potential labor contract that could end the monthlong strike. The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

Today, investors continue to assess incoming earnings reports, U.S.-China trade relations, and an elusive Brexit deal.Bank of America (BAC 30.37, +0.64, +2.2%) headlines today's batch of bank earnings, and results have come in better than expected. United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The House of Representative passed the bill, but it remains uncertain when the Senate would vote.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31. WTI crude declined 1.4%, or $0.76, to $53.55/bbl.Tuesday's economic data was limited to the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, which increased to 4.0 (Briefing.com consensus -1.0) from 2.0.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session. The tech-sensitive Nasdaq is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 234.05, -1.27, -0.6%) and Netflix (NFLX 281.71, -2.53, -0.9%) trade lower, while Amazon (AMZN 1775.54, +8.17, +0.5%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1247.89, +4.88, +0.4%) trade higher. Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell. The stock is up nearly 11% since its close on Sept. 24.11:55 ETDow +22.81 at 27047.61, Nasdaq -15.99 at 8132.72, S&P -0.70 at 2994.98[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains little changed amid a general lack of conviction among buyers and sellers.In recent news, General Motors (GM 37.14, +0.88, +2.4%) and the UAW have agreed to a potential labor contract that could end the monthlong strike. The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

Today, investors continue to assess incoming earnings reports, U.S.-China trade relations, and an elusive Brexit deal.Bank of America (BAC 30.37, +0.64, +2.2%) headlines today's batch of bank earnings, and results have come in better than expected. United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The House of Representative passed the bill, but it remains uncertain when the Senate would vote.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31. WTI crude declined 1.4%, or $0.76, to $53.55/bbl.Tuesday's economic data was limited to the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, which increased to 4.0 (Briefing.com consensus -1.0) from 2.0.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session. The tech-sensitive Nasdaq is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 234.05, -1.27, -0.6%) and Netflix (NFLX 281.71, -2.53, -0.9%) trade lower, while Amazon (AMZN 1775.54, +8.17, +0.5%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1247.89, +4.88, +0.4%) trade higher. Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell. The stock is up nearly 11% since its close on Sept. 24.11:55 ETDow +22.81 at 27047.61, Nasdaq -15.99 at 8132.72, S&P -0.70 at 2994.98[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains little changed amid a general lack of conviction among buyers and sellers.In recent news, General Motors (GM 37.14, +0.88, +2.4%) and the UAW have agreed to a potential labor contract that could end the monthlong strike. The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The House of Representative passed the bill, but it remains uncertain when the Senate would vote.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31. WTI crude declined 1.4%, or $0.76, to $53.55/bbl.Tuesday's economic data was limited to the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, which increased to 4.0 (Briefing.com consensus -1.0) from 2.0.

In sum, the Fed's Beige Book for October stated that the U.S. economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report, down from comments of modest growth in the September 4th report. Below are some additional highlights from the Fed's comments.Also, contacts in some Districts suggested that persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity. The early impact of a recent auto strike was limited. Freight shipments stabilized after falling during the previous reporting period.What's more, economic expansion is mostly expected to continue, however, many businesses lowered their outlooks for growth in the coming 6 to 12 months.On balance, employment rose slightly amid reports of persistent worker shortages though a number of Districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft.13:55 ETDow -18.23 at 27006.57, Nasdaq -33.92 at 8114.79, S&P -7.66 at 2988.02[BRIEFING.COM] The markets stand little changed in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still at the bottom, down 0.42%.Gold futures settled $10 higher (+0.7%) to $1,493.50/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index -0.3% 98.02.As a reminder, at the top of the hour the market will receive the Fed's Beige Book for October.13:30 ETDow -33.20 at 26991.6, Nasdaq -38.20 at 8110.51, S&P -9.59 at 2986.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have pushed to afternoon lows in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, too, pushing lower though to a lesser extent.Taking a brief look at the most active stocks today, the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.42, -1.00, -1.44%), UnitedHealth (UNH 235.35, -3.24, -1.36%), and Microsoft (MSFT 139.90, -1.67, -1.18%).Conversely, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 135.63, +2.79, +2.10%) sits at the top of the index.The DJIA now stands +0.28% on the month.12:55 ETDow -15.87 at 27008.93, Nasdaq -32.81 at 8115.9, S&P -7.29 at 2988.39[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session. The tech-sensitive Nasdaq is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 234.05, -1.27, -0.6%) and Netflix (NFLX 281.71, -2.53, -0.9%) trade lower, while Amazon (AMZN 1775.54, +8.17, +0.5%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1247.89, +4.88, +0.4%) trade higher. Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell. The stock is up nearly 11% since its close on Sept. 24.11:55 ETDow +22.81 at 27047.61, Nasdaq -15.99 at 8132.72, S&P -0.70 at 2994.98[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains little changed amid a general lack of conviction among buyers and sellers.In recent news, General Motors (GM 37.14, +0.88, +2.4%) and the UAW have agreed to a potential labor contract that could end the monthlong strike. The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

Today, investors continue to assess incoming earnings reports, U.S.-China trade relations, and an elusive Brexit deal.Bank of America (BAC 30.37, +0.64, +2.2%) headlines today's batch of bank earnings, and results have come in better than expected. United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The House of Representative passed the bill, but it remains uncertain when the Senate would vote. Elsewhere, some uncertainty remains on a modified Brexit deal despite reports yesterday indicating a draft deal was near.On the data front, investors will receive Retail Sales for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET, Business Inventories for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) at 10:00 a.m. ET, the Fed's Beige Book for October at 2:00 p.m. ET, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for August at 4:00 p.m. ET.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31.

This might be since retails sales were revised upwards to +0.6% from +0.4% in August, suggesting that the data from September might have been a natural pullback.Notable companies that will report earnings after today's close include IBM (IBM 142.28, -0.72, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 286.81, +2.60, +0.9%), and CSX (CSX 68.92, -0.26, -0.4%). Morgan Stanley (MS 42.89, +0.36, +0.8%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 50.36, -0.3, -0.1%), and Union Pacific (UNP 163.34, +0.20, +0.1%) are slated for tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -7.95 at 27016.85, Nasdaq -30.45 at 8118.26, S&P -6.68 at 2989[BRIEFING.COM] On the whole, treasury yields and the major averages held their losses following the Beige Book release. In sum, the Fed's Beige Book for October stated that the U.S. economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report, down from comments of modest growth in the September 4th report. Below are some additional highlights from the Fed's comments.Also, contacts in some Districts suggested that persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity. The early impact of a recent auto strike was limited. Freight shipments stabilized after falling during the previous reporting period.What's more, economic expansion is mostly expected to continue, however, many businesses lowered their outlooks for growth in the coming 6 to 12 months.On balance, employment rose slightly amid reports of persistent worker shortages though a number of Districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft.13:55 ETDow -18.23 at 27006.57, Nasdaq -33.92 at 8114.79, S&P -7.66 at 2988.02[BRIEFING.COM] The markets stand little changed in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still at the bottom, down 0.42%.Gold futures settled $10 higher (+0.7%) to $1,493.50/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index -0.3% 98.02.As a reminder, at the top of the hour the market will receive the Fed's Beige Book for October.13:30 ETDow -33.20 at 26991.6, Nasdaq -38.20 at 8110.51, S&P -9.59 at 2986.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have pushed to afternoon lows in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, too, pushing lower though to a lesser extent.Taking a brief look at the most active stocks today, the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.42, -1.00, -1.44%), UnitedHealth (UNH 235.35, -3.24, -1.36%), and Microsoft (MSFT 139.90, -1.67, -1.18%).Conversely, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 135.63, +2.79, +2.10%) sits at the top of the index.The DJIA now stands +0.28% on the month.12:55 ETDow -15.87 at 27008.93, Nasdaq -32.81 at 8115.9, S&P -7.29 at 2988.39[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session. The tech-sensitive Nasdaq is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 234.05, -1.27, -0.6%) and Netflix (NFLX 281.71, -2.53, -0.9%) trade lower, while Amazon (AMZN 1775.54, +8.17, +0.5%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1247.89, +4.88, +0.4%) trade higher. Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell. The stock is up nearly 11% since its close on Sept. 24.11:55 ETDow +22.81 at 27047.61, Nasdaq -15.99 at 8132.72, S&P -0.70 at 2994.98[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains little changed amid a general lack of conviction among buyers and sellers.In recent news, General Motors (GM 37.14, +0.88, +2.4%) and the UAW have agreed to a potential labor contract that could end the monthlong strike. The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

The People's Bank of China injected CNY200 bln of liquidity but left the medium-term lending facility rate unchanged at 3.3%.

Today, investors continue to assess incoming earnings reports, U.S.-China trade relations, and an elusive Brexit deal.Bank of America (BAC 30.37, +0.64, +2.2%) headlines today's batch of bank earnings, and results have come in better than expected. United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The House of Representative passed the bill, but it remains uncertain when the Senate would vote. Elsewhere, some uncertainty remains on a modified Brexit deal despite reports yesterday indicating a draft deal was near.On the data front, investors will receive Retail Sales for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET, Business Inventories for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) at 10:00 a.m. ET, the Fed's Beige Book for October at 2:00 p.m. ET, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for August at 4:00 p.m. ET.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31. WTI crude declined 1.4%, or $0.76, to $53.55/bbl.Tuesday's economic data was limited to the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, which increased to 4.0 (Briefing.com consensus -1.0) from 2.0.

This might be since retails sales were revised upwards to +0.6% from +0.4% in August, suggesting that the data from September might have been a natural pullback.Notable companies that will report earnings after today's close include IBM (IBM 142.28, -0.72, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 286.81, +2.60, +0.9%), and CSX (CSX 68.92, -0.26, -0.4%). Morgan Stanley (MS 42.89, +0.36, +0.8%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 50.36, -0.3, -0.1%), and Union Pacific (UNP 163.34, +0.20, +0.1%) are slated for tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -7.95 at 27016.85, Nasdaq -30.45 at 8118.26, S&P -6.68 at 2989[BRIEFING.COM] On the whole, treasury yields and the major averages held their losses following the Beige Book release. In sum, the Fed's Beige Book for October stated that the U.S. economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report, down from comments of modest growth in the September 4th report. Below are some additional highlights from the Fed's comments.Also, contacts in some Districts suggested that persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity. The early impact of a recent auto strike was limited. Freight shipments stabilized after falling during the previous reporting period.What's more, economic expansion is mostly expected to continue, however, many businesses lowered their outlooks for growth in the coming 6 to 12 months.On balance, employment rose slightly amid reports of persistent worker shortages though a number of Districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft.13:55 ETDow -18.23 at 27006.57, Nasdaq -33.92 at 8114.79, S&P -7.66 at 2988.02[BRIEFING.COM] The markets stand little changed in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still at the bottom, down 0.42%.Gold futures settled $10 higher (+0.7%) to $1,493.50/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index -0.3% 98.02.As a reminder, at the top of the hour the market will receive the Fed's Beige Book for October.13:30 ETDow -33.20 at 26991.6, Nasdaq -38.20 at 8110.51, S&P -9.59 at 2986.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have pushed to afternoon lows in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, too, pushing lower though to a lesser extent.Taking a brief look at the most active stocks today, the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.42, -1.00, -1.44%), UnitedHealth (UNH 235.35, -3.24, -1.36%), and Microsoft (MSFT 139.90, -1.67, -1.18%).Conversely, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 135.63, +2.79, +2.10%) sits at the top of the index.The DJIA now stands +0.28% on the month.12:55 ETDow -15.87 at 27008.93, Nasdaq -32.81 at 8115.9, S&P -7.29 at 2988.39[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session. The tech-sensitive Nasdaq is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 234.05, -1.27, -0.6%) and Netflix (NFLX 281.71, -2.53, -0.9%) trade lower, while Amazon (AMZN 1775.54, +8.17, +0.5%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1247.89, +4.88, +0.4%) trade higher. Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell. The stock is up nearly 11% since its close on Sept. 24.11:55 ETDow +22.81 at 27047.61, Nasdaq -15.99 at 8132.72, S&P -0.70 at 2994.98[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains little changed amid a general lack of conviction among buyers and sellers.In recent news, General Motors (GM 37.14, +0.88, +2.4%) and the UAW have agreed to a potential labor contract that could end the monthlong strike. The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

The People's Bank of China injected CNY200 bln of liquidity but left the medium-term lending facility rate unchanged at 3.3%. The Chinese government warned that "strong countermeasures" will be taken if the U.S. passes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The act was passed by the House last evening and it is expected to also clear the Senate. Bank of Korea lowered its repurchase rate by 25 bps to 1.25%, as expected.

United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The House of Representative passed the bill, but it remains uncertain when the Senate would vote. Elsewhere, some uncertainty remains on a modified Brexit deal despite reports yesterday indicating a draft deal was near.On the data front, investors will receive Retail Sales for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET, Business Inventories for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) at 10:00 a.m. ET, the Fed's Beige Book for October at 2:00 p.m. ET, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for August at 4:00 p.m. ET.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31. WTI crude declined 1.4%, or $0.76, to $53.55/bbl.Tuesday's economic data was limited to the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, which increased to 4.0 (Briefing.com consensus -1.0) from 2.0.

The benchmark index is currently down 0.2%.One last look inside the S&P 500 shows five sectors trading up and six sectors trading down, with most trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. Consumer discretionary (+0.4%) remains on top, while energy (-1.2%) falls behind.WTI crude futures settled up $0.63 (+1.2%) to $53.42/bbl to bounce back from yesterday's 1.4% drop.14:55 ETDow +13.13 at 27037.93, Nasdaq -21.66 at 8127.05, S&P -3.27 at 2992.41[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) has emerged as today's leader despite the unexpected decline in retail sales for September. This might be since retails sales were revised upwards to +0.6% from +0.4% in August, suggesting that the data from September might have been a natural pullback.Notable companies that will report earnings after today's close include IBM (IBM 142.28, -0.72, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 286.81, +2.60, +0.9%), and CSX (CSX 68.92, -0.26, -0.4%). Morgan Stanley (MS 42.89, +0.36, +0.8%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 50.36, -0.3, -0.1%), and Union Pacific (UNP 163.34, +0.20, +0.1%) are slated for tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -7.95 at 27016.85, Nasdaq -30.45 at 8118.26, S&P -6.68 at 2989[BRIEFING.COM] On the whole, treasury yields and the major averages held their losses following the Beige Book release. In sum, the Fed's Beige Book for October stated that the U.S. economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report, down from comments of modest growth in the September 4th report. Below are some additional highlights from the Fed's comments.Also, contacts in some Districts suggested that persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity. The early impact of a recent auto strike was limited. Freight shipments stabilized after falling during the previous reporting period.What's more, economic expansion is mostly expected to continue, however, many businesses lowered their outlooks for growth in the coming 6 to 12 months.On balance, employment rose slightly amid reports of persistent worker shortages though a number of Districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft.13:55 ETDow -18.23 at 27006.57, Nasdaq -33.92 at 8114.79, S&P -7.66 at 2988.02[BRIEFING.COM] The markets stand little changed in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still at the bottom, down 0.42%.Gold futures settled $10 higher (+0.7%) to $1,493.50/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index -0.3% 98.02.As a reminder, at the top of the hour the market will receive the Fed's Beige Book for October.13:30 ETDow -33.20 at 26991.6, Nasdaq -38.20 at 8110.51, S&P -9.59 at 2986.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have pushed to afternoon lows in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, too, pushing lower though to a lesser extent.Taking a brief look at the most active stocks today, the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.42, -1.00, -1.44%), UnitedHealth (UNH 235.35, -3.24, -1.36%), and Microsoft (MSFT 139.90, -1.67, -1.18%).Conversely, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 135.63, +2.79, +2.10%) sits at the top of the index.The DJIA now stands +0.28% on the month.12:55 ETDow -15.87 at 27008.93, Nasdaq -32.81 at 8115.9, S&P -7.29 at 2988.39[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session.

Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday.

JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market.

The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market.

The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors.

"People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher.

This might be since retails sales were revised upwards to +0.6% from +0.4% in August, suggesting that the data from September might have been a natural pullback.Notable companies that will report earnings after today's close include IBM (IBM 142.28, -0.72, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 286.81, +2.60, +0.9%), and CSX (CSX 68.92, -0.26, -0.4%).

In sum, the Fed's Beige Book for October stated that the U.S. economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report, down from comments of modest growth in the September 4th report. Below are some additional highlights from the Fed's comments.Also, contacts in some Districts suggested that persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity. The early impact of a recent auto strike was limited. Freight shipments stabilized after falling during the previous reporting period.What's more, economic expansion is mostly expected to continue, however, many businesses lowered their outlooks for growth in the coming 6 to 12 months.On balance, employment rose slightly amid reports of persistent worker shortages though a number of Districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft.13:55 ETDow -18.23 at 27006.57, Nasdaq -33.92 at 8114.79, S&P -7.66 at 2988.02[BRIEFING.COM] The markets stand little changed in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still at the bottom, down 0.42%.Gold futures settled $10 higher (+0.7%) to $1,493.50/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index -0.3% 98.02.As a reminder, at the top of the hour the market will receive the Fed's Beige Book for October.13:30 ETDow -33.20 at 26991.6, Nasdaq -38.20 at 8110.51, S&P -9.59 at 2986.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have pushed to afternoon lows in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, too, pushing lower though to a lesser extent.Taking a brief look at the most active stocks today, the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.42, -1.00, -1.44%), UnitedHealth (UNH 235.35, -3.24, -1.36%), and Microsoft (MSFT 139.90, -1.67, -1.18%).Conversely, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 135.63, +2.79, +2.10%) sits at the top of the index.The DJIA now stands +0.28% on the month.12:55 ETDow -15.87 at 27008.93, Nasdaq -32.81 at 8115.9, S&P -7.29 at 2988.39[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session.

The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%.

Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday.

JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%).

The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1496/1370. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1594/1467.15:25 ETDow -28.17 at 26996.63, Nasdaq -31.95 at 8116.76, S&P -7.19 at 2988.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has traded mostly in negative territory today and is on track to close slightly lower. The benchmark index is currently down 0.2%.One last look inside the S&P 500 shows five sectors trading up and six sectors trading down, with most trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. Consumer discretionary (+0.4%) remains on top, while energy (-1.2%) falls behind.WTI crude futures settled up $0.63 (+1.2%) to $53.42/bbl to bounce back from yesterday's 1.4% drop.14:55 ETDow +13.13 at 27037.93, Nasdaq -21.66 at 8127.05, S&P -3.27 at 2992.41[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) has emerged as today's leader despite the unexpected decline in retail sales for September. This might be since retails sales were revised upwards to +0.6% from +0.4% in August, suggesting that the data from September might have been a natural pullback.Notable companies that will report earnings after today's close include IBM (IBM 142.28, -0.72, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 286.81, +2.60, +0.9%), and CSX (CSX 68.92, -0.26, -0.4%). Morgan Stanley (MS 42.89, +0.36, +0.8%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 50.36, -0.3, -0.1%), and Union Pacific (UNP 163.34, +0.20, +0.1%) are slated for tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -7.95 at 27016.85, Nasdaq -30.45 at 8118.26, S&P -6.68 at 2989[BRIEFING.COM] On the whole, treasury yields and the major averages held their losses following the Beige Book release. In sum, the Fed's Beige Book for October stated that the U.S. economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report, down from comments of modest growth in the September 4th report. Below are some additional highlights from the Fed's comments.Also, contacts in some Districts suggested that persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity. The early impact of a recent auto strike was limited. Freight shipments stabilized after falling during the previous reporting period.What's more, economic expansion is mostly expected to continue, however, many businesses lowered their outlooks for growth in the coming 6 to 12 months.On balance, employment rose slightly amid reports of persistent worker shortages though a number of Districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft.13:55 ETDow -18.23 at 27006.57, Nasdaq -33.92 at 8114.79, S&P -7.66 at 2988.02[BRIEFING.COM] The markets stand little changed in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still at the bottom, down 0.42%.Gold futures settled $10 higher (+0.7%) to $1,493.50/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index -0.3% 98.02.As a reminder, at the top of the hour the market will receive the Fed's Beige Book for October.13:30 ETDow -33.20 at 26991.6, Nasdaq -38.20 at 8110.51, S&P -9.59 at 2986.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have pushed to afternoon lows in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, too, pushing lower though to a lesser extent.Taking a brief look at the most active stocks today, the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.42, -1.00, -1.44%), UnitedHealth (UNH 235.35, -3.24, -1.36%), and Microsoft (MSFT 139.90, -1.67, -1.18%).Conversely, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 135.63, +2.79, +2.10%) sits at the top of the index.The DJIA now stands +0.28% on the month.12:55 ETDow -15.87 at 27008.93, Nasdaq -32.81 at 8115.9, S&P -7.29 at 2988.39[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August.

The tech-sensitive Nasdaq is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 234.05, -1.27, -0.6%) and Netflix (NFLX 281.71, -2.53, -0.9%) trade lower, while Amazon (AMZN 1775.54, +8.17, +0.5%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1247.89, +4.88, +0.4%) trade higher. Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell.

The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%.

Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday.

JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%).

The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

The People's Bank of China injected CNY200 bln of liquidity but left the medium-term lending facility rate unchanged at 3.3%. The Chinese government warned that "strong countermeasures" will be taken if the U.S. passes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31. WTI crude declined 1.4%, or $0.76, to $53.55/bbl.Tuesday's economic data was limited to the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, which increased to 4.0 (Briefing.com consensus -1.0) from 2.0.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1496/1370. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1594/1467.15:25 ETDow -28.17 at 26996.63, Nasdaq -31.95 at 8116.76, S&P -7.19 at 2988.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has traded mostly in negative territory today and is on track to close slightly lower. The benchmark index is currently down 0.2%.One last look inside the S&P 500 shows five sectors trading up and six sectors trading down, with most trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. Consumer discretionary (+0.4%) remains on top, while energy (-1.2%) falls behind.WTI crude futures settled up $0.63 (+1.2%) to $53.42/bbl to bounce back from yesterday's 1.4% drop.14:55 ETDow +13.13 at 27037.93, Nasdaq -21.66 at 8127.05, S&P -3.27 at 2992.41[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) has emerged as today's leader despite the unexpected decline in retail sales for September. This might be since retails sales were revised upwards to +0.6% from +0.4% in August, suggesting that the data from September might have been a natural pullback.Notable companies that will report earnings after today's close include IBM (IBM 142.28, -0.72, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 286.81, +2.60, +0.9%), and CSX (CSX 68.92, -0.26, -0.4%). Morgan Stanley (MS 42.89, +0.36, +0.8%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 50.36, -0.3, -0.1%), and Union Pacific (UNP 163.34, +0.20, +0.1%) are slated for tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -7.95 at 27016.85, Nasdaq -30.45 at 8118.26, S&P -6.68 at 2989[BRIEFING.COM] On the whole, treasury yields and the major averages held their losses following the Beige Book release. In sum, the Fed's Beige Book for October stated that the U.S. economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report, down from comments of modest growth in the September 4th report. Below are some additional highlights from the Fed's comments.Also, contacts in some Districts suggested that persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity. The early impact of a recent auto strike was limited. Freight shipments stabilized after falling during the previous reporting period.What's more, economic expansion is mostly expected to continue, however, many businesses lowered their outlooks for growth in the coming 6 to 12 months.On balance, employment rose slightly amid reports of persistent worker shortages though a number of Districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft.13:55 ETDow -18.23 at 27006.57, Nasdaq -33.92 at 8114.79, S&P -7.66 at 2988.02[BRIEFING.COM] The markets stand little changed in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still at the bottom, down 0.42%.Gold futures settled $10 higher (+0.7%) to $1,493.50/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index -0.3% 98.02.As a reminder, at the top of the hour the market will receive the Fed's Beige Book for October.13:30 ETDow -33.20 at 26991.6, Nasdaq -38.20 at 8110.51, S&P -9.59 at 2986.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have pushed to afternoon lows in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, too, pushing lower though to a lesser extent.Taking a brief look at the most active stocks today, the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.42, -1.00, -1.44%), UnitedHealth (UNH 235.35, -3.24, -1.36%), and Microsoft (MSFT 139.90, -1.67, -1.18%).Conversely, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 135.63, +2.79, +2.10%) sits at the top of the index.The DJIA now stands +0.28% on the month.12:55 ETDow -15.87 at 27008.93, Nasdaq -32.81 at 8115.9, S&P -7.29 at 2988.39[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session. The tech-sensitive Nasdaq is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 234.05, -1.27, -0.6%) and Netflix (NFLX 281.71, -2.53, -0.9%) trade lower, while Amazon (AMZN 1775.54, +8.17, +0.5%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1247.89, +4.88, +0.4%) trade higher. Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell. The stock is up nearly 11% since its close on Sept. 24.11:55 ETDow +22.81 at 27047.61, Nasdaq -15.99 at 8132.72, S&P -0.70 at 2994.98[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains little changed amid a general lack of conviction among buyers and sellers.In recent news, General Motors (GM 37.14, +0.88, +2.4%) and the UAW have agreed to a potential labor contract that could end the monthlong strike. The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

The People's Bank of China injected CNY200 bln of liquidity but left the medium-term lending facility rate unchanged at 3.3%. The Chinese government warned that "strong countermeasures" will be taken if the U.S. passes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The act was passed by the House last evening and it is expected to also clear the Senate. Bank of Korea lowered its repurchase rate by 25 bps to 1.25%, as expected. The central bank signaled that GDP and CPI forecasts will be cut once the market receives data for Q3.In economic data: South Korea's September Unemployment Rate 3.4% (expected 3.9%; last 3.1%).

There is still some uncertainty regarding the viability of the modified Brexit deal. EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to provide a briefing to EU ambassadors around 10:00 ET.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1496/1370. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1594/1467.15:25 ETDow -28.17 at 26996.63, Nasdaq -31.95 at 8116.76, S&P -7.19 at 2988.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has traded mostly in negative territory today and is on track to close slightly lower. The benchmark index is currently down 0.2%.One last look inside the S&P 500 shows five sectors trading up and six sectors trading down, with most trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. Consumer discretionary (+0.4%) remains on top, while energy (-1.2%) falls behind.WTI crude futures settled up $0.63 (+1.2%) to $53.42/bbl to bounce back from yesterday's 1.4% drop.14:55 ETDow +13.13 at 27037.93, Nasdaq -21.66 at 8127.05, S&P -3.27 at 2992.41[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) has emerged as today's leader despite the unexpected decline in retail sales for September. This might be since retails sales were revised upwards to +0.6% from +0.4% in August, suggesting that the data from September might have been a natural pullback.Notable companies that will report earnings after today's close include IBM (IBM 142.28, -0.72, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 286.81, +2.60, +0.9%), and CSX (CSX 68.92, -0.26, -0.4%). Morgan Stanley (MS 42.89, +0.36, +0.8%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 50.36, -0.3, -0.1%), and Union Pacific (UNP 163.34, +0.20, +0.1%) are slated for tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow -7.95 at 27016.85, Nasdaq -30.45 at 8118.26, S&P -6.68 at 2989[BRIEFING.COM] On the whole, treasury yields and the major averages held their losses following the Beige Book release. In sum, the Fed's Beige Book for October stated that the U.S. economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report, down from comments of modest growth in the September 4th report. Below are some additional highlights from the Fed's comments.Also, contacts in some Districts suggested that persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity. The early impact of a recent auto strike was limited. Freight shipments stabilized after falling during the previous reporting period.What's more, economic expansion is mostly expected to continue, however, many businesses lowered their outlooks for growth in the coming 6 to 12 months.On balance, employment rose slightly amid reports of persistent worker shortages though a number of Districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft.13:55 ETDow -18.23 at 27006.57, Nasdaq -33.92 at 8114.79, S&P -7.66 at 2988.02[BRIEFING.COM] The markets stand little changed in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still at the bottom, down 0.42%.Gold futures settled $10 higher (+0.7%) to $1,493.50/oz.The U.S. Dollar Index -0.3% 98.02.As a reminder, at the top of the hour the market will receive the Fed's Beige Book for October.13:30 ETDow -33.20 at 26991.6, Nasdaq -38.20 at 8110.51, S&P -9.59 at 2986.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have pushed to afternoon lows in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, too, pushing lower though to a lesser extent.Taking a brief look at the most active stocks today, the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Exxon Mobil (XOM 68.42, -1.00, -1.44%), UnitedHealth (UNH 235.35, -3.24, -1.36%), and Microsoft (MSFT 139.90, -1.67, -1.18%).Conversely, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 135.63, +2.79, +2.10%) sits at the top of the index.The DJIA now stands +0.28% on the month.12:55 ETDow -15.87 at 27008.93, Nasdaq -32.81 at 8115.9, S&P -7.29 at 2988.39[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market currently trades mixed, as it balances positive reactions to earnings reports with negative macro news. The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.4%) are down modestly, while the Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades higher.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday to a good start, and results today have continued to come in mostly better than expected. Notable earnings gainers include Bank of America (BAC 30.34, +0.61, +2.0%), United Airlines (UAL 90.09, +2.21, +2.5%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 116.90, +5.30, +4.8%). It should be noted that expectations were not high.Unlike yesterday, though, when each of the major averages rose about 1% apiece, the results today have not been enough to stir conviction in the market. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are within 0.3% of their flat lines, while software stocks drag on the information technology sector (-0.9%). The lightly-weighted materials sector (+0.7%) outperforms.The lack of enthusiasm might be stemming from an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), a contention from Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) that no more rate cuts are needed this year, and some negative-sounding news on the Brexit and U.S.-China fronts.Reportedly, there are still some hurdles in reaching a Brexit deal by Oct. 31 while China has threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Kong. China's response came after the U.S. House of Representatives approved those measures yesterday, and the situation could complicate China's willingness to commit to the first phase of the trade deal with the U.S.There's been news of other possible deals, too. General Motors (GM 36.99, +0.71, +2.0%) and the UAW reached a tentative deal to end the monthlong strike. The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1498/1330. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1587/1400.12:25 ETDow -0.49 at 27024.31, Nasdaq -23.55 at 8125.16, S&P -3.93 at 2991.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.1% in this tight-ranged session. The tech-sensitive Nasdaq is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 234.05, -1.27, -0.6%) and Netflix (NFLX 281.71, -2.53, -0.9%) trade lower, while Amazon (AMZN 1775.54, +8.17, +0.5%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1247.89, +4.88, +0.4%) trade higher. Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell. The stock is up nearly 11% since its close on Sept. 24.11:55 ETDow +22.81 at 27047.61, Nasdaq -15.99 at 8132.72, S&P -0.70 at 2994.98[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains little changed amid a general lack of conviction among buyers and sellers.In recent news, General Motors (GM 37.14, +0.88, +2.4%) and the UAW have agreed to a potential labor contract that could end the monthlong strike. The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%).

The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today.

Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors.

"People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher.

Huawei considers selling access to its 5G techFierceWirelessSeptember 12, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 573 wordsByline: Bevin FletcherHighlight: As Huawei finds itself at odds with the U.S. government, Ren Zhengfei, chief executive of the Chinese telecom giant, disclosed he is willing to sell access to its existing 5G technologies to a buyer in the West, The Economist reported. BodyAs Huawei finds itself at odds with the U.S. government, Ren Zhengfei, chief executive of the Chinese telecom giant, disclosed he is willing to sell access to the company'sexisting 5G technologies to a buyer in the West, The Economist reported.The acquirer would make a one-time payment to gain continuous access to Huawei's current 5G portfolio of patents, licenses, code, technical blueprints, and production knowledge, Huawei's CEO told the magazine in an interview.Both Huawei and the buyer would then be free to change the source code and further develop the technology for their own respective interests.RELATED: Huawei's inventory bubble soon may burstHuawei's existing contracts would remain in place and it would continue to sell its own 5G equipment. But, the company's chief told the Economist that the goal would be to create a 5G competitor, with the aim of allaying concerns over Huawei's 5G market dominance.“A balanced distribution of interests is conducive to Huawei's survival,” Ren told The Economist.There's also the issue of concerns over national security risks, raised by the U.S., who has warned thatHuawei could act as a spying apparatus for the Chinese government. Huawei has continued to deny allegations.Who the buyer would be is unclear other than an entity based in “the West.”Ren said he had “no idea” who might purchase access to the Huawei technologies. What amount Huawei would charge also remains unknown, though The Economist noted that if sold, the value of Huawei's entire 5G technology portfolio could hit tens of billions of dollars.As a trade warbetween the United States and China wages on, Huawei has remained embroiled in the tension.The U.S. blacklisted Huawei in May, banning American companies from selling tech components and software to the Chinese vendor, though the government has granted two 90-day extensions.RELATED: U.S., Poland sign 5G pact as Huawei concerns persistThe ban includes Google's proprietary Android operating system used in Huawei's smartphones, importantly including the Google Play Store, which is needed to download popular apps. Huawei plans to launch its new flagship phone the Mate 30 later this month, but with the U.S. ban in effect the new phones won't be able to run Google's proprietary software or have the basic features consumers now expect. In addition to barring U.S. government agencies from using Huawei gear, the Trump administration has pressed allies around the world to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation networks.Earlier this month U.S. Vice President Michael Pence met with Poland's leaders, and signed a pact for 5G equipment security, and while meeting with leaders in Ireland reiterated warnings against using Huawei.“It is well known that Chinese law requires Chinese telecom companies to provide Beijing's vast security apparatus with access to any data that touches their network,” said Pence. “And, we believein the United Statesthat there's no place for untrusted vendors anywhere in our secure 5G supply chain.“We're working with telecom companies across the world to develop 5G alternatives to Huawei,” Pence added. Huawei recently accused the U.S. of trying to disrupt its business through cyberattacks and law enforcement instructed to “menace” employees, according to the WSJ.It remains to be seen whether China would even sign off on Ren's proposal, or if it would make any impact on Huawei's relations with the U.S.Load-Date: September 13, 2019End of Document

The Commerce Department says the technology is being used to repress China's Muslim minority groups.The blacklist effectively bars U.S. firms from selling technology to the Chinese companies without government approval.Separately, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league is not apologizing for Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's since-deleted tweet showing support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, even after China's state broadcaster canceled plans to show a pair of preseason games in that country later this week.Silver is going to Shanghai on Wednesday and said he hopes to meet with officials and some of the league's business partners there in an effort to find some sort of common ground.Trade representatives from the U.S. and China are expected to meet this week for talks, though reports suggest that the discussions will be narrow in scope. Analysts say prospects for a significant breakthrough are scant.Markets in the Chinese mainland resumed trading after a weeklong holiday, with the Shanghai Composite climbing 0.3% to 2,913.57.Hong Kong shares closed higher despite a bleak assessment by Chief Executive Carrie Lam of the impact of months of increasingly violent protests on the city's economy.Addressing reporters after a long weekend of more turmoil, Lam said tourism arrivals were down by half and that hotels and retailers were suffering.Hong Kong's third quarter economic data will definitely be "very bad", she said.Elsewhere, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 1.0% to 21,587.78 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.5% to 6,593.40.

Analysts say prospects for a significant breakthrough are scant.Markets in the Chinese mainland resumed trading after a weeklong holiday, with the Shanghai Composite climbing 0.3% to 2,913.57.Hong Kong shares closed higher despite a bleak assessment by Chief Executive Carrie Lam of the impact of months of increasingly violent protests on the city's economy.Addressing reporters after a long weekend of more turmoil, Lam said tourism arrivals were down by half and that hotels and retailers were suffering.Hong Kong's third quarter economic data will definitely be "very bad", she said.Elsewhere, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 1.0% to 21,587.78 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.5% to 6,593.40.

China says economy grows up 6% in 3rd trim.; its slightest advance since 1990CE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 18, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 257 wordsBodyChina's economy grew 6% in the third quarter of 2019 against the same period in 2018, its lowest growth since the early 1990s, reported National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the agency responsible for collecting the economic figures of the second the world's largest economy, in a statement.The consensus of analysts surveyed by the financial portal Investing.com expected a slightly higher progress of 6.1%, in the July-September period against the same period of the previous year.In quarter-to-quarter terms, China recorded growth of 1.5% in the third quarter of 2019 against the second quarter of the same year, added NBS, a breakthrough identical to that estimated by analysts.Moreover, in the first three quarters of the year, the economy grew 6.2% against the first three quarters of 2018, added NBS.The Chinese government, in the face of lower growth, said that either way the economy maintains signs of good performance."Despite increasing downward pressure on economic growth, major economic indicators remained in a reasonable range," said Mao Shengyong, a spokesman for the statistics office, citing employment and inflation that remained excluding energy and food prices.As far as industrial production is concerned, this indicator rose 5.8% in the first three quarters of 2019 against the same period of 2018, more than expected by the consensus of analysts surveyed by Investing.com, which was a growth of 5.0%.Finally, retail sales grew 8.2% in the first three months of 2018 against the same period of 2018, NBSC said.Load-Date: January 24, 2020End of Document

The main topic of the speech is integrating the 'Old' and 'New' economies, yet he wrapped things up with some thoughts on the Fed's policy course.Key takeaways in that regard include:An acknowledgment that the time is upon us to increase the Fed's securities holdings to maintain an appropriate level of reserves in order to keep volatility in the wholesale funding markets in check. Mr. Powell was quick to note that the impending growth of its balance sheet "...should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchases programs that we deployed after the financial crisis."Translation: Don't think of this as a "QE" operation. It is geared only to ensure that there is an appropriate level of reserves to meet cash needs. The purchases will be concentrated in T-bills and should not materially affect the stance of monetary policy.He again highlighted risks to the favorable outlook, calling attention to weaker growth around the world, uncertainties surrounding trade, Brexit, and other issues.Mr. Powell stressed that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision-making process and that policy is not on a preset course. He added, though, that the Fed will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion and meet its dual mandate.By and large, there were no real policy surprises in the speech. The stock market, however, might have liked the idea that he didn't take the opportunity to give a telltale hint that a rate cut in October is unlikely to happen. He left the door open there in reiterating the Fed's data-dependent nature.The stock market, which was in a rebound mode ahead of the speech, has continued that rebound effort. The S&P 500, down 1.4% at its low this morning, is now down 0.5% for the day.14:33AJRD Aerojet Rocketdyne teams with NASA to develop novel rocket engine technology (48.50 +0.36)Aerojet Rocketdyne has entered into a Space Act Agreement with NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center to design and manufacture a lightweight rocket engine thrust chamber assembly using innovative additive manufacturing processes and materials. The goal of the project is to reduce manufacturing costs and make a thrust chamber that is easily scalable to support a variety of missions, including America's return to the Moon and subsequent missions to explore Mars.Aerojet Rocketdyne will use a unique combination of 3D printing technologies -- including solid state deposition and laser deposition -- to enable rapid fabrication of complex components. The vertical integration of these robotic additive manufacturing techniques is expected to yield a scalable design that could be applied to propulsion systems ranging from small systems that would support a lunar lander, all the way up to large boosters that enable launch vehicles to escape Earth's gravity.14:29SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Qiagen (QGEN) underperforms following preliminary third quarter press, CEO departure -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersNG (6.76 +4.88%): Gold names and select metals peers show relative strength amid general market weakness.

Since its March 21 IPO, LEVI has reported earnings twice. Last quarter, the company generated Non-GAAP EPS of $0.17 vs. the $0.12 consensus, posted inline revenue of $1.3 bln (+5.4% yr/yr), and also slightly raised its FY19 guidance.Specifically, it guided for Adj EBITDA margin improvement up to +10 bps from "flat to slightly higher", and constant currency net revenue growth to the "high end of mid-single digit range" from "mid single digits."Heading into tonight's report, the stock has been on a nice roll, climbing by 22% from the post-IPO lows hit in mid-August. The upswing suggests that investors are anticipating another good earnings report from LEVI.For the quarter, analysts are expecting LEVI to report Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 on revenue of $1.44 bln. It's worth noting that last quarter LEVI did not provide an Adjusted EPS number in its earnings press release. Adjusted net income and shares outstanding were provided, allowing for a Non-GAAP EPS number to be calculated.However, following the earnings release, the financial media honed in on the readily available GAAP EPS number, which came up short of expectations at $0.07 vs. the $0.08 consensus.The differing numbers created some initial confusion and volatility in the stock and is something to keep in mind should the same circumstance arise tonight.Competition and evolving consumer shopping habits have created a very challenging environment for retailers -- especially for those that are heavily reliant on brick-and-mortar stores. It is estimated that about 15-20% of LEVI's business is generated from U.S. department stores. Last quarter, LEVI's wholesale business grew by a scant 3% compared to 5% in Q1.Its exposure to department stores is fairly significant, but so far LEVI has done a good job of mitigating the soft performance in department stores by bolstering its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel, expanding internationally, and broadening its product lines to include more tops and women's categories.For instance, last quarter the DTC channel grew 14% and now represents at least 10% of the total business compared to just 4% early this year. Furthermore, LEVI's women's business was up 18% in Q2, marking the 15th straight quarter of growth for that category.The main question going forward is whether LEVI can continue to drive healthy revenue growth and margin expansion while the Americas region (+3% growth in Q2) continues to struggle due to weakness at U.S. department stores.While the company hasn't provided quarterly guidance in its earnings press releases, it might provide an updated outlook for FY19 Adj. EBITDA margin and constant currency net revenue growth.12:59VHC VirnetX Holding says prevails in appeals court as mandate issued in Apple (AAPL) suit (6.05 +0.09)The co announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the "Federal Circuit") has issued a formal mandate in the Federal Circuit case 2018-1197 (the "1197 Case") titled "Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in No. 6:10-cv-00417-RWS, Judge Robert Schroeder, III" (the "Apple I" case), in accordance with the judgment of the Federal Circuit, entered on January 15, 2019, affirming the judgement issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in this case.12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks down broadly as trade concerns growThe major averages on Wall Street are down noticeably today after the U.S. placed 28 more Chinese organizations on its trade blacklist. The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:50 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.12:50QGEN Qiagen leading med-tech/device stocks lower after warning about sales, citing significantly weaker-than-expected developments in China (25.43 -6.62)Qiagen also partner with Illumina (ILMN) for sequencing-based In-Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) tests and announced the departure of its CEO.Genomics/med-tech: PSNL -6.79% ADPT -6.74% NVTA -4.04% ILMN -3.58% Medical devices: WAT -6.13% BSX -5.89% TMO -5.83% PKI -5.18% A -2.86% MTD -2.76%12:30SDC SmileDirectClub slides 11% to fresh lows as recent IPOs remain under pressure (12.02 -1.47)Recent IPOs seeing similar relative weakness: JMIA -8.07%, ADPT -7.32%, PSNL -6.71%, SNDL -6.19%, STOK -6.06%, TCRR -5.93%, RVLV -5.35%, PRVL -5.00%, PTON -4.81% PLAN -4.80%, KRTX -4.79%, HARP -4.76%, LVGO -4.73%, HCAT -4.64%, CRWD -4.45%, THOR -4.38%, LK -4.28%, BBIO -3.97%, TWST -3.82%, etc...Of note for SDC, shares closed down 8% yesterday despite a wave of bullish analyst initiations upon expiration of the quiet period. Perhaps driven by the ongoing selling pressure on shares and resulting underperformance following September's IPO, SDC yesterday responded to the initiations, declaring that they reinforce the value of their business model, unit economics and mission:"Today's market reports reinforce the value of our business model, unit economics and mission to transform smiles through safe, affordable and consumer-first technology to an addressable market of approximately 500 million people worldwide. We remain focused on long term shareholder value - the next 12, 24, 36 months and beyond. Our entrance into the public market allows us to reinvest in innovation, process improvements, international growth and customer experience. Our commitment to our 5,500 team members, our customers and our mission is stronger than ever."12:20SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- NIO (NIO) improves following third quarter delivery results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersNIO (1.69 +9.03%): Provided a Q3 delivery update; co delivered 4,799 vehicles in the quarter, increasing +35.1% sequentially and exceeding the midpoint of co's guidance range by 499 vehicles, or +11.6%. Deliveries of the ES6 models "continued to ramp up"; 4,196 vehicles of the model were reported for the quarter. September deliveries were positively impacted ahead of China's national day holiday. Co also noted that it has seen accelerated growth of its order backlog since September. It is updating its retail pricing and battery pack offerings and will continue to "further enhance [its] offerings in an effort to accelerate orders and deliveries, going forward." NAT (3.27 +6.17%): Upgraded to Buy from Neutral and assigned a $4 price target at BTIG Research. The stock, which has advanced alongside shipping/tanker peers during sector outperformance in recent sessions, sees continued strength on more than 3x average volume, today generally outperforming peer names. At ten-month highs. HA (26.56 +5.36%): Reported upside September traffic stats -- total traffic increased +3.0% yr/yr on a +0.7% increase in capacity, with load factor increasing 1.9 points to 85.5% -- and raised its estimates for operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM), due to better than expected yields in long-haul markets, particularly in its International entity. Co also narrowed its estimates for operating cost per ASM ex. fuel and non-recurring items and for estimates for gallons of jet fuel consumer, and it lowered its estimates for economic fuel cost per gallon.Small Cap LosersPBYI (8.05 -20.06%): Downgraded to Sell from Neutral and price target cut to $8 from $24 at Goldman; hearing that the firm cites headline risk presented by upcoming competitive data from Seattle Genetics' (SGEN) tucatinib in the HER2-positive breast cancer space for the downgrade. Co also disclosed that its Chief Commercial Officer, Steven Lo, has decided to resign, effective October 18, in order to accept a CEO position at Zosano Pharma (ZSAN). At all-time lows. AZZ (36.74 -14.58%): Co's Q2 earnings report had been scheduled to be released this morning, but co instead announced today that it is rescheduling -- and thus, delaying -- its Q2 earnings release in order to grant co "additional time to complete the review of its Form 10-Q" for the quarter; co will announce the specific date and time of the rescheduled earnings call upon completion of the review. At multi-year lows. AMBA (51.57 -9.87%): The Department of Commerce added a number of Chinese organizations to its Entity List, including video surveillance companies Hikvision and Dahua Technology, which are major customers for co's components -- according to Needham, which downgraded co in June citing Entity List risk and which now reiterates its Underperform rating, the two customers accounted for 20-25% of co's total revenue over the past few quarters. The stock moves to its lowest levels since co issued upside Q3 revenue guidance in its Q2 earnings report.12:09PBYI Puma Biotech. plummets 21% to all-time lows after Goldman downgrades to Sell (cutting price target to $8 (from $24)) and Chief Commercial Officer Steven Lo resigns to pursue another opportunity (7.95 -2.12)11:48BA Boeing reported Q3 commercial airplane deliveries down 67% to 63; 737s down 91% to 5 (370.07 -6.47)Boeing reports this data monthly as well.11:41ASPS Altisource Portfolio Solutions to wind down and close Owners.com's operations (19.67 -0.40)The Company believes that closing Owners.com supports its simplification strategy, eliminates the cash burn associated with this earlier stage business, and increases focus on the core real estate and mortgage businesses.

Video surveillance/facial recognition companies Hikvision and Dahua are among the newly blacklisted entities, alongside companies that work on artificial intelligence technologies.The news has caused broad-based weakness among chipmakers. There are currently 12 members of the SOX index showing losses of 3.0% or more. Interestingly, companies that are known for doing business with Hikvision and Dahua are not leading today's retreat. For instance, Intel (INTC 49.89, -0.73, -1.5%) is the second-best performer in the group while names like AMD (AMD 28.14, -0.79, -2.7%), NVIDIA (NVDA 177.96, -6.37, -3.4%), and Qualcomm (QCOM 73.53, -2.81, -3.6%) show losses between 2.7% and 3.6%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 47.90, -0.05, -0.1%) trades just below its flat line after notching a fresh record at the start of today's session. At this time, it may seem that the Taiwan-based company is shielded from being dragged into the conflict with China, but the contract chip manufacturer could see a decrease in orders if U.S. chipmakers are prevented from selling components to Chinese companies. Furthermore, there is also a risk that China could try to strengthen its grip over Taiwan and block TSM from fabricating chips for U.S. companies.10:18TALKX Market Briefing: Trade and growth concerns at heart of early selling interestIt's not a pretty picture in the stock market this morning. Every sector is lower, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 10% to 19.57, and the S&P 500 has dropped further below its 50-day moving average (2938.44).The negative price action is primarily a function of trade concerns, which ratcheted up following some awkward timing by the Department of Commerce in naming 19 Chinese governmental, and eight commercial, firms to its Entity List on the basis of their part in fostering human rights violations against Muslim ethnic minorities in China.That news hit last night and immediately created a diplomatic rift in front of this week's trade negotiations in Washington between senior U.S. and China trade officials. China for its part warned it will retaliate.Accordingly, a sense of nervousness ahead of those talks has fueled broad-based selling interest. The selling activity is predicated not just on a belief that the trade talks this week will be disappointing, but that the latest developments will keep a planned tariff rate increase from 25% to 30% on $250 billion worth of imported Chinese goods on track to be implemented October 15.The more general view of matters, and seemingly negative turn of events, is that the trade uncertainty is a negative for growth and earnings prospects alike.The biggest losers thus far are the financial (-1.8%), health care (-1.6%), information technology (-1.5%), and industrials (-1.4%) sectors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.1%; the S&P 500 is down 1.3%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.3%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.6%.10:10OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:WDC Oct 60 calls are seeing interest with 2560 contracts trading vs. open int of 1010, pushing implied vol up around 3 points to ~44%.

The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are off currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-x%) has been getting hit hard, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:50 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 739/1044. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 728/2268.12:30 ETDow -227.68 at 26250.34, Nasdaq -83.00 at 7873.3, S&P -31.08 at 2907.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 1.1% alongside the tech-sensitive Nasdaq.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96. WTI crude is down 1.1% to $52.15/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -45.50.The stock market is on track for a noticeably lower open, as new trade developments cast some doubt on this week's trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Differences between views on human rights appears to be the latest dispute between the countries. The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:50 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 739/1044. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 728/2268.12:30 ETDow -227.68 at 26250.34, Nasdaq -83.00 at 7873.3, S&P -31.08 at 2907.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 1.1% alongside the tech-sensitive Nasdaq.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96. WTI crude is down 1.1% to $52.15/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -45.50.The stock market is on track for a noticeably lower open, as new trade developments cast some doubt on this week's trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Differences between views on human rights appears to be the latest dispute between the countries. The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain. The index rallied to begin the day but backed off its session high after the release of a weaker than expected Caixin Services PMI (actual 51.3; expected 52.1; last 52.1).

As for trade talks, the South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese delegation could go home from the negotiations one day early as expectations are falling for any resolution to the trade dispute.In other matters, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that a Brexit deal is "overwhelmingly unlikely" if Northern Ireland doesn't stay in the customs union.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The trio now stand -0.82%, -0.84%, and -0.55%, respectively.Gold futures settled lost $0.50 (-0.0%) on Tuesday to $1,503.90/oz, giving up afternoon gains which were fueled in part by trade uncertainty, after the greenback surged to a near one-week high.The U.S. Dollar Index holds near a one-week high, +0.2%, at 99.17.13:30 ETDow -145.51 at 26332.51, Nasdaq -71.74 at 7884.56, S&P -24.73 at 2914.1[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are attempting to return to session highs in recent action with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosting the shallowest losses, down 0.55%.The worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.61, -1.16, -2.43%), Dow (DOW 44.34, -0.83, -1.84%), and IBM (IBM 139.01, -2.27, -1.61%) despite a dearth of corporate news.Conversely, big box retail giant Walmart (WMT 118.12, +0.89, +0.76%) sits atop the index.The DJIA gives back all of Friday's recovery, now -2.17% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.413% on a bid-to-cover of 2.43.12:55 ETDow -151.85 at 26326.17, Nasdaq -69.41 at 7886.89, S&P -24.70 at 2914.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages on Wall Street are down noticeably today after the U.S. placed 28 more Chinese organizations on its trade blacklist. The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:50 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 739/1044. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 728/2268.12:30 ETDow -227.68 at 26250.34, Nasdaq -83.00 at 7873.3, S&P -31.08 at 2907.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 1.1% alongside the tech-sensitive Nasdaq.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96. WTI crude is down 1.1% to $52.15/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -45.50.The stock market is on track for a noticeably lower open, as new trade developments cast some doubt on this week's trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Differences between views on human rights appears to be the latest dispute between the countries. The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain.

As for trade talks, the South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese delegation could go home from the negotiations one day early as expectations are falling for any resolution to the trade dispute.In other matters, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that a Brexit deal is "overwhelmingly unlikely" if Northern Ireland doesn't stay in the customs union.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The trio now stand -0.82%, -0.84%, and -0.55%, respectively.Gold futures settled lost $0.50 (-0.0%) on Tuesday to $1,503.90/oz, giving up afternoon gains which were fueled in part by trade uncertainty, after the greenback surged to a near one-week high.The U.S. Dollar Index holds near a one-week high, +0.2%, at 99.17.13:30 ETDow -145.51 at 26332.51, Nasdaq -71.74 at 7884.56, S&P -24.73 at 2914.1[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are attempting to return to session highs in recent action with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosting the shallowest losses, down 0.55%.The worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.61, -1.16, -2.43%), Dow (DOW 44.34, -0.83, -1.84%), and IBM (IBM 139.01, -2.27, -1.61%) despite a dearth of corporate news.Conversely, big box retail giant Walmart (WMT 118.12, +0.89, +0.76%) sits atop the index.The DJIA gives back all of Friday's recovery, now -2.17% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.413% on a bid-to-cover of 2.43.12:55 ETDow -151.85 at 26326.17, Nasdaq -69.41 at 7886.89, S&P -24.70 at 2914.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages on Wall Street are down noticeably today after the U.S. placed 28 more Chinese organizations on its trade blacklist. The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:30 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.[Correction: a previous version of this comment indicated Fed Chair Powell would speak at 1:50 p.m. ET. This has been corrected to 1:30 p.m. ET]12:30 ETDow -227.68 at 26250.34, Nasdaq -83.00 at 7873.3, S&P -31.08 at 2907.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 1.1% alongside the tech-sensitive Nasdaq.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96. WTI crude is down 1.1% to $52.15/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -45.50.The stock market is on track for a noticeably lower open, as new trade developments cast some doubt on this week's trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Differences between views on human rights appears to be the latest dispute between the countries. The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain. The index rallied to begin the day but backed off its session high after the release of a weaker than expected Caixin Services PMI (actual 51.3; expected 52.1; last 52.1).

As for trade talks, the South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese delegation could go home from the negotiations one day early as expectations are falling for any resolution to the trade dispute.In other matters, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that a Brexit deal is "overwhelmingly unlikely" if Northern Ireland doesn't stay in the customs union.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The trio now stand -0.82%, -0.84%, and -0.55%, respectively.Gold futures settled lost $0.50 (-0.0%) on Tuesday to $1,503.90/oz, giving up afternoon gains which were fueled in part by trade uncertainty, after the greenback surged to a near one-week high.The U.S. Dollar Index holds near a one-week high, +0.2%, at 99.17.13:30 ETDow -145.51 at 26332.51, Nasdaq -71.74 at 7884.56, S&P -24.73 at 2914.1[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are attempting to return to session highs in recent action with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosting the shallowest losses, down 0.55%.The worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.61, -1.16, -2.43%), Dow (DOW 44.34, -0.83, -1.84%), and IBM (IBM 139.01, -2.27, -1.61%) despite a dearth of corporate news.Conversely, big box retail giant Walmart (WMT 118.12, +0.89, +0.76%) sits atop the index.The DJIA gives back all of Friday's recovery, now -2.17% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.413% on a bid-to-cover of 2.43.12:55 ETDow -151.85 at 26326.17, Nasdaq -69.41 at 7886.89, S&P -24.70 at 2914.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages on Wall Street are down noticeably today after the U.S. placed 28 more Chinese organizations on its trade blacklist. The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:50 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 739/1044. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 728/2268.12:30 ETDow -227.68 at 26250.34, Nasdaq -83.00 at 7873.3, S&P -31.08 at 2907.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 1.1% alongside the tech-sensitive Nasdaq.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96. WTI crude is down 1.1% to $52.15/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Differences between views on human rights appears to be the latest dispute between the countries. The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain. The index rallied to begin the day but backed off its session high after the release of a weaker than expected Caixin Services PMI (actual 51.3; expected 52.1; last 52.1).

As for trade talks, the South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese delegation could go home from the negotiations one day early as expectations are falling for any resolution to the trade dispute.In other matters, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that a Brexit deal is "overwhelmingly unlikely" if Northern Ireland doesn't stay in the customs union.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The trio now stand -0.82%, -0.84%, and -0.55%, respectively.Gold futures settled lost $0.50 (-0.0%) on Tuesday to $1,503.90/oz, giving up afternoon gains which were fueled in part by trade uncertainty, after the greenback surged to a near one-week high.The U.S. Dollar Index holds near a one-week high, +0.2%, at 99.17.13:30 ETDow -145.51 at 26332.51, Nasdaq -71.74 at 7884.56, S&P -24.73 at 2914.1[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are attempting to return to session highs in recent action with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosting the shallowest losses, down 0.55%.The worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.61, -1.16, -2.43%), Dow (DOW 44.34, -0.83, -1.84%), and IBM (IBM 139.01, -2.27, -1.61%) despite a dearth of corporate news.Conversely, big box retail giant Walmart (WMT 118.12, +0.89, +0.76%) sits atop the index.The DJIA gives back all of Friday's recovery, now -2.17% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.413% on a bid-to-cover of 2.43.12:55 ETDow -151.85 at 26326.17, Nasdaq -69.41 at 7886.89, S&P -24.70 at 2914.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages on Wall Street are down noticeably today after the U.S. placed 28 more Chinese organizations on its trade blacklist. The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:50 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 739/1044. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 728/2268.12:30 ETDow -227.68 at 26250.34, Nasdaq -83.00 at 7873.3, S&P -31.08 at 2907.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 1.1% alongside the tech-sensitive Nasdaq.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96. WTI crude is down 1.1% to $52.15/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -45.50.The stock market is on track for a noticeably lower open, as new trade developments cast some doubt on this week's trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Differences between views on human rights appears to be the latest dispute between the countries. The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain.

As for trade talks, the South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese delegation could go home from the negotiations one day early as expectations are falling for any resolution to the trade dispute.In other matters, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that a Brexit deal is "overwhelmingly unlikely" if Northern Ireland doesn't stay in the customs union.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The trio now stand -0.82%, -0.84%, and -0.55%, respectively.Gold futures settled lost $0.50 (-0.0%) on Tuesday to $1,503.90/oz, giving up afternoon gains which were fueled in part by trade uncertainty, after the greenback surged to a near one-week high.The U.S. Dollar Index holds near a one-week high, +0.2%, at 99.17.13:30 ETDow -145.51 at 26332.51, Nasdaq -71.74 at 7884.56, S&P -24.73 at 2914.1[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are attempting to return to session highs in recent action with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosting the shallowest losses, down 0.55%.The worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.61, -1.16, -2.43%), Dow (DOW 44.34, -0.83, -1.84%), and IBM (IBM 139.01, -2.27, -1.61%) despite a dearth of corporate news.Conversely, big box retail giant Walmart (WMT 118.12, +0.89, +0.76%) sits atop the index.The DJIA gives back all of Friday's recovery, now -2.17% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.413% on a bid-to-cover of 2.43.12:55 ETDow -151.85 at 26326.17, Nasdaq -69.41 at 7886.89, S&P -24.70 at 2914.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages on Wall Street are down noticeably today after the U.S. placed 28 more Chinese organizations on its trade blacklist. The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:30 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.[Correction: a previous version of this comment indicated Fed Chair Powell would speak at 1:50 p.m. ET. This has been corrected to 1:30 p.m. ET]12:30 ETDow -227.68 at 26250.34, Nasdaq -83.00 at 7873.3, S&P -31.08 at 2907.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 1.1% alongside the tech-sensitive Nasdaq.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96. WTI crude is down 1.1% to $52.15/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.6%, below fair value.Differences between views on human rights appears to be the latest dispute between the countries. The U.S. added 28 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist over China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On a related note, China suspended broadcast of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.China has signaled it might retaliate against the trade blacklist, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. Evidently, investors are feeling less optimistic about senior-level talks slated to begin on Thursday.The yield on the 10-yr note is down three basis points to 1.52%, little changed after the Producer Price Index for September unexpected declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).08:51 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -18.10.

China's Shanghai Composite (+0.3%) reopened after a weeklong closure, registering a slight gain.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97. WTI crude gave up an intraday gain to finish unchanged at $52.79/bbl.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for August:Consumer credit increased by $17.9 bln in August (Briefing.com consensus $13.3 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $23.0 bln (from $23.3 bln) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that nonrevolving credit accounted for the entire expansion in consumer credit in August. Nonrevolving credit decreased on the heels of an increase in July that had marked the fastest pace of expansion since November 2017.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +19.9% YTDS&P 500 +17.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +13.5% YTDRussell 2000 +11.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 952/1615. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1318/1751.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: October 8, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is down 0.9%, the Dow is down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.0%.Reviewing the S&P 500 sectors shows the real estate sector (+0.1%) as today's lone group in the green. The financials (-1.5%), materials (-1.1%), health care (-1.1%), and information technology (-1.1%) sectors are down over 1.0%.WTI crude settled down $0.13 (-0.3%) to $52.66/bbl.15:00 ETDow -80.04 at 26397.98, Nasdaq -44.50 at 7911.8, S&P -17.20 at 2921.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has pared losses and is now trading at session highs after Fed Chair Powell said the Fed "will soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time." The S&P 500 is down 0.5% after being down as much as 1.4%.In other words, the size of the balance sheet is expected to increase, but Mr. Powell said this "should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchases programs that we deployed after the financial crisis."At the same time, Fed Chair Powell's speech did not suggest that an October rate cut is not likely, keeping the market in good spirits about its high expectations for a 25-basis points cut. The fed-funds sensitive 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.44%, and the benchmark 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.55%.14:30 ETDow -154.47 at 26323.55, Nasdaq -74.32 at 7881.98, S&P -25.87 at 2912.96[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have drifted lower off their levels from half an hour ago, though still stand firmly within their daily range.Top decliners in the S&P 500 include Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 16.51, -2.16, -11.57%) -- after analysts at Goldman downgraded the stock to a "Sell" rating while also trimming their price target on the name to $16 from $54, Waters (WAT 209.69, -13.79, -6.17%) -- after med-tech peer Qiagen's (QGEN 25.33, -6.73, -20.99%) revenue warning, executive departure, and Boston Scientific (BSX 37.92, -2.43, -6.02%) -- also down in sympathy to QGEN's news.Conversely, airliner American Airlines (AAL 26.64, +0.81, +3.14%) sits atop the index.14:00 ETDow -146.46 at 26331.56, Nasdaq -67.04 at 7889.26, S&P -24.01 at 2914.82[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 cracked a session high, the Nasdaq Composite made an afternoon high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average mostly stayed put in the last half hour. The trio now stand -0.82%, -0.84%, and -0.55%, respectively.Gold futures settled lost $0.50 (-0.0%) on Tuesday to $1,503.90/oz, giving up afternoon gains which were fueled in part by trade uncertainty, after the greenback surged to a near one-week high.The U.S. Dollar Index holds near a one-week high, +0.2%, at 99.17.13:30 ETDow -145.51 at 26332.51, Nasdaq -71.74 at 7884.56, S&P -24.73 at 2914.1[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are attempting to return to session highs in recent action with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hosting the shallowest losses, down 0.55%.The worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today include Cisco Systems (CSCO 46.61, -1.16, -2.43%), Dow (DOW 44.34, -0.83, -1.84%), and IBM (IBM 139.01, -2.27, -1.61%) despite a dearth of corporate news.Conversely, big box retail giant Walmart (WMT 118.12, +0.89, +0.76%) sits atop the index.The DJIA gives back all of Friday's recovery, now -2.17% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.413% on a bid-to-cover of 2.43.12:55 ETDow -151.85 at 26326.17, Nasdaq -69.41 at 7886.89, S&P -24.70 at 2914.13[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages on Wall Street are down noticeably today after the U.S. placed 28 more Chinese organizations on its trade blacklist. The S&P 500 (-0.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.9%) are down nearly 1.0%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) fares slightly better. Each are currently off session lows.The U.S. Commerce Department cited human rights violations against a Muslim minority in China for its decision. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman denied any violations and hinted at possible retaliation. According to the Global Times, the spokesman added that "Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks [ahead of trade talks] and will deal with them calmly."Concerns have been rooted in a view that major progress in this week's trade talks is now less likely, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15. In turn, the stock market appears to be pricing in some disappointment, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors down between 0.3% (real estate) and 1.3% (health care).Unsurprisingly, the China-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) is down big, as many of its components derive a significant portion of their revenue from China. Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 52.28, -4.97, -8.7%) are down nearly 9% as one of its customers, Hikvision, was among the Chinese companies that now needs a license to conduct business in the U.S.Elsewhere, continued Brexit uncertainty and warnings from the IMF and World Bank about global economic conditions have also tempered risk sentiment. As a reminder, Fed Chair Powell will speak at an annual luncheon at 1:30 p.m. ET.An overnight advance in Treasuries has pulled back, even after producer prices unexpectedly declined in September. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.14.Separately, Domino's Pizza (DPZ 254.61, +12.30, +5.1%) has brushed off early weakness and is now firmly in positive territory. The company missed earnings estimates and tempered its long-term outlook, but it also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for September and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3% m/m in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%), as did the index for final demand less food and energy (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the price declines were broad based, and not just energy-related, which is indicative of an environment characterized by weaker demand. The Producer Price Index for September wasn't good news, unless it's spun as a "bad news is good news" kind of thing because it seemingly strengthened the case for a Fed rate cut later this month.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September declined to 101.8 from 103.1.[Correction: a previous version of this comment indicated Fed Chair Powell would speak at 1:50 p.m. ET. This has been corrected to 1:30 p.m. ET]12:30 ETDow -227.68 at 26250.34, Nasdaq -83.00 at 7873.3, S&P -31.08 at 2907.75[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 1.1% alongside the tech-sensitive Nasdaq.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Alphabet (GOOG 1196.37, -11.39, -0.9%) and Amazon (AMZN 1719.91, -12.75, -0.7%) are down noticeably, while Facebook (FB 178.91, -0.77, -0.5%) and Apple (AAPL 226.13, -0.91, -0.4%) are down modestly. Netflix (NFLX 274.84, +0.38) is up 0.2%.On a related note, Facebook announced it will expand its Workplace business service to include a Portal video chat. Shares of Zoom Video (ZM 73.76, -3.29) are down 4.3%.11:55 ETDow -289.06 at 26188.96, Nasdaq -99.13 at 7857.17, S&P -36.73 at 2902.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to struggle deep in negative territory with a 1.3% decline. Unsurprisingly, the cyclical sectors are among today's worst-performing groups amid growth concerns, but so is the health care sector (-1.7%).It could be speculated that its underperformance today is not only a function of the broad-based decline today, but also the pestering idea that there is bipartisan support for efforts aimed at curbing healthcare costs. Shares of Thermo Fisher (TMO 272.78, -16.34, -5.7%) are down nearly 6%.Overseas, the major European indices closed firmly lower. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.8%, and France's CAC lost 1.2%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.0%.11:25 ETDow -275.88 at 26202.14, Nasdaq -91.30 at 7865, S&P -34.42 at 2904.41[BRIEFING.COM] The market briefly ticked higher earlier following a hopeful-sounding report from China's Global Times. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%.The newspaper said that the size and composition of the delegation traveling to Washington "signaled that China is sincerely looking to reach a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S." Regarding the blacklisting of its firms, China's foreign ministry spokesman said, "It adds to the uncertainty, but Beijing has become accustomed to such tricks and will deal with them calmly."Like yesterday, then, market participants will have to wait for those talks to begin on Thursday for a definitive answer on what happens next, especially with the tariff-rate increase planned for Oct. 15. In the meantime, the market continues to price-in some disappointment.10:55 ETDow -298.50 at 26179.52, Nasdaq -103.10 at 7853.2, S&P -37.29 at 2901.54[BRIEFING.COM] The major average remain deep in the red near session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.3%, the Dow is down 1.2%, and the Nasdaq is down 1.3%.There is a lack of buying conviction, evidenced by the broad-based losses in the S&P 500 sectors that are down between 0.7% (consumer staples) and 1.9% (financials). The CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.7 points, or 9.7%, to 19.60, reflecting an increased interest to hedge against further downside.Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ 246.58, +4.40, +1.8%), on the other hand, have turned it around and now trade higher by 2.1%. Shares were initially down big after the company missed earnings estimates, reported slower growth in domestic same store sales, and tempered its long-term outlook. The company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.10:30 ETDow -275.61 at 26202.41, Nasdaq -98.96 at 7857.34, S&P -35.50 at 2903.33[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.2%. Yesterday included plenty of trade speculation, but today's trade angst has been based on more substantive news.Specifically, the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for violating human rights against a Muslim minority in China. Beijing indicated it could retaliate, and it could reportedly leave trade talks one day early. A separate report from Bloomberg noted that the White House is considering limiting Chinese stocks in government pension plans.That is the news. Today's selling is then rooted in concerns that this week's trade talks will produce little progress, suggesting that the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports will still increase to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.On a related note, China suspended broadcasting of games for the Houston Rockets after its general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong over the weekend.09:55 ETDow -255.54 at 26222.48, Nasdaq -92.17 at 7864.13, S&P -32.88 at 2905.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 also trades lower by 1.1%.The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 2.3% in the early going, as many of its components derive a sizable portion of their revenue from China. The 28 newest Chinese firms blacklisted in the U.S. must be approved a license to conduct business with U.S. companies.Shares of Ambarella (AMBA 51.49, -5.80, -10.0%) have given back 10% after the company's Chinese customer, Hikvision, was among the companies blacklisted. Ambarella is not a part of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.09:40 ETDow -254.56 at 26223.46, Nasdaq -81.71 at 7874.59, S&P -30.78 at 2908.05[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have dropped at the open after the U.S. added 28 more Chinese firms to a trade blacklist ahead of trade talks. The S&P 500 is down 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows all 11 sectors trading in negative territory. Financials (-1.4%) and industrials (-1.3%) lead the retreat with losses over 1.0%, while real estate (-0.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) hold modest losses.U.S. Treasuries are up, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.43%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.52%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.96.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%), and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) also finished with modest losses.Ostensibly, the stock market opened lower following a Bloomberg report that suggested China was not interested in a complete trade deal at this time, then rallied into positive territory after NEC Director Larry Kudlow said comments out of Beijing have been more positive. Throw in some conflicting tweets from a Fox Business reporter, and it was enough to inject more gyrations and confusion into the market.It would be remiss, however, to explain today's price action solely on these headlines. There might have been a lack of conviction after a strong ending to last week, with technical factors lingering in the background. The S&P 500 closed a hair below its 50-day moving average (2941). As for trade, the market will likely have to wait for senior-level talks on Thursday and Friday for more clarity.In turn, ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished lower amid relatively light trading volume. The energy sector (-0.9%) was today's laggard, while the communication services sector (+0.04%) finished fractionally higher.In corporate news, Silicon Motion (SIMO 38.30, +2.45, +6.8%) raised its Q3 revenue guidance, signaling that healthy demand for Apple's (AAPL 227.06, +0.05, unch) iPhone 11 is funneling through the supply chain. Silicon Motion was one of the few gainers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%).Elsewhere, PG&E (PCG 11.50, +0.63, +5.8%) outperformed following a report that indicated wildfire claims will be capped at $13.5 billion. Uber (UBER 30.37, +0.70, +2.4%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on improving risk vs reward. Labor talks between General Motors (GM 34.75, -0.16, -0.5%) and the UAW were said to have taken a "turn for the worse" over the weekend.U.S. Treasuries finished firmly lower, driving yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.46%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.55%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.97.

Disturbing video shows hundreds of blindfolded prisoners in XinjiangCNN.comSeptember 23, 2019 Monday 10:21 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 1277 wordsByline: By Matt Rivers, Max Foster and James Griffiths, CNNBodyA drone video appearing to show hundreds of blindfolded men being led from a train in China has raised new concerns over the ongoing crackdown on Muslim Uyghurs in the far western region of Xinjiang.The video -- which was posted online anonymously last week -- shows hundreds of men, most of whom are dressed in purple and orange vests with the words "Kashgar Detention Center" printed on them, seated in rows on the ground of what appears to be a large courtyard outside a train station. Their heads are shaved and their hands bound behind their backs. All of the men are wearing black blindfolds over their eyes and they are being watched over by dozens of police officers in SWAT uniforms.CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of this video or the date it was shot. Chinese Foreign Ministry officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the video.In a statement to CNN on October 4, authorities in Xinjiang said that "cracking down on crimes in accordance with law is the common practice of all countries.""Xinjiang's crackdown on crimes has never been linked to ethnicities or religions," the statement added. "Transporting inmates by judicial authorities (is related) to normal judicial activities."Prisoners in China are regularly transported wearing blindfolds. It is unclear whether the men are being held for criminal offenses or for other reasons. The YouTube account which uploaded the video described it as demonstrating the "long-term suppression of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Chinese government in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region."For the last two-and-a-half years, China has been detaining hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in what Beijing alternately describes as "voluntary de-radicalization camps" and "vocational training centers." Former detainees have described them as closer to internment camps, however, and allegations of abuse are rampant, including in firsthand accounts given to CNN describing torture and forced political re-education under the threat of violence.Evidence points to XinjiangA western intelligence official told CNN they believed the video was authentic."China needs to be challenged for this behavior," the official said. "So many countries support China on human rights without understanding that it appears to be attempting to wipe out the entire Uyghur identity."The official was able to verify the movement of some 500 prisoners earlier this year from Kashgar to Korla, information that broadly lined up with a separate analysis of the video by researcher Nathan Ruser, a China expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Ruser however suggests that the video was filmed in August 2018.Ruser said that information in the video itself -- including data from the drone camera and visible landmarks that could be compared to open source satellite photos -- indicated that it had been recorded in Kuresi Station, near the city of Korla in central Xinjiang.He added that the men in the video appeared to be being transported from a detention center in Kashgar "to the much more expansive Korla facilities."A US official also told reporters on September 24 that Washington believes the video to be authentic. "Let's not talk about the validity of any particular evidence. It's the summary evidence, it's the bulk of evidence," State Department official David Stilwell said.Chinese officials have not yet responded to the video. On September 23, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying slammed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who had said that China was attempting to "erase its own citizens" in Xinjiang and called on countries around the world to "resist China's demands to repatriate" Uyghurs.Hua called Pompeo's statement "utterly defamatory and groundless," adding that Beijing urged relevant US officials to face the facts, be objective and fair, and not adopt double standards on counter-terrorism, let alone to use this as an excuse to launch unwarranted attacks against China," referring to Beijing's claims that activities in Xinjiang are about stemming a terrorist threat in the region.While the US and several of its allies have been outspoken in condemning China's actions in Xinjiang, many nations in the Muslim world who do business with China have been more cautious in their statements. In July, nearly half the signatories of a letter defending Beijing's policies in the region were Muslim-majority nations, including Pakistan, Qatar, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.'That used to be me'For two former detainees in Xinjiang, the video was strikingly familiar.Amanzhan Seiit, a Muslim ethnic Kazakh, said he was detained in China in 2018, but was never told what for. After several weeks in one camp, he said he was moved to another in a fashion exactly the same as shown in the video."We were made to sit just like that," he told CNN. "They put cuffs on our hands and legs and masks over our heads. Lots of police were there with guns."He was released after several months and now lives in Kazakhstan, a country on China's western border. While detained, he says the fear of not knowing what might happen was the worst."Watching the video, I'm still scared because I know what the prisoners are thinking," Seiit said. "They don't know where they're being taken or if they'll be shot dead. It's terrifying."There are no publicly known instances of shooting deaths inside the camps. More than 3,000 miles away, Omerbek Bikali, another Muslim Kazakh, knows how it feels to be scared in custody.He lives in the Netherlands now, after being detained in a Chinese camp for months in 2017. He claims he was tortured regularly and describes the camps as hell."I think the reason they want to torture us is, firstly, to make us physically weak so that you cannot resist," he said.Bikali said though he was transferred between camps by car, he too had a bag placed over his head and his hands shackled. Watching the drone video, he was overcome with emotion."I feel so sad. That used to be me. I cannot forget that. It's criminal," he said.Xinjiang authorities and Chinese Foreign Ministry officials did not respond to requests for comment about the former detainees' allegations.Restricted regionBeijing has had a long and fractious history with Xinjiang, a massive, nominally autonomous region in the far west of the country that is home to approximately 22 million of the about 1.4 billion people living in China.The predominantly Muslim Uyghurs are ethnically distinct from the country's majority ethnic group, the Han Chinese. The Uyghurs form the majority in Xinjiang, where they account for just under half of the total population. Some Uyghurs claim the camps are part of a "cultural genocide" by Beijing, to eliminate the Uyghurs' religion and culture and bring them closer to China's majority Han population.Speaking to reporters in July, Shohrat Zakir, Xinjiang's governor and the region's highest-ranking ethnic Uyghur official, said that most detainees have been released, adding that the camps have been "hugely positive" for the region.He declined to answer a question as to how many people remained in the camps.Zakir said the camps had taught Uyghurs to practice their religion "normally" but added no single religion or minority group had been targeted."If there still skeptics, whether they are journalists, officials or religious figures, we welcome them to visit anywhere in Xinjiang or go to any vocational training center of their choice -- anytime," he said.Previous attempts by CNN to visit the internment camps have been repeatedly blocked by local authorities.Load-Date: October 7, 2019End of Document

S&P: -2.22...NYSE Vol: 193.6 mln.. Adv: 1624.. Dec: 1154Nasdaq Vol: 670.6 mln.. Adv: 1567.. Dec: 1345Moving the MarketSector Watch-- Stock market trades little changed after yesterday's earnings-driven rally; relative weakness in software stocks-- Retail sales unexpectedly decline in September; uncertainty about Brexit, U.S.-China deals-- Bank earnings come in better than expectedStrong: Materials, Consumer Discretionary, FinancialsWeak: Information Technology, Real Estate11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18. WTI crude is up 0.2% to $52.93/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -3.60. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -19.40.The S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.2%, below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended the midweek session on a mixed note. The People's Bank of China injected CNY200 bln of liquidity but left the medium-term lending facility rate unchanged at 3.3%. The Chinese government warned that "strong countermeasures" will be taken if the U.S. passes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The act was passed by the House last evening and it is expected to also clear the Senate. Bank of Korea lowered its repurchase rate by 25 bps to 1.25%, as expected. The central bank signaled that GDP and CPI forecasts will be cut once the market receives data for Q3.In economic data: South Korea's September Unemployment Rate 3.4% (expected 3.9%; last 3.1%). September Import Price Index -2.2% yr/yr (expected -0.3%; last -0.2%) and Export Price Index -5.0% yr/yr (expected -1.0%; last -4.0%) New Zealand's Q3 CPI +0.7% qtr/qtr (expected 0.6%; last 0.6%); +1.5% yr/yr (expected 1.4%; last 1.7%)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +1.2% Hong Kong's Hang Seng: +0.6% China's Shanghai Composite: -0.4% India's Sensex: +0.2% South Korea's Kospi: +0.7% Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +1.2%Major European indices trade near their flat lines. There is still some uncertainty regarding the viability of the modified Brexit deal. EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to provide a briefing to EU ambassadors around 10:00 ET.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher.

Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18. WTI crude is up 0.2% to $52.93/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -3.60. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -19.40.The S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.2%, below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended the midweek session on a mixed note. The People's Bank of China injected CNY200 bln of liquidity but left the medium-term lending facility rate unchanged at 3.3%. The Chinese government warned that "strong countermeasures" will be taken if the U.S. passes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The act was passed by the House last evening and it is expected to also clear the Senate. Bank of Korea lowered its repurchase rate by 25 bps to 1.25%, as expected.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation.

The deal is tentative (specifics not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 98.18. WTI crude is up 0.2% to $52.93/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -3.60. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -19.40.The S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.2%, below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended the midweek session on a mixed note. The People's Bank of China injected CNY200 bln of liquidity but left the medium-term lending facility rate unchanged at 3.3%. The Chinese government warned that "strong countermeasures" will be taken if the U.S. passes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The act was passed by the House last evening and it is expected to also clear the Senate. Bank of Korea lowered its repurchase rate by 25 bps to 1.25%, as expected. The central bank signaled that GDP and CPI forecasts will be cut once the market receives data for Q3.In economic data: South Korea's September Unemployment Rate 3.4% (expected 3.9%; last 3.1%).

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -15.30.The S&P 500 futures trade two points, or 0.1%, below fair value after yesterday's earnings-relief rally. Today, investors continue to assess incoming earnings reports, U.S.-China trade relations, and an elusive Brexit deal.Bank of America (BAC 30.37, +0.64, +2.2%) headlines today's batch of bank earnings, and results have come in better than expected. United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The House of Representative passed the bill, but it remains uncertain when the Senate would vote. Elsewhere, some uncertainty remains on a modified Brexit deal despite reports yesterday indicating a draft deal was near.On the data front, investors will receive Retail Sales for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 8:30 a.m. ET, Business Inventories for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) at 10:00 a.m. ET, the Fed's Beige Book for October at 2:00 p.m. ET, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for August at 4:00 p.m. ET.

The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.34.

The deal is tentative (specifics not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE declined 0.6%, and France's CAC declined 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday. The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%.Earnings season began in earnest yesterday, and results have come in mostly better than expected today. Bank of America (BAC 30.33, +0.60, +2.0%), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 114.96, +3.36, +3.0%), and United Airlines (UAL 89.54, +1.64, +1.9%) are some notable earnings gainers. JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). The July reading was revised to 0.3% (from 0.4%).Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.09:40 ETDow -15.78 at 27009.02, Nasdaq -24.99 at 8123.72, S&P -4.35 at 2991.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day slightly lower, retracing some of yesterday's earnings-driven rally. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology sector (-0.8%) exerting an influential drag on the broader market. The materials (+0.2%), consumer discretionary (+0.2%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors hold slim gains.U.S. Treasuries are up slightly, which has yields slightly lower today.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -17.30.Wall Street is indicated to open slightly lower as the S&P 500 futures trade four points, or 0.1%, below fair value. Earnings news has been upbeat, although some macro news is presumably keeping the market in check after yesterday's rally.Earnings results have come in mostly better than expected today, with shares of Bank of America (BAC 30.38, +0.65, +2.2%) and United Airlines (UAL 89.60, +1.72, +2.0%) up 2% in pre-market action following their results.As for macro news, there has been some renewed uncertainty about a Brexit deal and some angst about China threatening countermeasures against the U.S. if the Senate passes a bill that supports protesters in Hong Hong. The latter is viewed as a complication in getting the first part of a trade deal written out.Reaction to the release of the retail sales report for September, which unexpectedly declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), has been relatively muted. The reading followed an upwards revision of 0.6% in August (from 0.4%). The 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.74%.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.40.

The People's Bank of China injected CNY200 bln of liquidity but left the medium-term lending facility rate unchanged at 3.3%. The Chinese government warned that "strong countermeasures" will be taken if the U.S. passes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The act was passed by the House last evening and it is expected to also clear the Senate. Bank of Korea lowered its repurchase rate by 25 bps to 1.25%, as expected.

Today, investors continue to assess incoming earnings reports, U.S.-China trade relations, and an elusive Brexit deal.Bank of America (BAC 30.37, +0.64, +2.2%) headlines today's batch of bank earnings, and results have come in better than expected. United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors.

"People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31.

United Airlines (UAL 89.10, +1.22, +1.4%) also topped earnings estimates and raised its FY19 EPS guidance. Overall, results have been better than feared, but political uncertainty has tempered sentiment.For instance, China warned it would take "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. if it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon. Although nothing was finalized, the optimism helped solidify a risk-on mindset following today's batch of better-than-feared earnings results.The benchmark index traded around the 3000 level for most of the session, supported by gains in nine of its 11 sectors. The health care sector (+1.8%) provided the leadership, followed by the communication services (+1.6%) and financials (+1.3%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.3%) sectors ended the day lower.Wells Fargo (WFC 50.07, +0.80, +1.6%), Citigroup (C 71.23, +0.99, +1.4%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 206.41, +0.59, +0.3%) each began the day in negative territory after the banks provided mixed results, but a turnaround in shares provided extra support for the early move higher.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.2%) set a new all-time high on Tuesday. 29 of its 30 components finished higher, with NVIDIA (NVDA 196.37, +9.84, +5.3%) advancing the most after its price target was raised to $250 from $225 at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Trade news continued to make headlines, although the muted reaction likely reflected some exhaustion to trade speculation. "People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher.

Facebook (FB 188.88, -0.01, unch) is little changed.On a related note, Netflix will report its earnings report after today's closing bell. The stock is up nearly 11% since its close on Sept. 24.11:55 ETDow +22.81 at 27047.61, Nasdaq -15.99 at 8132.72, S&P -0.70 at 2994.98[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains little changed amid a general lack of conviction among buyers and sellers.In recent news, General Motors (GM 37.14, +0.88, +2.4%) and the UAW have agreed to a potential labor contract that could end the monthlong strike. The deal is tentative (details not specified) and is subject to approval tomorrow.Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed.

The Europe Stoxx 600 lost 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -10.30 at 27014.5, Nasdaq -18.49 at 8130.22, S&P -2.22 at 2993.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 remains trading just below its unchanged mark with a 0.1% loss. Some uncertainty on the Brexit and U.S.-China trade fronts has some investors feeling less optimistic today.Specifically, there have been reports that a Brexit agreement by Oct. 31 continues to see some hurdles, while China has threatened "strong countermeasures" against the U.S. should the Senate pass a legislation that supports protesters in Hong Kong. The House passed the bill yesterday, which prompted the response that could complicate a trade deal with China.In the health care space, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Corporation (MCK 146.53, +8.36, +6.0%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.75, +1.86, +3.9%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 87.14, +3.94, +4.7%) are in talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, which would be phased over 18 years.10:55 ETDow -17.81 at 27006.99, Nasdaq -13.04 at 8135.67, S&P -0.66 at 2995.02[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade just below their flat lines after increasing about 1% apiece yesterday.

JBHT did miss earnings estimates, though.Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) recently said he doesn't think more rate cuts are needed this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Evans' comments have been met with muted reaction, as the market still expects a 25-basis points rate cut at the October FOMC meeting.10:25 ETDow -30.96 at 26993.84, Nasdaq -20.26 at 8128.45, S&P -3.12 at 2992.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold a modest 0.2% decline. Macro news and retail sales data have been attributed to today's negative bias, but today could simply be a breather from a recent stretch of gains. Entering today, the benchmark index was up 4.9% from its low on Oct. 3.Noticeable weakness in the software stocks after an uninspiring analyst day for Workday (WDAY 160.50, -20.52, -11.3%) has had a more noticeable effect on the market. Morgan Stanley also cut its price target on several software stocks, including VMware (VMW 152.22, -2.32, -1.5%).The S&P 500 information technology sector is down 0.8% and is today's laggard.10:00 ETDow -60.37 at 26964.43, Nasdaq -37.71 at 8111, S&P -8.13 at 2987.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.1%.Just in, business inventories were unchanged for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%).

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon.

"People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher.

No Headline In OriginalCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 1, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 573 wordsBodyWashington, Sep 1 (EFEUSA).- The United States has complied with its promised tariff increase on Chinese imports and has now applied a 15% levy, five percentage points more than it had originally announced, to Chinese imports worth $112 billion.The measure entered into force at 00.01 local (04.01 GMT) this Sunday, September 1, according to the Office of the Representative of Foreign Trade of the United States.These tariffs affect Chinese goods such as clothing, footwear and school supplies, but also foods such as condensed milk, cheeses, vegetables and fruit, or gadgets such as sewing machines, as detailed in the 122-page list published by the authorities American.On August 24, President Donald Trump announced that he would raise tariffs on a substantial portion of Chinese imports on September 1, 10%, and 15%, in retaliation for US property levies imposed by Beijing.The representative reported that day of two tariff hikes he had previously announced: "As of October 1, the $250 billion of goods and products from China that are currently (at the time) taxed at 25%, will be taxed 30 percent," Trump said.In addition, it anticipated that as of September 1, some of the package ($112 billion) of Chinese imports worth $300 billion was to be taxed at 10% would be taxed at 15%.By December 15, the same increase is expected to apply to the rest of those $300 billion of Chinese goods, which would be about $160 billion, and will impact on products such as mobile phones, laptops, video game consoles and certain toys.With this conflict, Trump has set a goal of balancing trade between the two countries, broadly favorable to China, but so far and despite the imposition of tariffs, it has had little or no results.Researcher Chad Bown, of the Peterson Institute School of Studies, noted in a recent report that "the purpose and the next step in Trump's trade war remain unknown."The expert noted that with Sunday's rise in tariffs, the percentage of Chinese imports to the US affected by tariffs is 68.5% and will reach 96.8% on December 15.According to Bown, if the scheduled tariff increases run their course, "virtually all imports of China into all sectors will be fully covered (by tariffs) by 15 December."Washington imposed the measures that came into force today after the Chinese government complied with its threats and announced in mid-August the imposition of tariffs on US property worth $75 billion, in response also to other levies previous Americans.Still, China's state-owned television CGTN today said negotiating teams from both powers plan to meet earlier this month in the US to try to reach an agreement that satisfies both sides.In this regard, China's Ministry of Commerce lamented that Washington's new round of levies is not the best environment for trade negotiations.Chinese Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Asian country's negotiating delegation, Liu He, said this week that he was "firmly opposed to an upsurge in trade war" and that he prefers"quiet negotiations".Trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, unleashed after Trump's arrival in the White House in 2017, go beyond bilateral relations and have profound global consequences.In its latest global growth forecasts, released in July, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its global expansion projections to 3.2% this year, one-tenth less than in April because of doubts about the possible resolution of this dispute.Load-Date: September 3, 2019End of Document

The new location will be announced soon."Chile's government on Wednesday canceled the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation summit set for Nov. 16-17 due to continuing anti-government protests.
