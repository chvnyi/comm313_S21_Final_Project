Survey: China factory activity sinks to 3-year lowAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 28, 2019 Thursday 6:19 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 436 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Chinese manufacturing activity fell to a three-year low in February amid a tariff battle with Washington and weak global demand, a survey showed Thursday.The monthly purchasing managers' index by the government statistics bureau and an industry group fell 0.3 points to 49.2 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 indicate activity contracting. That was the lowest level since February 2016.Chinese manufacturers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's punitive tariffs in a fight over Beijing's technology plans and cooling consumer demand at home and abroad.Trump said weekend talks in Washington made progress but his chief negotiator, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, indicated Wednesday there are significant differences between the two sides."Much still needs to be done," Lighthizer said during an appearance before a U.S. House of Representatives panel. He mentioned Washington's desire for an enforcement mechanism with penalties if Beijing fails to carry out its commitments but gave no other details.Companies are wary of making investments and other long-term decisions without a formal settlement, economists say."Unless the trade war truly turns into an extended truce, the weakening trend may not end quickly," Irene Pang of ING said in a report.Any U.S.-Chinese deal is unlikely until at least the end of March, so "another month or two of bad PMI data" are likely, Pang said.Measures of output and employment declined, according to the National Bureau of Statistics and the Federation of Logistics & Purchasing.The weakness in trade and manufacturing has increased pressure on the ruling Communist Party to resolve its fight with Washington.Last year's economic growth declined to a three-decade low of 6.6 percent and Thursday's report adds to signs activity might be weakening further.Trump is pressing Beijing to roll back plans for state-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technology that Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say violate China's market-opening obligations.China's global exports rebounded in January from a contraction but sales to the United States fell 2.4 percent from a year earlier, reflecting the impact of Trump's tariff hikes.The trade battle has rattled Chinese consumers, some of whom say they are putting off big purchases until the economic outlook is clearer. That sets back Beijing's campaign to nurture self-sustaining economic growth based on domestic consumption instead of exports and investment.The government has warned Chinese exporters the global environment is "complicated and severe."Load-Date: March 1, 2019End of Document

Huawei fires sales manager who Poland charged with spyingAssociated Press Financial WireJanuary 12, 2019 Saturday 4:33 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 831 wordsByline: By VANESSA GERA and KELVIN CHAN, Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - The Chinese tech company Huawei on Saturday announced it has fired a sales director who was arrested in Poland and charged with spying for China, saying he has brought the firm's reputation "into disrepute."The company said it has "decided to terminate the employment of Mr. Wang Weijing, who was arrested on suspicion of breaking Polish law."Polish authorities said Friday they have arrested Wang, a Chinese citizen and former diplomat, along with a Polish cybersecurity expert who had held several top government cybersecurity jobs and also worked at the telecom company Orange.Huawei said Wang's actions "have no relation to the company" and that he was fired because "the incident in question has brought Huawei into disrepute."The arrest rekindled tensions between China and the West over cybersecurity concerns surrounding Huawei. It's the world's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment but has been banned in the U.S. since 2012 over fears it's a security risk.Earlier this week, Polish security agents searched the Warsaw offices of Huawei and Orange, Poland's leading communications provider, seizing documents and electronic data. The homes of both men, also in Warsaw, were also searched, according to Internal Security Agency spokesman Stanislaw Zaryn.Huawei had ambitious plans in Europe to roll out next-generation "5G" mobile networks. But some European governments and telecom companies are following the U.S. lead in questioning whether using Huawei for vital infrastructure for mobile networks could leave them exposed to snooping by the Chinese government."One thing is clear: this is another nail in the coffin of Huawei's European ambitions," said Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank.Poland is Huawei's headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe and the Nordic region.Maciej Wasik, deputy head of Poland's Special Services agency, said the operation that resulted in the arrests had been underway for a long time. He said "both carried out espionage activities against Poland."Zaryn told The Associated Press that prosecutors have charged the two men with espionage, but agents are continuing to collect evidence and interview witnesses. Further indictments are expected, he said.Polish state television TVP reported that the men have proclaimed their innocence, but Zaryn could not confirm that. If convicted, they could face up to 10 years in prison each.TVP identified the arrested Chinese man as Weijing W., saying he was a sales director in Poland at Huawei. It said he also went by the Polish first name of Stanislaw and had previously worked at the Chinese consulate in Gdansk.A LinkedIn profile for a man named Stanislaw Wang appears to match details described by Polish television.Wang's resume said he worked at China's General Consulate in Gdansk from 2006-2011 and at Huawei Enterprise Poland since 2011, where he was first director of public affairs and since 2017 the "sales director of public sector." The resume said he received a bachelor's degree in 2004 from the Beijing University of Foreign Studies.State TV identified the Polish man as Piotr D., and said he was a high-ranking employee at the Internal Security Agency, where he served as deputy director in the department of information security, until 2011.The Polish state news agency, PAP, said the man had also held top cybersecurity positions at the Interior Ministry and the Office of Electronic Communications, a regulatory body. It said, while at the Internal Security Agency, he was involved in building a mobile communications system for top Polish officials, and he was fired in 2011 amid a corruption scandal.Geopolitical tensions over Huawei have intensified since Canada arrested a top executive last month at the request of U.S. authorities. Last year Australia, New Zealand and Japan instituted their own bans against using Huawei.An official at the Chinese Embassy in Warsaw said Chinese envoys had urged Polish Foreign Ministry officials to arrange a consular visit with Wang "as soon as possible."Orange Poland told the AP on Friday it was cooperating with Polish security services in the case and had "handed over belongings of one of our employees" in Tuesday's search of its offices. Orange told the AP it did not know if the suspicions against its employee were related to his work at Orange or his previous jobs.Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested Dec. 1 in Canada in connection with U.S. accusations that the company violated restrictions on sales of American technology to Iran.The United States wants Meng extradited to face charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. She is out on bail in Canada awaiting extradition proceedings.On Dec. 10, China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on vague national security allegations in apparent retaliation for Meng's arrest.___Gera reported from Warsaw.Load-Date: January 13, 2019End of Document

US warns Germany that using Huawei tech will come at a costCNN WireMarch 12, 2019 Tuesday 2:41 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 987 wordsByline: By Kylie Atwood and Nicole Gaouette, CNNDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  The US has underscored to Germany its threat to limit intelligence sharing with countries that use Chinese tech giant Huawei to build their 5G communications networks. US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell sent a letter to the German government last week threatening to curtail German access to US intelligence if Berlin decides to issue contracts to Huawei, according to a US official familiar with the matter. "The Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy has indeed received a letter; there is no comment on its content from their side. There will be a quick reply," said Matthias Wehler, spokesperson at the German embassy in DC. Germany announced March 7 that it wouldn't ban any company from bidding on 5G contracts.The letter, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, echoes a steady drumbeat of warnings by top US officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, who flagged Huawei's alleged connections to Chinese intelligence and its ability to compromise national security by selling equipment with "backdoors" that could allow for unauthorized surveillance. A potent irritantCNN reported Monday that even as major US wireless carriers and the federal government shun Huawei over national security concerns, its technology is widely deployed by a number of small, federally-subsidized carriers that buy cheaper Chinese-made hardware to place atop their cell towers -- in some cases providing exclusive coverage to rural areas close to US military bases.As the US lobbies against Huawei, now the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, the issue is straining US ties with some allies and is becoming a potent irritant in a US-China relationship already strained by trade friction.China and Huawei have vigorously pushed back on the US charges and the telecom giant has filed suit against the US over the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which bans US federal agencies from buying Huawei products. The 5G network is the next generation of wireless networks that promises to be 100 times faster and more reliable than current technology. It is a market that will be worth billions, as 5G will require compatible new phones and communications equipment.Analysts and industry executives say Huawei has already built up such a strong lead in 5G technology that it's practically irreplaceable for many wireless carriers. And mobile operators around the world have said the US campaign is complicating their efforts to upgrade their networks.Germany's March 7 announcement that it will not bar any companies from bidding to build the country's 5G networks follows a similar decision by the United Kingdom. Both countries argue they can mitigate any risks and their decisions could make it harder for Washington to convince smaller countries to follow suit. The State Department has not replied to request for comment about Grenell's letter, but a National Security Council spokesperson outlined how Huawei's 5G networks could pose a constantly evolving and shifting threat."Because 5G networks are largely software-defined, updates pushed to the network by the manufacturer can radically change how they operate," Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, told CNN. "The 5G networks our allies buy won't be the networks that they eventually operate, as the software could be changed on a moment-to-moment basis by the manufacturer."'Every place I go'The public US pressure campaign on allies to reject Huawei follows the Trump administration's request for Canada to arrest Huawei's deputy chairwoman Meng Wangzhou for Iran sanctions violations. The US has pushed for a ban on Huawei technology with the UK, Australia, Poland, the European Union, the Philippines and a slew of other countries. Security concerns have led Australia to completely ban the company's technology and New Zealand has moved to partially restrict it.In February, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the costs of adopting Huawei technology explicit to European colleagues. Speaking in Hungary, the top US diplomat said that if allies choose Huawei equipment and it "is co-located where we have important American systems, it makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them."In March, he fleshed that out, telling students in Iowa that "every place that I go" he encounters "countries that are considering putting Huawei technology into their government infrastructure."Noting that the company is state-owned and has "deep connections" to intelligence services -- its founder was an engineer with the People's Liberation Army -- Pompeo said there's a real risk "that the Chinese will use this for purposes that aren't commercial, that aren't for private gain, but rather for the state's benefit. And it's a risk I think these countries ought to very, very carefully consider before they move forward."Earlier this year the German government discussed the need to ensure security if Huawei was used. Chancellor Angela Merkel said they were trying to make sure that the company would not hand over all of its information to the Chinese government."We need to talk to China to ensure that companies do not simply give up all data that is used to the Chinese state," Merkel said. She added that "safeguards" were needed to protect data.Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, struck a defiant tone in the face of US attempts to curb his company's international reach and prosecute his daughter. "There's no way the US can crush us," Ren said in a BBC interview that aired Tuesday. "The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced."CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect that Huawei has filed a lawsuit against the US over the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.CNN's Ben Westcott, Sherisse Pham, Alex Marquardt and Atika Shubert contributed to this reportTM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Security concerns have led Australia to completely ban the company's technology and New Zealand has moved to partially restrict it.In February, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the costs of adopting Huawei technology explicit to European colleagues.Speaking in Hungary, the top US diplomat said that if allies choose Huawei equipment and it "is co-located where we have important American systems, it makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them."In March, he fleshed that out, telling students in Iowa that "every place that I go" he encounters "countries that are considering putting Huawei technology into their government infrastructure."Noting that the company is state-owned and has "deep connections" to intelligence services -- its founder was an engineer with the People's Liberation Army -- Pompeo said there's a real risk "that the Chinese will use this for purposes that aren't commercial, that aren't for private gain, but rather for the state's benefit. And it's a risk I think these countries ought to very, very carefully consider before they move forward."Earlier this year the German government discussed the need to ensure security if Huawei was used. Chancellor Angela Merkel said they were trying to make sure that the company would not hand over all of its information to the Chinese government."We need to talk to China to ensure that companies do not simply give up all data that is used to the Chinese state," Merkel said. She added that "safeguards" were needed to protect data.Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, struck a defiant tone in the face of US attempts to curb his company's international reach and prosecute his daughter. "There's no way the US can crush us," Ren said in a BBC interview that aired Tuesday. "The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced."CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect that Huawei has filed a lawsuit against the US over the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.Load-Date: March 12, 2019End of Document

THE LOWY INSTITUTE INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT Q AND AStates News ServiceMarch 11, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 5707 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: CANBERRA, Australia BodyThe following information was released by the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia:Michael Fullilove:Well, Minister, thank you very much for that stocktake and I'm sure everybody here would associate ourselves with the goal that you've set of a secure, open and free internet. And welcome also, Toby Feakin.Perhaps, Minister, with your permission, I might go first to the Ambassador as he hadn't had a chance yet to speak. Toby, the Minister put on record the achievements of the strategy, but she also alluded to the fact that things are not necessarily going in a positive direction, as I think. Emperor Hirohito said towards the end of the Second World War.You're at the coalface of the cyberwars, if you like, does it noticeably feel that it is getting hotter and more lethal? Because just as an observer, a reader of the newspaper, without any sort of security clearance, that's how it feels to me.Ambassador Feakin:Thank you. Let me talk about that from a diplomatic point of view. Absolutely, it's getting warmer and they're the conversations that we have to have with partners who have a different view of how the internet should look and feel in the future. There is no doubt that we're in a hotly-contested area and I think the Minister mentioned that in her speech, these various different bodies that are being set up through the UN where these conversations are going to be progressed and moved forward.But we have these conversations through so many different organisations as well, be they ICANN, where the future of the internet is been grappled with. And yes, there are countries that have a very space-centric view of how these things should be done; with a different view of how human rights is interpreted in the online space and to be frank, how our societies would function as a consequence of that.So I think we do live in an incredibly contested moment, and you allude to the fact that there is also a change, if you like, in the cyber environment in terms of what's going on technically. Part of that is down to the fact that we are more transparent and we are more open in terms of saying what's going on because we feel some of these behaviours do have to stop. But part of it is also that increased numbers of countries now have these capabilities and don't utilise them with the similar kind of framework that Mike Burgess will no doubt talk about when he makes his speech in the coming weeks.Michael Fullilove:Let me ask you, just to follow up, on this question of attribution that the Minister talked about. It's a very interesting development. And as the Minister alluded in December, for example, we, along with a number of other countries attributed a campaign of cyber-enabled commercial intellectual property theft to a group acting on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. Can you talk us through, Toby, how does the attribution process work? What are the basis on which we make a decision to attribute? Does Australia ever attribute by itself? Does it only ever attribute with other partners? Tell us how that process works, if you would.Ambassador Feakin:Yeah. Absolutely. It'd be interesting to get a number of hands. I mean, who would guess in the audience that attribution was done just by technical means? Hands up. Well, that's good. That's a good starting point. Then we're certainly changing the discussion because often there is this sense that you need 100 per cent absolute information from a technical point of view because we are dealing with computers essentially, and that isn't actually the case. When we're looking at attribution, we look across all the different equities that that decision requires.So of course, we'll want an intelligence assessment of certainty. If we're attributing with another country, what degree of damage or harm has that caused Australia, the Australian economy, the Australian Government; what kind of policy environment are we in. And then, we essentially meet across all of those equities and all of those different government partners and then make a decision based from that point. And obviously, the Foreign Minister plays an incredibly important role within that because obviously a lot of these issues then boil down to sensitivities with a bilateral relationship.Michael Fullilove:And Minister, you mentioned the attack on Australia's democratic institutions but I think that, if I'm correct, the Prime Minister referred to the culprit in that case as a sophisticated state actor. He didn't attribute it to a particular country. So why haven't we attributed that attack yet?Minister Payne:I think, as I said, when I was speaking Michael, that it is still being examined because it is so complex and has significant technical elements. So, that is work that I don't think a Government would ever want to rush, nor would intelligence agencies or technical specialists and professionals. So that is still being considered.But from a government's point of view, we've taken that very seriously, briefed the political parties appropriately to make sure that they are all informed and aware of potential vulnerabilities and able to address those.Michael Fullilove:Does that mean when the investigation is complete, we will attribute that attack?Minister Payne:Well, I think, as we were saying earlier, each of these circumstances is very different and this is different again. So, assessments are made based on the nature of the circumstances and I wouldn't like to say, at this point in time, whether that will ultimately be the case or not. That will ultimately be a decision for government.Michael Fullilove:Let me ask you one or two questions about 5G, if I may. I know it's not what you discussed today but it's obviously a closely related issue.We're seeing a divergent response from likeminded countries, at least that's the way it seems to me, in the sense that Australia, New Zealand and the United States have said that Huawei cannot participate in building our domestic 5G networks. But we at least have seen reporting in the FT, I think, and elsewhere that some in the British intelligence establishment are not necessarily sold on the idea that Huawei should be excluded. So, can I ask you, Minister, again because this is one of these questions that if you don't have access to security classifications, it's hard sometimes to make a judgment why should a company like Huawei be ruled out of providing that 5G technology in a country like Australia?Minister Payne:So I think what we have been very careful to emphasise, Michael, is that we have taken the strongest advice from intelligence agencies in this country, the strongest technical advice, as to the best way to protect Australia's national interests in the establishment of a 5G network here. As a member of the National Security Committee, that's the advice upon which I rely. We took a long time to consider the implications and to come to that decision.And we have, where appropriate and possible, been prepared to share that information, in appropriate circumstances - not publicly, in intelligence terms. So we are resolved on the position that Australia has taken. Other countries will make their own decisions. But for us to protect Australia's national security, to ensure that the priorities of any business involved in our communications network to place first Australia's protection and Australia's national security, that is the decision we've made.Michael Fullilove:You may well have seen the tweet by President Trump in late February where he it's a bit hard to read it but he seemed to offer an olive branch to Beijing in relation to Huawei. And he said this, "I want the United States to win through competition not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies."Obviously, that would be extremely awkward if the United States were to change its policy on 5G after we've made our decision. How did you read that communication from the president?Minister Payne:I think the engagement between our intelligence agencies has been very important in our decision making process and we'll continue to prioritise that. I think it's important though also to recognise that every country will make a sovereign decision. They'll make their own decisions based on their own national interests. The one Australia has made is not directed at any one company, or two companies, or five companies, or eight companies. It's directed at protecting our national interest.Michael Fullilove:Yes, Toby.Ambassador Feakin:[indistinct] On the 5G question, because I think it's something that obsesses a lot of time now in this position and between countries bilaterally. I'm sure, Minister, you've been asked this question more times than you can care to remember. And again, I think let's put into context - a lot of people probably imagine it just means another number on your phone. So instead of four, you see five; it's not the case. It's a comprehensive infrastructure change in the way that we do business and the way that our societies will function.So it's not just that extra number, it's about how all of your IT devices will communicate with each other, how any driverless car will function in the future. So it's one of the most fundamentally important infrastructure decisions a country will make. And so the decision that Australia has made, as the Minister absolutely rightly said, it's not about a particular company, it's about making decisions around that technology and what you're comfortable with. And as a country, we decided we couldn't take a decision where you could separate out parts of that infrastructure and take a risk mitigation approach.For national security reasons and for the security of that infrastructure in the future, it was important to show that we could make a decision around where companies linkages led back to, what kind of policies they held that were in close association with a given country where they were based.So, the decisions around it were more about accountability and transparency, again, which is something which is so, so important. We need to be able to trust that infrastructure and all the things that we then go forward to deliver on the back of it.So whilst yes, we sit and watch sovereign decisions which they all are I think Australia's decision has been admired around the world. And certainly, frequent request through my position and I'm sure through yours, Minister is well, how did you meet that decision and what's some of that information, and we've been quite comfortable sharing that.Michael Fullilove:Toby, you may have seen a speech by the former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last week, I think, where he's talking about some of these questions and explaining it to a British audience. One point I thought he made that was very interesting was that he noted the fact that there is no- given the historic the historic advances that countries like the UK and Australia, and the United States have made in Wi-Fi technology and so on, how unfortunate is that that none of none of these like-minded countries have a carrier that seems to be able to provide the 5G technology that we're all going to need.Why is that? Am I right that the two- there's only four companies, I think Malcolm was saying, that are in a position to provide it; two are European continent, and two are from China. Why do you think it is that none of these very innovative countries in the Anglophone world have succeeded in this realm?Ambassador Feakin:Interesting. I was chuckling because there's a fair few conversations that I've been involved in when the prime minister was the prime minister on that front.Michael Fullilove:So, you've got a good answer?[Laughter]Ambassador Feakin:Well, yeah, no, I'll have to duck some of those conversations.Minister Payne:I'm not entirely sure he can share it all, but...Ambassador Feakin:Yeah, exactly. So I'll allude to it but not share; if that's okay. That's not very transparent, is it?[Laughter]So, I think one of the biggest questions...Minister Payne: [indistinct] limiting otherwise.Toby Feakin:Exactly, I've got to be super careful now. So one of the interesting things, one of the questions that's often asked is about price point, okay? And the fact that some of our- some of the companies in China have taken decisions to make huge investments in this area of technology. And I guess for the policy wonks out there, go and read any of the kind of policy documents that the Chinese Government puts around us, and you start seeing why. It's about being technologically at the front of every single curve.However, price point is one issue. It could be cheap to begin with, but the thing is with the other companies and I have to be careful, because I'm not working for those companies and I can't advocate for them but actually, the through -life cost of the kind off, if you like, assurance and trust that that brings, actually lowers itself out in the longer term.So you're right, there are some, particularly Scandinavian countries, who have capability in this area and they are making rapid advancements in terms of promoting their proposition globally now. And we're certainly seeing that shift dramatically, from even six to 12 months ago, that race is proceeding at pace.Michael Fullilove:Let me ask one more question, then I want to go to the audience and give them an opportunity to ask a question to either Minister or the Ambassador.Minister, you mentioned also the undersea internet cable that's being built between Australia, PNG, and the Solomons. The history of that, of course, is that in late 2016, the Solomons Government signed a deal with Huawei to lay a cable to Australia. And subsequently, the Australian Government agreed with Honiara to take over and, I think, fund about two-thirds, from memory, of the project and also to connect it to PNG. Why did Australia make that decision?Minister Payne:Well, I think we've been very clear in recent years particularly, and the Pacific Step Up which the Prime Minister announced and built on at the end of last year is reflective of that, that we want to be the security partner of choice in the region, that we have capacity to support our regional neighbours, our Pacific family, particularly in infrastructure development.And the natural progression of that, from this investment to now, is the announcement of the Australia Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific, which we announced also at the end of last year.As I said in my remarks, being in Honiara to actually be at the sod turn for the landing site of the cable was really a tangible reminder of what a difference that this will make for communities across our region, whether it's in Papua New Guinea or in the Solomon Islands.So, Australia has the capacity to assist; we've been working extremely closely with these countries over many, many years. I personally visited the Solomon Islands a number of times during the RAMSI period a different form of support and engagement - but I think this is a reflection of the maturity of the relationship, and also a contribution, a really important infrastructure contribution that we can make in the region.The most excited of all of the people I think that I met were young Solomon Islanders who are so much looking forward to being able to work and to study in a different way that we completely take for granted. It's also timely in terms of this discussion to contemplate how, for example, the Solomon Islands Electoral Commission will run their election at the beginning of April. They will have something like 1200 polling places across the islands of the Solomon Islands nation. We will send some observers to that, but we can't even scratch the surface really in the process of observing an election like that with an IT capacity that will be changed completely by this cable. Their election after this will be a totally different ballgame.So I think they are tangible manifestations of how Australia can engage and support. We have the Australian Electoral Commission there now working with the Solomon Islands Electoral Commission in the delivery of this upcoming ballot. But by the time we get to the one beyond this, it will be a completely different world and that is real change, real advancement and real development.Michael Fullilove:Alright. Thank you Minister. So let me- there's a number of hands that are up. I'll go first, I saw Jamie Tarabay from The New York Times, in the second row and I saw the lady in front of her.Question:Good morning, thank you- well, good afternoon, sorry. I'm a little jetlagged. I have-Minister Payne:It's a permanent state.Question:Sorry, sorry?Minister Payne:Permanent state.Question:I apologise. I have two questions and separately I have a million questions about Syria but we can talk about that another time.Two questions - so regarding 5G and Huawei, Australia's made this decision which is [indistinct], how do you then marry your national security interests when you are dealing with countries that have these agreements like PNG, to allow Huawei to set up their 5G network. How do you enforce security barriers to maintain the integrity of the Australian communications network?And my second question, oh my God, it's coming to me. Yeah, on attribution, the attribution was unique in and of itself, with the thought process in coming out and sort of naming a sophisticated state actor and then following on from Michael's question about what you do then, will you name, what will the consequences of that be and are you considering- what kind of responses are you considering? It'd be really nice to sort of get a sense of your thought process there.Thank you.Minister Payne:I don't think I'm going to spit ball that with you. That's a decision for a sovereign government and we'll make that in due course. But in relation to how we interact with our counterparts, neighbours, allies, whatever category they fall into is as we usually do, we manage differences in approach, differences in technologies, differences in platforms all the time across our closest allies and partners, and more broadly, on a daily basis. So we have effective working relationships built over many, many years by posts in country, by Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Home Affairs officials who work carefully between our counterparts. That is business as usual for us.Ambassador Feakin:The Minister spoke of these 40 different projects that we're running around the region, a core focus of that is around cyber security awareness, threat awareness. So all these decisions are being made on a sovereign basis. But what we can do is we can assist countries in understanding risks and potential responses for them on a daily basis, underpinning their digital economy futures, understanding the risks that might be posed, assisting them in up-skilling their ability to respond to cyber-criminal activity within their borders as well.Minister PayneOne of the things I referred to in my remarks was the decision of the Pacific Island Forum to specifically refer to cyber security in the Boe Declaration, security declaration of that meeting. That is a step change in terms of issues under consideration and that I think marries well with the work that Toby does, which goes from cyber boot camps to the most sophisticated technical engagements around the region and more broadly.Question:Thank you. My name is Annie Edwards from the Institute for Global Peace and Sustainable Governance. My question is directed to the Minister. What are the connections or implications, if there are any, in the Chinese foreign investment policy and the Australian Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme? I believe there are about nine signatories to this scheme at the moment.Minister Payne:Well, again, we took a decision in 2017-18 to make sure that in terms of foreign influence - separate from foreign investment - in terms of foreign influence, we are protecting Australia's national interests. We legislated for that through the parliamentary process and I think that was a message from the Government that for anyone who seeks to interfere in and to intervene in the democratic processes in Australia, that that is not something any elected government in this country is prepared to support, no matter where they come from. And we have certainly seen, as I said in my remarks, a number of examples in recent times internationally, of efforts by state actors and non-state actors to interfere in other countries. We are protecting ourselves and that is what the citizens of Australia expect us to do. It is the first obligation of government to protect our citizens and to protect our country. In terms of foreign investment more broadly, we enthusiastically welcome foreign investment in Australia and have very strong relationships across the international panoply of businesses and countries who have engaged with us over a very long period of time. That continues to be the case. Some of those because of the nature of those investments are assessed, for example, by the Foreign Investment Review Board. You would always expect that to be the case because, again, the role of the Government is to consider our national interests.Michael Fullilove:Alright, I'll take a question from this gentleman here and then that lady over there has been trying to get my attention. So, in the second row, please. If you could just state your name and any affiliation [indistinct] question.Question:Of course. No worries. Good morning, everyone. I'm Daniel from the Fiji consulate here in Sydney. Thank you, Dr Fullilove, and the Lowy Institute team, for hosting another great event, and for the Minister and Ambassador for their respective remarks. Regrettably, my question is not about the Pacific but rather the role of technology in cyber companies like Google and Facebook in this space. Google, for instance, just announced that they won't be allowing any kind of political ads on their platform in Canada because they simply cannot comply with the now stringent verification process enshrined in Canadian law. So, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts about what the role of these companies will be, particularly given that we have both state and federal elections coming up here in Australia.Ambassador Feakin:Happy to take that one, Minister, if you like.Minister Payne:I was going to say: I'm sure they'll be only good.Ambassador Feakin:We have a really productive relationship with those companies. I mean, it has to be a two-way dialogue continually and has been through election task forces that have been set up through the Government and will continue to be through the electoral cycle. I think we do appreciate- and actually, interestingly, I was just with one of my counterparts in San Francisco who's the Danish tech ambassador, and he's actually based in Silicon Valley to ensure that there is diplomatic representation with the big providers be they Google, Facebook or whatever that might be because that conversation does need maturing at the top level and I think wherever you sit, be it in the private sector or in government, there's an acknowledgement of that. But in relation to the conversations that take place: that's a continual, continual cycle.Michael Fullilove:Can I ask you, Minister, just a question following on from that: you mentioned the attack on our Parliament and on our political parties; should Australians feel nervous? As the questioner asks: we have a federal election coming up, probably in May; we have state elections in New South Wales and other elections coming up, and of course we've watched with dismay, really, the evidence that emerged of Russia seeking to interfere in the presidential election and in other elections. How confident can Australians feel that our institutions are properly protected from outside interference from other countries?Minister Payne:And again, back to the first role of government being to protect Australia's national interests and to protect Australian people and entities from that sort of effort externally. But it's fair to say, and I don't think I would be exaggerating and Toby will correct me if I am; but it requires constant vigilance. It's a full-time job, not just here but globally. So whether those who seek to exploit vulnerabilities in systems are doing it for profit, doing it for disruption, doing it malevolently for other reasons; it is a case of constant vigilance. So our agencies, our intelligence agencies, our technical specialists, companies which have a very important role to play from the corporate side of this, are a key part of making sure that we are taking every step to protect our systems; to protect our processes. We have been fortunate in Australia to date, but that does not mean that we rest on our laurels. So, in in relation to upcoming elections, whether they are being run by state electoral commissions or the Australian Electoral Commission, this is a core part core part of everyday business; ensuring those processes are protected from external influence and interference.And it is, of course, also something that we discuss across the region. There are a lot of elections in the region in the coming year. In fact, I think I've counted- we're almost up to a dozen across the region. So it is a matter of great focus for us. We have expertise in Australia which we can share more broadly, but our first focus is on protecting ourselves.Michael Fullilove:Toby, on that subject: what role does deterrence have to play in stopping these adversaries getting their hands dirty in our internal affairs? For example, we know now that during the presidential campaign, of course the Americans became aware of some of the actions of Russia. We know through extensive reporting that President Obama shirt-fronted President Putin to use a phrase and told him to stop it; but obviously he didn't stop it. And there have been a lot of criticisms of the weakness of the Obama administration's approach a lot of analysts saying, for example, that Western countries should have used its information to really impose a cost on President Putin, perhaps a personal cost. And you've seen, there's lots of reporting to the effect that they might have disclosed the fact and the source of various ill-gotten gains that he allegedly holds himself, for example. So, how much- what role does deterrence have? I mean, you can stop- you can put up all the walls, but at a certain point don't you have to say to the people who are interfering with you: if you continue to do this there is going to be a cost that you pay?Ambassador Feakin:Yes. And that is an incredibly loud discussion in the international environment right now, and you mentioned, both the Minister and yourself, Michael, mentioned some of the attributions that have taken place, and I think what's notable about them are the number of countries that are now contributing jointly. It's fair to say, I think, if you look back at the history of the US/China discussion if you go back to 2014/15 when the discussions between Xi and Obama took place in California. You know, there was an understanding that there was so much bilaterally they could do, but to actually really reshape behaviour in cyberspace it had to be done jointly. So, one thing that we've done very actively is try to create more of a community of countries who are willing to come along on the journey, and that's not without its complexities of sharing intelligence and information and, you know, making sure that you're all aligned and timed at the right moment. But that, of course, is one step in a process. And there is a very loud discussion, again in the international environment, about what- are there other costs that you can impose on countries to try and squeeze their operating space?The Americans, obviously, are very forward-leaning in this regard and for many years have looked to actually pinpoint individuals within specific organisations, be they Ministry of State Security; be they the GRU in Russia. And, if you like, reshape that misnomer that attribution is impossible because that still seems to exist in many conversations, and say: well look, you can choose to do these things, but actually, we can pinpoint who you are and we can understand who you are and impose a cost on you as an individual; as you as an organisation; and then you as a nation. It's a process at the moment, though. So, if you like, it's a work in progress and we're working as hard as we can to change what's going on because these UN bodies that are about to meet this year: they have a really focused, important role in stating what if you like the rules are around that grey space. Anything below the level of armed conflict; that's where the grey space exists, that's what's being exploited mercilessly by a whole range of countries. But let's be frank, if you go back to the 2013 UNGGE and talk about international law in the entirety of the UN charter, applying in cyberspace, that would include elections.So, we've already agreed to that, yet that is something that's already being- we've seen in the past has been pushed on. So, it's a good question and it's something that is probably one of the most live topics that we're dealing with through this position and across Government.Minister Payne:And one of the reasons for that, if I may say, is because each case is absolutely unique. So even in the amount of time that I've been in this role, I've not seen a case which you can say: like equals like. They're completely different manifest in different ways, they're discovered in different ways, they're prosecuted in different ways and I think that really gives you some idea, or hopefully gives you some idea, of the complexity of the examination that government has to go through before it makes a decision for this.Michael Fullilove:Alright. And I'll give the last question, as I said, to the lady there.Question:My name is Sarah Pavillard, I'm the CEO of a consultancy called ADROITA. My question is really for the Minister. Given the policy is essentially to maintain a secure, open and free internet, and we've also discussed today that heating up of the threat environment, is there sufficient investment in offensive and defensive cyber capabilities forecast in an integrated investment plan that is being run by Defence? And is that IIP sufficiently agile to meet the potential threat to cyberspace in terms of that open, free and secure environment?Minister Payne:If I can just indulgently say I love the fact that you've asked a question about the IIP - the Integrated Investment Program - that underpinned the 2016 Defence white paper to which I'm personally very attached.[Laughter]And therefore, it's a very good question. And I think if the person sitting here instead of me was Major General Marcus Thompson, then for example, he would enthusiastically advocate his cause for the work that he and his unit within the ADF are doing, working closely with the Australian Signals Directorate, which of course has been stood up separately as a statutory agency in its own right, with increased independence and staffing to exactly address the sorts of challenges that we are facing going forward. Would all of the components that fit within that space - offensive and defensive cyber - would they all say they want more resources and they want more people? I think the answer is: yes. But we work constantly to review the challenges, to review the shifts and changes in the international environment, to make sure that we are responsive and that we are supporting the professionals in the way that we need to and providing the resourcing that we need to.Just after ASD stood up separately on 1 July last year, I went to Russell to an all-staff event. That doesn't happen very often in the Australian Signals Directorate. To say that there is a level of commitment and enthusiasm for the task that they do would be an understatement. I wouldn't be selling them strongly enough. They are hugely professional, they are changing and they're working hard to make sure that that change makes them as responsive and capable as they can be. So I'm confident that we review, regularly, that we support the advice and the feedback provided to us by their leaders, people like Mike Burgess, who you will see here very shortly, people like Major Marcus Thompson, people like Alastair MacGibbon at the ACSC. All of those entities, backed in the international context by our own Cyber Ambassador, are part of how we're addressing this challenge and I think that we have a very significant focus.Michael Fullilove:Ladies and gentlemen, we're out of time. I apologise that I didn't get to everybody. There was a lot of interest today and- but as Marise says, bide your time. We have other cyber speakers coming. Before I thank my speakers, Let me just mention two forthcoming events. First of all, later this week my colleague Alex Oliver will host a very interesting discussion between Gareth Evans, one of Marise's predecessors as Foreign Minister, and Michael Kirby, the former justice of the High Court, on Australia's role in nuclear proliferation and disarmament. And then, as we've discussed, on 27 March we'll be hosting the head - the DG - of ASD Mike Burgess. There is an enormous amount of interest in that event. So if you are interested in coming to that please register immediately.Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank Ambassador Toby Feakin and Senator Marise Payne for coming along, for making themselves available on a very interesting topic. It's not an easy one to address publicly. I appreciate the transparency that they've shown in answering my questions and your questions. It's a very interesting topic indeed, and I'd like to thank both of them, and let me thank, in particular, the Minister. She's been here as Minister now a number of times. We always appreciate her presence. One of our questioners complained about jet lag, but of course, no one can beat the Australian Foreign Minister of the day in terms of jet lag. So thank you for coming and for being as articulate as ever, despite any jet lag you might have.

Germany says Huawei must provide assurances on dataCNN WireFebruary 5, 2019 Tuesday 3:27 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 347 wordsByline: By Charles Riley, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  Huawei is facing growing pressure from Germany to guarantee it will not hand over data to the Chinese government. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told students during a trip to Japan that "there are big discussions about Huawei" in Germany as the country develops super-fast fifth generation, or 5G, telecommunications networks. "We need to talk to China to ensure that companies do not simply give up all data that is used to the Chinese state," said Merkel. She added that "safeguards" were needed to protect data. Huawei's business has come under threat as an increasing number of governments express concern that its technology could be used by Chinese spies.The company denies that its products are a security risk. It also maintains that it is a privately owned company with no ties to the Chinese government. Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent after business hours in China.The specific assurances being sought by Germany were not immediately clear on Tuesday. German carrier Deutsche Telekom said last year it was taking the discussion about Chinese manufacturers "very seriously.""We are pursuing a multi-vendor strategy for the network elements used (manufacturers primarily Ericsson, Nokia, Cisco, Huawei)," it said in December. "Nevertheless we currently reevaluate our procurement strategy."Huawei has spent decades building a strong presence in scores of markets around the world, helped by reliable hardware and competitive pricing. It is the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, and last year overtook Apple as the second biggest supplier of smartphones. It expects to overtake Samsung in that category by 2020.Huawei's leaders accept that the environment is becoming more hostile."In the next few years, the overall situation will not be as optimistic as we imagined. We must prepare for hardships," Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said in November.Sherisse Pham, Stephanie Halasz and Angus Watson contributed reporting.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

KING PRESSES TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ON THREATS FACING UNITED STATESStates News ServiceJanuary 29, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 585 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Maine Senator Angus King:U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) questioned the leaders of America's intelligence community on the global threat landscape during today's Senate Intelligence Committee's hearing -- including increased cooperation between China and Russia, the current political dynamics in Venezuela, the deep connection between Huawei and the Chinese government, Iran's nuclear activities, and the use of "deep fake" technology to mislead the American public and distort the electoral process.During the hearing, Senator King touched on a number of important topics, including:Huawei's ties to the Chinese government: "On Huawei, it seems to me they have to decide they are either going to be a worldwide telecommunications company or an agent of the Chinese government. They can't be both. And right now, they're trying to be both. And I think the world's customers which the Chinese are certainly sensitive to are the best enforcers of that principal." (Beginning at 1:12)Increased cooperation between Russia and China: "For a generation, that hasn't been the case. That could turn out to be a very big deal on the horizon in terms of the United States. If those two countries begin to work together systemically, that that could be a big problem for us." (Beginning at 4:21)The use of 'deep fake' technology to mislead the American people: "One thing we're worried about is 'deep fake'... That's when they use technology to create essentially a false reality, an apparent speech by a candidate where different words are coming out of their mouth than what they actually said. Here's my question. If in the next two years and particularly in the year preceding the next election, your agency determines that this is happening, and that it's sponsored by a foreign entity, will you inform the candidates that are the victims of this, the committees. My concern is it's one thing for the Intelligence Community to know this is happening, but if they don't inform the people who are being victimized, who are being attacked in this way, I think that really blunts the effectiveness of the availability of the intelligence...I just want to be sure our policies keep pace with the magnitude and accelerated nature of the threat." (Beginning at 4:52)During the hearing, Senator King also addressed the ongoing internal conflict in Venezuela, recent reports that the Taliban has suggested it would support preventing Afghanistan from becoming a platform for international terrorist groups, and asked CIA Director Gina Haspel if Iran continues to abide by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which President Trump exited in May 2018. In addition to Director Haspel, witnesses before the Intelligence Committee today were Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Christopher Wray, Director of the National Security Agency General Paul Nakasone, Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Robert Cardillo, and Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency Gen.

Huawei, a manageable risk for 5G: United KingdomCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 18, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1029 wordsBody The British government concluded that it can mitigate the risk of using Huawei equipment in 5G networks, which represents a major blow to US efforts to convince allies to ban the Chinese supplier of telecommunication systems. high speed.  The National Cybersecurity Center of the United Kingdom (NCSC) determined that there are ways to limit the risks of using Huawei in future 5G ultrafast networks, two people familiar with the findings told the Financial Times. they are made public.  The conclusion comes despite the US intensifying its efforts to convince different European countries to exclude Huawei from its networks on the basis that it can help China spy or sabotage via cybernetics.  The US National Security Agency (NSA) has shared information with its allies and partners to highlight the risks, but several European countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany, are not convinced that a veto is justified .  A person familiar with the debate assured that the British conclusion "will have a great weight" with the European leaders, since the United Kingdom has access to sensitive information from the US intelligence through its accession to the network to share intelligence data. Five Eyes  "Other countries can argue that if the British trust that threats to national security can be mitigated, then they can also reassure the public and the US administration that they act prudently by continuing to allow their providers of telecommunications services use Chinese components, as long as they take the precautions recommended by the British, "said this person.  EU argues that 5G will be so fast - and will have so many military applications - that the risk of using any Chinese telecommunications equipment is very high. US officials also presented the argument that, although there is no evidence of dangerous activity so far, Huawei could use malicious software updates to facilitate espionage.  Robert Hannigan, former head of GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters), the UK signaling agency, recently wrote in the FT that the NCSC "never found evidence of malicious cyber activity by the Chinese state through Huawei "and that" any claim that any Chinese technology anywhere in a 5G network represents an unacceptable risk is nonsense. "  The United Kingdom's conclusion contrasts with Australia and New Zealand (also members of Five Eyes) that last year banned telecommunications providers from using Huawei equipment in 5G networks.  It also occurs when Donald Trump evaluates issuing an executive order that would effectively prohibit US companies from using equipment from the Chinese firm. A person familiar with the order stressed that it would be written in such a way that it was "agnostic of company and country."  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Mike Pence, the US vice president, said Huawei posed a threat because of a law requiring telecom companies to share data with the Chinese government.  In the same forum, Jens Stoltenberg, leader of NATO, told the FT that the alliance takes "seriously" the concerns about Huawei and that several members seek a joint response.  "We have to analyze the level of coordination we need to respond. We still do not come to a conclusion as an alliance, but it shows the need to address that problem, "he said.  Alex Younger, head of MI6, the service ofSecret intelligence from the United Kingdom said Friday that Britain could take a softer line on Huawei than the US, and said the issue is too complex to simply ban the company. He stressed that it is "a more complicated issue than inside or outside" and that countries have "a sovereign right to find an answer to all this".  The NCSC did not dispute that the determination that the risk of using technology from the Asian firm can be contained. He said he has "a unique monitoring and understanding" of the Chinese firm and expects it to address the engineering and security issues highlighted in a report last year by the Huawei Cybersecurity Assessment Supervisory Board, the which headed the head of the NCSC.  The next board report is expected to be critical of Huawei's failure to meet previous demands on equipment, supply chain risks and software engineering.  The NCSC also contributes to a government review of the telecommunications infrastructure of the United Kingdom, which should start in the spring. The report will likely contain recommendations on how to handle any Chinese spy threat that Huawei may pose to 5G networks, according to a person who has information on the first draft. The United Kingdom is expected to recommend a variety of providers and partial restrictions of areas of the 5G network, he added.  "It is not inherently desirable that a portion of the important national critical infrastructure be provided by a monopolistic provider," Younger said.  Other European intelligence officials are also concerned that Huawei has access to 5G networks. But while nations like France and Germany advise caution, they are unlikely to demand a total ban.  Eric Xu, one of Huawei's three rotating presidents, criticized Washington's campaign to pressure countries to ban equipment from the company, and questioned if there were no ulterior motives. "Some people say that because these countries use our equipment, it becomes more difficult for EU agencies to obtain data from these nations," he said.  Tactic  Over the weekend, Huawei's rotating president, Xu Zhijun, accused the US of creating a "coordinated and tactical geopolitical campaign."  Politics  The executive said that the current debates around 5G technology revolve around "political issues".  Counterattack  The statements come after the tour that Eastern European Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made in Eastern Europe, who warned of the growing presence of Huawei in the region.  Brand territory  During his visit, Pompeo expressed his misgivings about the plans of the Chinese giant to install a logistics center in Hungary.  Ensures investment  Xu assured that Huawei will invest more than 2 billion dollars over the next five years to improve the cybersecurity of its equipment, including the rewriting of some codes. Load-Date: February 18, 2019End of Document

Daimler and Geely team up to build Smart cars in ChinaCNN WireMarch 28, 2019 Thursday 9:57 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 279 wordsByline: By Charles Riley, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  Daimler has teamed up with Geely to transform its Smart brand into an electric carmaker focused on China's vast market. Under the agreement announced Thursday, the next generation of Smart cars will be assembled at a plant in China with sales starting in 2022. Prior to that, Daimler will continue to produce Smart cars at plants in France and Slovenia. "Our smallest vehicle still has huge potential --- in China and beyond. Geely is the right partner to take advantage of these opportunities," Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche wrote in a blog post. Daimler and Geely will each own 50% of the global joint venture. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Daimler said no jobs would be lost as a result of the agreement.Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler launched its Smart brand two decades ago, but the tiny cars never caught on with consumers. Only 130,000 Smart cars were sold worldwide in 2018. Yet the brand's focus on urban mobility and electric technology makes it attractive to Geely, which already owns Volvo and is based in the world's largest market for electric cars.The Chinese government has encouraged carmakers to develop and sell electric cars by offering generous subsidies and tax breaks. China accounts for about half of global electric car sales. Daimler had already announced plans to focus entirely on electric drive Smarts by 2020. It said sales of the existing electric Smart model doubled in 2018.Other global automakers, including Daimler's Germany rivals Volkswagen and BMW, are investing heavily in electric cars and new mobility technology. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

INTERVIEW WITH LAURA INGRAHAM OF THE LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW PODCASTUS Fed NewsJanuary 24, 2019 Thursday 5:10 PM  ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 2041 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Jan. 24 -- The U.S. Department of State issued the following transcript of remarks by the U.S. Secretary of State:QUESTION: Joining us now is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. I'm delighted he's with us. We're going to get the most up-to-date information from him on where this all stands, and he joins us now. Mr. Secretary, thanks for joining us.SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, it's great to be with you.QUESTION: So the concern now that Politico is writing about is that we're leaving U.S. diplomats in Venezuela, and concern for their safety. We remember of course what happened in Benghazi. What can we do to reassure the American people that our diplomats are going to be safe during this time of tumult?SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, you should know, and your listeners should all know, that we are continuously, 24/7, evaluating security conditions. There's no higher priority for the State Department than to keep all the people in our missions safe and secure. And we've made clear to the Maduro regime that it is our expectation that they will be safe and secure. And we will continue to evaluate.We do this in our missions all across the world every day. We certainly have a real focus here and some of the other places that have greater security threats. But know that we are very focused on this, and we'll make the right decision. What we want to make sure that the - that former President Maduro knows is that he doesn't have the right to make the decision about whether or not we stay there. We now recognize the new, the interim President Guaido, and it is he who has asked us to be there under our diplomatic authority. And it's under that authority that we have the right to continue our diplomatic mission there in Caracas, in Venezuela. And we will continue to assert that right.We'll make the right decision about our team and how many and for how long they can stay, but know that we're focused on their security, but that they also have an important mission. The reason we want to be there is because we need a strong, democratic Venezuela where the humanitarian crisis, the disastrous conditions under which Maduro has let his people live for far too long, needs to be changed. And that's the State Department's mission. It's our focus there.QUESTION: The Russians, not happy about any of this, and they're warning against any military intervention by the United States. Many people concerned about this becoming a flashpoint between the U.S. and Russia, with some larger conflagration happening as a result. And just back to the security issue, if something should be done to threaten our diplomats and we have to go in, are there - is there a concern about triggering any larger conflict with Russia, perhaps even China?SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Laura, it is interesting to see how this glorious day yesterday, where the Venezuelan people rose up to take back their country - it's interesting to see how nations aligned. The free countries, the democratic countries of the world - Brazil, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, the list is long - they sided with freedom and democracy. And the folks who landed on the other side were Iran, Russia, and Cuba, along with China. I think that's very telling. I think that tells you a lot about former President Maduro and the kind of kleptocracy that he was running. And our mission, our mission is to make sure that we do everything we can to keep our people safe while continuing to help the Venezuelan people achieve the outcome which they now are responsible for ultimately achieving.QUESTION: Well, a lot of this has to do with the money that China has loaned Venezuela - $65 billion in loans. And I think still Venezuela owes them about 20 billion, so China wants its money back, above probably other things that they want, and influence and power in the Southern Hemisphere. They want that influence, and they want their money back, I imagine.SECRETARY POMPEO: I think that's right. I think the Cubans have been there running the security apparatus for an awfully long time, much to the detriment of the Venezuelan people. And yesterday a new page was turned. And I'm sure that we haven't seen the last of the efforts of the - the last throes of the Maduro regime, the attempt to sustain power. But your - but your listeners just have to know the United States is committed to helping make this democratic transition successful. We just today authorized some additional money to support the International Red Cross and some others to provide humanitarian relief inside the country.QUESTION: But if something should befall our diplomats, if there is a standoff, you're not ruling out asking the President to send military help into the region, are you?SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, we'll do the things we need to do to make sure we keep our people safe. I don't want to speculate or create a hypothetical situation that we can't account for. But know that the government is fully coordinated. I've spoken with all the other senior leaders in the United States Government just this morning. I spoke with our chief of mission there on the ground last night at 1700 hours. We have a 24/7 operation center up and running. We are fully engaged, we're fully aware of the situation on the ground, and we're prepared to do what it takes to make sure that we do everything we can to keep our people safe.QUESTION: On the shutdown issue, Mr. Secretary, you now have former DHS secretaries, including the former White House chief of staff John Kelly, urging the President and the Democrats to reopen the government, especially the budget of DHS needing to be funded. What is your reaction to that? Does that put added pressure on President Trump to give in to the Democrats on this entire issue of the shutdown?SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, goodness. Look, count me in in hoping that we can find a path forward to get the government back open. I think that'd be a good thing. But this is a political time, and a important set of issues that are being debated. And so I don't see it putting any more pressure on the President than it does on members of Congress. I didn't see the particular report that you're referring to -QUESTION: It's been all over.SECRETARY POMPEO: - but know this: The State Department is fully prepared to do the things we need to do. I've talked to people. I traveled last week throughout the Middle East. We have great patriots working for the State Department who understand that democracy is sometimes a little bit messy. That - Vladimir Putin's government never shuts down. It's unlikely that the ayatollah is going to shut down his government. And so we do have a process that sometimes leads to these things that I think everyone wishes didn't take place, but know that the State Department is prepared to do all that we can to continue to work through these difficult, challenging times.QUESTION: John Kerry over in Davos - I'm sure you heard - he was asked what he would advise the President.QUESTION: With that final word then, Secretary Kerry, if you had President Trump sitting right opposite you, what would your message to him be?SECRETARY KERRY: I can't play that - but I know that - you see, because he doesn't take any of this seriously. He doesn't have an ability to have that kind of conversation.QUESTION: So what would you say to him to get it through? What would your message be?SECRETARY KERRY: Resign.QUESTION: Okay.QUESTION: Your reaction to that, sir?SECRETARY POMPEO: To be honest with you, Laura, we don't spend a lot of time thinking about what John Kerry says in this administration. Frankly, we're trying to clean up his mess and the mess that the previous administration's left us. I think - I think it's pretty outrageous for a former secretary of state to be calling on a president of the United States to resign, but I suppose, beyond that, this isn't the first time John Kerry has behaved in this way that is inconsistent with what I think former secretaries of state ought to do, and I wish it weren't so.QUESTION: Yeah. Well, I mean, he's - he could have been prosecuted under the Logan Act for what he did in Iran, trying to do the negotiations ahead of everyone else. So it's rich that he would be saying that.Mr. Secretary, a lot of people are looking forward to new developments perhaps in our - again, it's a trade stand-off with China. As you know, I've supported this move with trade, taking a hard line given the cheating of China. What can you tell us about potential progress with the Chinese given the huge hit they've taken to their economy, much more pronounced than, of course, it's affected our country?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. So the slowdown in economic growth in China is very real and severe. There's no doubt about that. President Trump has been, as you know, has been pretty clear: we just want - we just want things to be fair and reciprocal. We want a set of arrangements that allow American workers to have the same opportunity that Chinese workers have. We want - we want our companies to be able to sell their goods into China without the risk that their intellectual property will be stolen or that they'll be forced to deliver their technology to the Chinese Government -QUESTION: I know. Are we any closer?SECRETARY POMPEO: - in exchange for the right.QUESTION: Are we any closer?SECRETARY POMPEO: I think progress is being made. I'm optimistic that Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin and the team are going to make real progress. I think it's going to take every day between now and the end of the time period the President allotted to dot the Is and cross the Ts. I hope they can come to an outcome that is one that will be consistent with what President Trump has been demanding now for months and months.QUESTION: And finally - I know you're out of time - are we making any progress - I know you've been working on this - with our Mexican counterparts, AMLO and his team, to help more with this crush of humanity coming up, another 10,000-person caravan, and what's happening at our southern border still? You saw that video of 500 migrants jumping the fence that the Daily Mail has posted. It's shocking. What could you do additionally with our Mexican counterparts to end this constant stream of migrants coming up?SECRETARY POMPEO: So this is a real challenge. It's an enormous national security challenge. It's completely appropriate that the Secretary of State is dealing with this, in addition to our Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security. My mission has been, is to try to get the Mexicans to understand this threat, to take seriously the security issues that surround it, to do what they can at their southern border to discourage the transit across Mexico out of Guatemala and Honduras. We've made a little bit of progress with them; there's just a lot more to do. It was - it's disheartening to see the large numbers, to see these caravans moving out of those countries into Mexico headed for our southern border. When I talked to Foreign Minister Ebrard, he understands our concerns deeply and I'm hopeful in the weeks ahead we'll make real progress in reducing this risk to American national security.QUESTION: Are you worried about Kamala Harris telling MSNBC last night that we have a President who conducts foreign policy by tweets?SECRETARY POMPEO: (Laughter.) I'm so worried that I had no idea she'd said it. No. This - our foreign policy is conducted in a way that is thoughtful, deliberative, and then forceful, and I think that's all you can ask from a commander-in-chief.

INTERVIEW WITH LAURA INGRAHAM OF THE LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW PODCASTStates News ServiceJanuary 24, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 2000 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:InterviewMichael R. PompeoSecretary of StateVia TeleconferenceQUESTION: Joining us now is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Im delighted hes with us. Were going to get the most up-to-date information from him on where this all stands, and he joins us now. Mr. Secretary, thanks for joining us.SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, its great to be with you.QUESTION: So the concern now that Politico is writing about is that were leaving U.S. diplomats in Venezuela, and concern for their safety. We remember of course what happened in Benghazi. What can we do to reassure the American people that our diplomats are going to be safe during this time of tumult?SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, you should know, and your listeners should all know, that we are continuously, 24/7, evaluating security conditions. Theres no higher priority for the State Department than to keep all the people in our missions safe and secure. And weve made clear to the Maduro regime that it is our expectation that they will be safe and secure. And we will continue to evaluate.We do this in our missions all across the world every day. We certainly have a real focus here and some of the other places that have greater security threats. But know that we are very focused on this, and well make the right decision. What we want to make sure that the that former President Maduro knows is that he doesnt have the right to make the decision about whether or not we stay there. We now recognize the new, the interim President Guaido, and it is he who has asked us to be there under our diplomatic authority. And its under that authority that we have the right to continue our diplomatic mission there in Caracas, in Venezuela. And we will continue to assert that right.Well make the right decision about our team and how many and for how long they can stay, but know that were focused on their security, but that they also have an important mission. The reason we want to be there is because we need a strong, democratic Venezuela where the humanitarian crisis, the disastrous conditions under which Maduro has let his people live for far too long, needs to be changed. And thats the State Departments mission. Its our focus there.QUESTION: The Russians, not happy about any of this, and theyre warning against any military intervention by the United States. Many people concerned about this becoming a flashpoint between the U.S. and Russia, with some larger conflagration happening as a result. And just back to the security issue, if something should be done to threaten our diplomats and we have to go in, are there is there a concern about triggering any larger conflict with Russia, perhaps even China?SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Laura, it is interesting to see how this glorious day yesterday, where the Venezuelan people rose up to take back their country its interesting to see how nations aligned. The free countries, the democratic countries of the world Brazil, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, the list is long they sided with freedom and democracy. And the folks who landed on the other side were Iran, Russia, and Cuba, along with China. I think thats very telling. I think that tells you a lot about former President Maduro and the kind of kleptocracy that he was running. And our mission, our mission is to make sure that we do everything we can to keep our people safe while continuing to help the Venezuelan people achieve the outcome which they now are responsible for ultimately achieving.QUESTION: Well, a lot of this has to do with the money that China has loaned Venezuela $65 billion in loans. And I think still Venezuela owes them about 20 billion, so China wants its money back, above probably other things that they want, and influence and power in the Southern Hemisphere. They want that influence, and they want their money back, I imagine.SECRETARY POMPEO: I think thats right. I think the Cubans have been there running the security apparatus for an awfully long time, much to the detriment of the Venezuelan people. And yesterday a new page was turned. And Im sure that we havent seen the last of the efforts of the the last throes of the Maduro regime, the attempt to sustain power. But your but your listeners just have to know the United States is committed to helping make this democratic transition successful. We just today authorized some additional money to support the International Red Cross and some others to provide humanitarian relief inside the country.QUESTION: But if something should befall our diplomats, if there is a standoff, youre not ruling out asking the President to send military help into the region, are you?SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, well do the things we need to do to make sure we keep our people safe. I dont want to speculate or create a hypothetical situation that we cant account for. But know that the government is fully coordinated. Ive spoken with all the other senior leaders in the United States Government just this morning. I spoke with our chief of mission there on the ground last night at 1700 hours. We have a 24/7 operation center up and running. We are fully engaged, were fully aware of the situation on the ground, and were prepared to do what it takes to make sure that we do everything we can to keep our people safe.QUESTION: On the shutdown issue, Mr. Secretary, you now have former DHS secretaries, including the former White House chief of staff John Kelly, urging the President and the Democrats to reopen the government, especially the budget of DHS needing to be funded. What is your reaction to that? Does that put added pressure on President Trump to give in to the Democrats on this entire issue of the shutdown?SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, goodness. Look, count me in in hoping that we can find a path forward to get the government back open. I think thatd be a good thing. But this is a political time, and a important set of issues that are being debated. And so I dont see it putting any more pressure on the President than it does on members of Congress. I didnt see the particular report that youre referring to --QUESTION: Its been all over.SECRETARY POMPEO: -- but know this: The State Department is fully prepared to do the things we need to do. Ive talked to people. I traveled last week throughout the Middle East. We have great patriots working for the State Department who understand that democracy is sometimes a little bit messy. That Vladimir Putins government never shuts down. Its unlikely that the ayatollah is going to shut down his government. And so we do have a process that sometimes leads to these things that I think everyone wishes didnt take place, but know that the State Department is prepared to do all that we can to continue to work through these difficult, challenging times.QUESTION: John Kerry over in Davos Im sure you heard he was asked what he would advise the President.QUESTION: With that final word then, Secretary Kerry, if you had President Trump sitting right opposite you, what would your message to him be?SECRETARY KERRY: I cant play that but I know that you see, because he doesnt take any of this seriously. He doesnt have an ability to have that kind of conversation.QUESTION: So what would you say to him to get it through? What would your message be?SECRETARY KERRY: Resign.QUESTION: Okay.QUESTION: Your reaction to that, sir?SECRETARY POMPEO: To be honest with you, Laura, we dont spend a lot of time thinking about what John Kerry says in this administration. Frankly, were trying to clean up his mess and the mess that the previous administrations left us. I think I think its pretty outrageous for a former secretary of state to be calling on a president of the United States to resign, but I suppose, beyond that, this isnt the first time John Kerry has behaved in this way that is inconsistent with what I think former secretaries of state ought to do, and I wish it werent so.QUESTION: Yeah. Well, I mean, hes he could have been prosecuted under the Logan Act for what he did in Iran, trying to do the negotiations ahead of everyone else. So its rich that he would be saying that.Mr. Secretary, a lot of people are looking forward to new developments perhaps in our again, its a trade stand-off with China. As you know, Ive supported this move with trade, taking a hard line given the cheating of China. What can you tell us about potential progress with the Chinese given the huge hit theyve taken to their economy, much more pronounced than, of course, its affected our country?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. So the slowdown in economic growth in China is very real and severe. Theres no doubt about that. President Trump has been, as you know, has been pretty clear: we just want we just want things to be fair and reciprocal. We want a set of arrangements that allow American workers to have the same opportunity that Chinese workers have. We want we want our companies to be able to sell their goods into China without the risk that their intellectual property will be stolen or that theyll be forced to deliver their technology to the Chinese Government --QUESTION: I know. Are we any closer?SECRETARY POMPEO: -- in exchange for the right.QUESTION: Are we any closer?SECRETARY POMPEO: I think progress is being made. Im optimistic that Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin and the team are going to make real progress. I think its going to take every day between now and the end of the time period the President allotted to dot the Is and cross the Ts. I hope they can come to an outcome that is one that will be consistent with what President Trump has been demanding now for months and months.QUESTION: And finally I know youre out of time are we making any progress I know youve been working on this with our Mexican counterparts, AMLO and his team, to help more with this crush of humanity coming up, another 10,000-person caravan, and whats happening at our southern border still? You saw that video of 500 migrants jumping the fence that the Daily Mail has posted. Its shocking. What could you do additionally with our Mexican counterparts to end this constant stream of migrants coming up?SECRETARY POMPEO: So this is a real challenge. Its an enormous national security challenge. Its completely appropriate that the Secretary of State is dealing with this, in addition to our Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security. My mission has been, is to try to get the Mexicans to understand this threat, to take seriously the security issues that surround it, to do what they can at their southern border to discourage the transit across Mexico out of Guatemala and Honduras. Weve made a little bit of progress with them; theres just a lot more to do. It was its disheartening to see the large numbers, to see these caravans moving out of those countries into Mexico headed for our southern border. When I talked to Foreign Minister Ebrard, he understands our concerns deeply and Im hopeful in the weeks ahead well make real progress in reducing this risk to American national security.QUESTION: Are you worried about Kamala Harris telling MSNBC last night that we have a President who conducts foreign policy by tweets?SECRETARY POMPEO: (Laughter.) Im so worried that I had no idea shed said it. No. This our foreign policy is conducted in a way that is thoughtful, deliberative, and then forceful, and I think thats all you can ask from a commander-in-chief. Im proud to be his Secretary of State.QUESTION: And are you are you prepared to tell us therell be a new summit with North Korea in the next 60 days?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, therell be one in the next 60 days. Thats the plan.QUESTION: All right. Well, Mr. Secretary, we really appreciate your spending time with us on the Laura Ingraham Podcast. Really appreciate it. I know how busy you are.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, maam.QUESTION: Thank you so much.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Laura. Have a good day.QUESTION: All right. All right.

Geopolitics of 5GCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 30, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 650 wordsBody The telecommunications sector begins to shake as the development of equipment for the so-called 5G (fifth generation technology for voice, data and mobile video services) begins to become a reality and operators make plans to implement it in their networks. The problem is that the 5G will not be any technology, but a real revolution in the way we interact with the world. The speed of data transmission that this technology will allow is such that it will become the main access route for what the slang of the industry has called the Internet of Things.  Imagine a world not far away where cars will be driven by artificial intelligence permanently connected in real time to the Internet cloud, or railway systems or public transport that are not operated by people but by computer control centers. remote way. Imagine cities where access to all types of properties is controlled through the Internet. Imagine power plants, refineries or complete industries with robots that have artificial intelligence and always keep in touch with each other through the cloud. Imagine your home, your office or your business with lighting systems, heating, cooling, water, supply management, drainage, garbage disposal and entertainment controlled remotely by artificial intelligence.  The control of the 5G networks and, therefore, of all these systems is in dispute by the main powers. As of today, the Chinese technology of the Huawei and ZTE companies goes several years ahead of its western competitors in the development of equipment for the deployment of 5G networks. Huawei is the world's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and covers the entire supply chain, including the computer brains of telecommunications networks themselves. Imagine the accusations made by the United States, Australia, New Zealand and some European countries that Huawei's equipment allows espionage by the Chinese government to be true. Imagine that these computers have a hidden access that allows not only to extract information but also to have interference in the operation of all the equipment or systems connected through the 5G networks. Imagine an international conflict in which one of the parties has the possibility of sabotaging the transport, supply or production systems of a country or causing trains to collide, smart cars become weapons, money is eliminated from banking systems , the accesses and exits of all the buildings are closed or the systems and services with which the houses operate are blocked. Imagine a chapter of Black Mirror.  In recent months, Western attacks against Huawei have been growing. From recommendations that seem more orders from the US government so that none of its companies buy or operate Huawei equipment, until the arrest in Canada and the indictment by the United States this week against the director of finance of Huawei and other officials for alleged bank fraud, violation of sanctions against Iran and theft of intellectual property. In addition, a few weeks ago, Poland arrested a Huawei employee on charges of espionage.  Both the company and the Chinese government have denied these accusations and see in them a Western attempt to prevent the growth and technological development of Chinese companies. This is possible? Yes. Is it possible that China wants to have interference in the 5G networks of the world? As well. Is it possible for the United States to claim the same? Yes. Are the accusations true? Impossible to know. Is it a matter of national security? Definitely. The onlyThe fact is that American and European telecommunications companies are taking a certain attitude of suspicion against Chinese suppliers and, for the moment, many have suspended the purchase of Chinese equipment for the deployment of 5G networks. Other problems that 5G networks will face is its high cost and the absence of a clear and profitable business model. Load-Date: January 30, 2019End of Document

United States unseals indictments against China's Huawei and CFO WanzhouThe Acorn: Drew UniversityJanuary 29, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 382 wordsByline: Eleanor HarrisonBodyProsecutors are seeking to extradite the company's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, and allege she committed fraud by misleading banks about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.In a separate case, the Justice Department also accused two Huawei subsidiaries of ten counts of stealing trade secrets, wire fraud and obstructing justice for allegedly stealing robotic technology from carrier T-Mobile US Inc to test smartphones' durability.Meng's arrest December 1 touched off a political furor marked by days of angry anti-Canada rhetoric from China's foreign ministry, culminating Sunday in the firing of John McCallum as Canada's ambassador to China."Huawei and its senior executives repeatedly refused to respect US law" by misleading banks about the company's business and violating USA sanctions, FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a news conference Monday. Meng is free in Vancouver, staying at her $4.2 million mansion with Global Positioning System monitoring, after posting bail of $10 million as she fights extradition to the U.S.to face criminal charges.Ltd., the biggest telecommunications equipment maker in the world, took a sharp turn today with the unveiling of 23 criminal charges against the China-based company.The top USA law enforcement officials, including acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, held a news conference inWashington to announce the charges. Ltd, a company in Iran, in violation of US laws.Bad Timing for U.S.Wray said firms like Huawei "pose a dual threat to both our economic and national security, and the magnitude of these charges make clear just how seriously the Federal Bureau of Investigation takes this threat".A 10-count indictment alleges Huawei stole trade secrets from T-Mobile beginning in 2012.The United States, which has until Wednesday to formally request her extradition, said last week it would press ahead with the case.Meng's arrest has touched off an ongoing diplomatic furor that resulted Sunday in the firing of John McCallum as Canada's ambassador to China after he publicly expressed confidence in her ability to fight extradition to the United States.The charges come just two days before the Trump administration plans to resume trade talks with the Chinese government inWashington.Load-Date: January 29, 2019End of Document

Senate Judiciary Committee Issues Testimony From American Enterprise InstituteTargeted News ServiceMarch 12, 2019 Tuesday 7:32 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 10247 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Judiciary Committee issued the following testimony by Roslyn Layton is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, at a hearing entitled "GDPR &#38; CCPA: Opt-ins, Consumer Control, and the Impact on Competition and Innovation":"Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Con-sumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It is an honor. I am heartened by your bipartisanship on this im-portant issue. This testimony reflects my own views and research."My testimony is informed by working at Denmark's Center for Media and Information Technol-ogies at Aalborg University where we conduct research on privacy and security technologies. My academic research explores online privacy as a comprehensive framework incorporating in-stitutions, business practices, the type of technologies, and, most important, the level of the user's knowledge.1 As a mother of three Danish-American children, I also have a personal inter-est in whether the European rules work."Today I will identify the 10 key problems with the GDPR, which, if not addressed, will plague the CCPA. I will discuss evidence-based solutions for online privacy and data protection. These in-clude privacy enhancing technologies, consumer education, and standard setting. Finally, I will address why a strong federal standard supports a national digital economy, protects Americans' rights, and is supported by the Constitution.The 10 Problems with the GDPR"Here are the 10 key problems with the GDPR, and, if not properly amended, these will also plague the CCPA.1. The GDPR strengthens the largest players.2. The GDPR weakens small- and medium-sized firms.3. The GDPR is cost prohibitive for many firms.4. The GDPR silences free speech and expression.5. The GDPR threatens innovation and research.6. The GDPR increases cybersecurity risk.7. The GDPR and the CCPA create risks for identity theft and online fraud.8. The GDPR has not created greater trust online.9. The GDPR and the CCPA use the pretense of customer control to increase the power of government.10. The GDPR and the CCPA fail to meaningfully incorporate the role of privacy enhancing innovation and consumer education in data protection."To analyze a policy like the GDPR, we must set aside the political pronouncements and evaluate its real-world effects."The GDPR has strengthened the largest players. Since the implementation of the GDPR, Google, Facebook, and Amazon have increased their market share in the EU.2 Three things have happened. 3 (1) The high cost of GDPR compliance is an advantage for large firms which have larger budgets to pay for software upgrades and privacy professionals. (2) Companies have stopped using competing tracking tools to Google and Facebook, giving a greater share of the market to the established players. (3) Users are less likely to try new platforms and tools, stick-ing instead with the "devil they know" in the incumbent players."For those who study the empirical outcomes of regulation, it is not a surprise. As Nobel Prize Economist George Stigler observed more than 40 years ago, "Regulation is acquired by industry and operated for its benefit."4 Indeed larger firms may welcome the GDPR because it can insu-late them from competition."The GDPR has weakened small- and medium-sized firms. Small ad tech competitors have lost about one-third of their market share. The data show that the EU has not fostered an environ-ment in which small- and medium-sized companies grow."Despite some years of notice about the GDPR's coming implementation, only 20 percent of EU companies, primarily the large firms, are digitized.5 There is little to no data that show that small- to medium-sized companies are growing in the EU because of the regulation.6 The European Commission's digital scoreboard reports show a consistent lag in the small to medium enterprise segment, particularly to modernize their websites and market outside their own EU countries.7 One study suggests that small- and medium-sized ad tech competitors have lost up to one-third of their market position since the GDPR took effect.8"Many American retailers, game companies, and service providers no longer operate in the EU. The Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn websites are dark.9 The San Francisco-based Klout, an innovative online service that used social media analytics to rate its users according to online social influence, closed down completely.10 Drawbridge, an identity-management company from San Mateo, California, exited the EU and sold off its ad-tracking business because of the GDPR.11 Verve, a leading mobile marketing platform with offices in six US cities, closed its European operation in advance of the GDPR, affecting 15 EU employees.12"Valve, an award-winning video game company in Bellevue, Washington, shut down an entire game community rather than invest in GDPR compliance.13 Uber Entertainment, also based in Washington, similarly shut down one of its most popular games entirely after a six-year run because upgrading the platform to GDPR compliance was too expensive.14 California-based Gravity Interactive no longer offers games in the EU and refunded its European customers.15"The Las Vegas-based Brent Ozar Unlimited, which offers a range of information technology and software support services, stopped serving the EU.16 San Francisco's Payver, the dashboard camera app that pays drivers to collect road information on potholes, fallen road signs, and other inputs to build maps to improve the safety of self-driving cars, no longer supports the EU.17 Legal news website Above the Law describes the EU closures of Ragnarok Online, Unroll.me, SMNC, Tunngle, and Steel Root, noting that the GPDR is splintering the internet and that GDPR policymakers refused to listen to concerns from startups before the launch and now refuse to fix its problems.18 Even the Association of National Advertisers website is not available in the EU.19"The regulation has hurt the European venture capital market which funds startups. An important study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research and coauthored by the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) former chief economist notes a $3.38 million decrease in total dollars raised per country per week from July 2017 to September 2018, a 17.6 percent reduction in weekly venture deals, and a 39.6 percent decrease in the amount raised per deal. The numbers are associated with between 3,000 and 30,000 job losses.20"Indeed, the GDPR can be examined as a trade barrier to keep small American firms out so that small European firms can get a foothold.21 Even so, the GDPR has also made it difficult for Euro-pean startups. Consider the case of Momio, a social network for children started to offer an al-ternative to Facebook."Momio is an online social network designed and operated exclusively for children age 5-15 with one million users across the Nordic region and Netherlands, Germany, and Poland.22 Launched in 2013, it operates a flagship version and Momio Lite, which does not process any personal data. The Lite version does not allow posting of text or images. Parental consent is required for users under the age of 13. Kids access the platform via a mobile device and interact with ava-tars they individually create. The platform is funded by partnerships with kid-friendly content and media companies. The platform is grounded in concepts of digital life skills with a focus on digital use, safety, security, emotional intelligence, communication, and literacy. As explained in an email by the company's CEO Mikkel Jensen, "...as far as I know, the GDPR legislative work has not involved parents and children in the development of the law when it comes to child protection. GDPR has not made it easier to be a child on digital platforms, but on the contrary, more difficult."23"The GDPR has proved cost prohibitive for many firms. To do business in the EU today, the av-erage firm of 500 employees must spend about $3 million to comply with the GDPR.24 Thou-sands of US firms have decided it is not worthwhile and have exited.25 Of course, $3 million, or even $300 million, is nothing for Google, Facebook, and Amazon (the Fortune 500 firms have reportedly earmarked $8 billion for GDPR upgrades26), but it would bankrupt many online en-terprises in the US. Indeed, less than half of eligible firms are fully compliant with the GDPR; one-fifth say that full compliance is impossible.27 The direct welfare loss is estimated be about Euros260 per European citizen.28 If a similar regulation were enacted in the US, total GDPR compli-ance costs for US firms alone could reach $150 billion, twice what the US spends on broadband network investment29 and one-third of annual e-commerce revenue in the US.30"The GDPR has affected not just American media outlets but also their advertisers. Given the scope of Google's advertising platform and its affiliates on syndicated networks, its compliance with the GDPR has caused ripple effects in ancillary markets. Independent ad exchanges noted prices plummeting 20 to 40 percent.31 Some advertisers report being shut out from exchanges.32 The GDPR's complex and arcane designations for "controllers" and "processors" can ensnare third-party chipmakers, component suppliers, and software vendors that have never interfaced with end users, as European courts have ruled that any part of the internet ecosystem can be liable for data breaches.33"The GDPR has silenced free speech and expression. Since the GDPR went into effect, over 1,000 news sites have gone dark in the EU.34 EU residents have been unable to access Tribune Media, whose flagship newspapers include the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, the Hartford Courant (America's longest running newspaper since 1764), the Orlando Sentinel, and the Baltimore Sun.35 Nor can they access more than 60 newspapers of Lee Enterprises covering news across 20 US states.36 Blocked media is a problem not only for the one million Americans who live in the EU who can no longer read news and information about their hometowns but also for Europeans who wish to learn more about the US from direct sources rather than the state-owned media, which dominate the press and broadcasting in most EU countries."No longer visible in the EU are more than 1,000 American news and media outlets, in addition to many sites for ecommerce, games, information technology, and other services.37 This is concerning because the EU is the destination of about two-thirds of America's exports of digital media, goods, and services.38"GDPR compliance is so costly and cumbersome that these entities self-censor rather than risk violating the GDPR. If the GDPR were adopted in the US, it would likely violate the First Amendment, as the requirements for data processing are so onerous that they would be found to limit expression. A related issue with the GDPR is the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF), the notion that information has a finite life and that after a certain period, the information's life is "spent" and can be deleted from the public domain. The EU asserts that the GDPR applies to data controllers anywhere in the world if they process a European citizen's data. Similarly, RTBF proponents such as France's data protection authority (DPA) attempt to force the global removal of public information in the name of data protection. For example, the French DPA has ordered Google to delete certain search results in France, and it believes that the company must therefore delete them for all countries' search engines. Google has appealed this holding to the European Court of Justice. The European Commission, Ireland, and Greece support the company in its appeal, arguing that RTBF stretches the meaning of data protection too far.39"Indeed, the GDPR's asserted jurisdiction outside the EU may itself be illegal--at least where the US is concerned.40 The GDPR is likely unenforceable under US common law, which rejects foreign rulings when they are contrary to American policy.41 The SPEECH Act, passed in 2010, supplies strong protections for First Amendment freedoms in the context of libel suits brought in foreign jurisdictions.42"The GDPR threatens innovation and research. Many GDPR requirements are fundamentally in-compatible with big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and machine learning, especially those that require data processors to disclose the purpose of data processing, minimize their use of data, and automate decision-making.43 For technology developers, engineers, and entre-preneurs, the GDPR creates uncertainty not only in the text of the law and its adjudication but also in that requirements and tenets of the GDPR conflict with the operation of machine learn-ing and artificial intelligence.44"Some of the most important recent scientific advances have been the result of processing various sets of information in inventive ways--ways that neither subjects nor controllers anticipated, let alone requested. Consider the definitive study on whether using mobile phones causes brain cancer.45 The Danish Cancer Society analyzed 358,403 Danish mobile subscribers by processing Social Security numbers, mobile phone numbers, and the National Cancer Registry, which records every incidence of cancer by Social Security number.46 The study, the most comprehensive investigation of its kind ever conducted, proves that using mobile phones is not correlated with brain cancer. But the users' information was not collected for the express purpose of such a study. Therefore, it is possible that, had the GDPR been in effect at the time of the study, consent from the population whose data was analyzed would not have been available, and the GDPR's purpose-specification requirement would have therefore made it impossible to conduct the study. Going forward, it is possible, if not likely, that valuable research will not be conducted because of the GDPR."Indeed, part of the promise of socialized medicine was the ability to tap the vast pools of data in public health databases to make advances in medicine. However, a privacy panic is threatening to derail some projects,47 including Iceland's genome warehouse, the oldest and most complete genetic record in the world, which promises groundbreaking therapies for Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer.48 While many regulatory advocates focus attention on Silicon Valley firms and call for greater regulation, their campaign is backfiring as users turn their ire toward governments and demand erasure of their data from national health care records and other government services, potentially frustrating the operating models of mandated social programs.49 With the mantra of "if in doubt, opt out," about half a million Australians rejected the country's national electronic health record, causing the computer system to crash in July 2018.50"For centuries, European state churches have collected and published information on births, deaths, weddings, baptisms, and more. In Denmark and Sweden, these institutions retain the official register for this information. Because of the GDPR, many churches have stopped printing announcements in the bulletins for their local congregations unless they obtain consent first.51 GDPR risks have also been identified with respect to convicted felons successfully removing information about their crimes from search engines,52 the exchange of business cards,53 the taking of pictures in public,54 and disclosures of health and injury information in the trade of soccer players.55"The GDPR increases cybersecurity risks. A key unintended consequence of the GDPR is that it undermines the transparency of the international systems and architecture that organize the internet. The WHOIS query and response protocol for internet domain names, IP addresses, and autonomous systems is used by law enforcement, cybersecurity professionals and re-searchers, and trademark and intellectual property rights holders.56 The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) recently announced a Temporary Specification that allows registries and registrars to obscure WHOIS information they were previously required to make public, ostensibly to comply with the GDPR.57 This could hinder efforts to combat unlaw-ful activity online, including identity theft, cyberattacks, online espionage, theft of intellectual property, fraud, unlawful sale of drugs, human trafficking, and other criminal behavior, and it is not even required by the GDPR."The GDPR does not apply at all to nonpersonal information and states that disclosure of even personal information can be warranted for matters such as consumer protection, public safety, law enforcement, enforcement of rights, cybersecurity, and combating fraud. Moreover, the GDPR does not apply to domain names registered to US registrants by American registrars and registries. Nor does it apply to domain name registrants that are companies, businesses, or other legal entities, rather than "natural persons." All the same, actors including ICANN are practicing voluntary censorship because the GDPR's provisions are so vague and the potential penalties so high. GDPR proponents have likely contributed to the impression that the GDPR urges measures such as the Temporary Specification. For example, in her role in the Article 29 Working Party, the group that drove the promulgation of the GDPR, Andrea Jelinek said that the elimination and masking of WHOIS information is justified under the GDPR.58"The WHOIS problem can be described as the conflict between the individual's right to privacy and the public's right to know.59 It can also be understood within the context of the problem of "privacy overreach,"60 in which the drive to protect privacy becomes absolute, lacks balance with other rights, and unwittingly brings worse outcomes for privacy and data protection.61 The situation harkens back to a key fallacy of privacy activists who attempted to block the rollout of caller ID because it violated the privacy rights of intrusive callers. Today, the receiver's right to know who is calling is prioritized over the caller's right to remain anonymous.62 Similarly it is understood that the needs of public safety will supersede data protection, particularly in situations of danger to human life. Moreover, one should expect intellectual property to be in balance with data protection, not in conflict as it is under the GDPR. The pace of development of privacy and data protection law is significantly faster than that of other kinds of law, leading one scholar to suggest that it threatens to upend the balance with other fundamental rights.63 This point is eloquently underscored by Richard Epstein in his critique of the idea of privacy rights established by the Warren Court. This progressive theory assumes that it is "always easy, if not inevitable, to expand the set of rights without adverse social consequences," but it never stops to consider that, when rights are expanded, correlative duties are imposed on others.64"I have noted the security fallout from the GDPR, but there are additional security problems. In their rush to declare moral superiority over the US, European policymakers disregarded the ex-istential threats to privacy by network hardware manufacturers Huawei, ZTE, and Lenovo.65 Eu-ropean authorities, wanting to get networks cheaply, blessed the construction of communica-tions networks with equipment from dubious Chinese vendors. Data-protection standards mean little if affiliates of the Chinese government and military can access our data in the cloud, through backdoors, by hacking, or through other illicit means."Fortunately, the US does not have this problem to the same extent. The US recognized the risk at the outset, understood that security is worth paying for, and limited its exposure to these firms. I applaud the Senate for its leadership on this front.66 I also support the role of cyber in-surance to help firms assess and address security risks.67"The GDPR and the CCPA create risks for identity theft and online fraud. The GDPR and the CCPA purportedly give users the ability to control their data by facilitating user requests. How-ever, they also give hackers and identity thieves the ability to steal data because there is no provision for user authentication. Companies now have to develop data pools to respond to user requests, creating a target-rich environment for cyber criminals. 68 This outcome is indica-tive both of the zeal of policymakers to regulate without thinking through the consequences (let alone consulting users to their preferences) and the general sloppiness of a law stitched to-gether in a mere week, as was the case of the GDPR."The GDPR has not created greater trust online. The GDPR might be justified if it created greater trust in the digital ecosystem, but there is no such evidence. After a decade of GDPR-type regulations--in which users endure intrusive pop-ups and disclosures on every digital property they visit69--Europeans report no greater sense of trust online.70 More than half of survey respondents in the United Kingdom say that they feel no better off since the GDPR took effect and that it has not helped them understand how their data are used.71 As of 2017, only 30 percent of Europeans shop outside their own country (a paltry increase of 10 percent in a decade), demonstrating that the European Commission's Digital Single Market goals are still elusive.72 Similarly, California has more privacy laws than any state, and yet its residents do not report feeling more private or safe."The GDPR and the CCPA use the pretense of consumer control to increase the power of gov-ernment. Control is defined as the power to influence behavior. The European and California rules are a government power grab in the name of giving control to consumers. This can be demonstrated by studying the text of the laws themselves in which the discussion of consumers is mere pretense to the true objective: giving more power to government. The GDPR imposes 45 specific regulations on business practices and regulators with 35 obligations. California goes even further with 77 regulations on business practices and sweeping powers to the attorney general."Indeed, if EU and California provisions were so laudable, why are we not demanding that American government institutions also uphold these standards? Such rules would likely cripple, both logistically and financially, the hundreds of personal data-collection agencies of the federal government and thousands in state and local government. With the mantra of "if in doubt, opt out," about half a million Australians rejected that country's national electronic health record, causing the federal computer system to crash in July 2018 and casting doubt on the underlying economics of the model.73"Many Americans are persuaded by lofty descriptions of the GDPR--contrasting the legislation with what they see as a morally inferior laissez-faire approach at home--both because they confuse data privacy and protection and because they are not familiar with America's own substantive protections. Journalists and commentators glibly refer to the US as the "Wild West," as if there are no laws or regulation on data privacy and protection.74 In fact, there are hundreds of laws relating to privacy and data protection in the US--including common law torts, criminal laws, evidentiary privileges, federal statues, and state laws.75 The EU's laws are relatively new, officially dating from this century, and they still lack the runway of judicial scrutiny and case law that characterizes US law."A popular misconception about the GDPR is that it protects privacy; it does not. In fact, the word "privacy" does not even appear in the final text of the GDPR, except in a footnote.76 Rather, the GDPR is about data protection or, more correctly, data governance.77 Data privacy is about the use of data by people who are allowed to have it. Data protection, on the other hand, refers to technical systems that keep data out of the hands of people who should not have it. By its very name, the GDPR regulates the processing of personal data, not privacy."The American notion of privacy is predicated largely on freedom from government intrusion and as a counterweight to the growth of the administrative state.78 The Bill of Rights' Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments responded to the egregious British abuses of personal privacy, including the quartering of soldiers in private homes, the search and seizure of colonists' property, and forcing colonists to divulge information. Some of the first laws in the new republic were enacted to protect privacy in mail. These were followed by laws constraining the government's use of the census79 and its ability to compel information in court.80 The 1966 Freedom of Information Act ensured that people could access records held by the government. Given this history of pushing back against government intrusion, it is reasonable to be skeptical that increasing government power is now the key to privacy in the US."It is precisely when leaders feel voter confidence slipping that they look for a way to increase power, as such the GDPR is an attempt by European policymakers to solidify legitimacy for Brussels during a period of deep skepticism among voters. The GDPR can be examined in the context of a heightened pro v. anti-EU debate, fueled by a rise in Euroscepticism and nationalist parties which charge that European integration weakens national sovereignty.81 Smarting from a disgruntled electorate and the Brexit bombshell,82 pro-European coalitions support pan-European regulation such as the GDPR to legitimize the EU project. It should be noted that Eurosceptic political actors are not necessarily opposed to data protection regulation; they merely prefer the primacy of national institutions over European ones, largely because of concerns that EU institutions and policies are subverting democracy."In the case of the GDPR, there was no groundswell of public support calling for the enactment of greater data protection regulation. The GDPR was enacted during a period of voter "disengagement."83 Participation in European Parliament elections has dwindled from 62 percent in 1979 to just 42 percent in 2014.84 This environment of voter disengagement is conducive for the collective action of organized special interests to defeat a diffuse, disgruntled, and unorganized majority.85 Relatively few Europeans are even aware of the GDPR. For example, a United Kingdom survey found that only 34 percent of respondents recognized the law, and even fewer knew what it covered.86 Essentially, a relatively small group of GDPR advocates successfully implemented massive pan-European regulation without significant voter buy-in. Public opinion as measured by the Eurobarometer poll87 suggests that most people would prefer a more nuanced approach to data protection over the sledgehammer of the GDPR, and that most would rather strengthen regulation at the nation-state level than at the EU.88"It does not appear that consumers are so empowered by the GDPR as litigants and non-profit organizations which the GDPR empowers with new rights to organize class actions,89 lodge complaints,90 and receive compensation91 from fines levied on firms' annual revenue, as high as four percent of annual revenue.92 Historically, Europe has largely eschewed "U.S.-style" class actions,93 noting that they disproportionately reward lawyers and litigation financiers over consumers.94 But policymakers have engineered the GDPR so that privacy activists can bring cases without overcoming legal barriers of standing and jurisdiction, which are traditional safeguards against the abuse of the legal system for private gain. A mere 7 hours after the GDPR was implemented, complaints requesting over $8 billion in damages and compensation had already been filed by professional litigants who helped craft the law.95"The GDPR and the CCPA fail to meaningfully incorporate the role of privacy enhancing innova-tion and consumer education in data protection. Without meaningful provisions to promote education or innovation, the GDPR and CCPA freeze the status quo in place, rewarding the larg-est players; punish small- and medium-sized enterprises; and trick people into thinking that they have more privacy when in fact they are being put at greater risk."Bureaucratizing data protection does not create a natural right of privacy. Having ever more regulators and regulations to govern data does not make a person safer. Regulation freezes the status quo; it does not support the improvement of systems or user knowledge. Moreover, the EU and California rules disintermediate the vital connection between the user and online provider which provides feedback to help the platform evolve."We have discussed the 10 problems. Now let's discuss policy elements which have been evidenced to provide superior outcomes than we have experienced with the GDPR: privacy enhancing technologies, consumer education, and standard setting."The California and European rules miss two of the four essential evidenced elements to create trust online. Neither policy incorporates the role of privacy enhancing technologies to improve the online system or the role of knowledge to help upgrade users' competence.The Role of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) in Promoting Online Privacy"Privacy regulation attempts to shape the market to deliver predetermined outcomes and re-quires government intervention to certify compliance. Innovation, on the other hand, can cre-ate better systems that never compromise a user's privacy. Extensive evidence shows that a flexible, innovation-based approach yields software and systems that are better designed to protect data and privacy and that empower enterprises to operate with data protection as a competitive parameters.96 The International Association of Privacy Professionals' survey of pri-vacy practices of 800 enterprises around the world found that traditionally less-regulated indus-tries have more advanced privacy practices than highly regulated industries, which conform only to regulatory requirements.97 Even in 2010, the International Conference of Data Protec-tion and Privacy Commissioners resolved that efforts to promote privacy by design needed to be more deeply embedded in policy.98"The problem with regulating software technology is that it freezes a status quo instead of sup-porting the innovation that can lead to better, more consumer-centric systems. Indeed, the GDPR mandate of a single mode of data governance unwittingly creates an attack surface for cyber criminals. As such, we should encourage multi-stakeholder efforts of the National Tele-communications and Information Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Tech-nology, and others to develop a scientific, evidence-based framework as the most salient ap-proach to privacy and data protection in the 21st century. The focus on the scientific approach ensures the engineering trustworthiness of technology. Measurement science and system engi-neering principles can support the creation of frameworks, risk models, tools, and standards that protect privacy and civil liberties.99"The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security's (ENISA) related report "Pri-vacy and Data Protection by Design" explains privacy-enhancing technologies including not only encryption but also protocols for anonymous communications, attribute-based credentials, and private search of databases in addition to a range of strategies of multiple practices that firms can employ.100 It describes a large body of literature on privacy by design but also states that its implementation is weak and scattered. Indeed, privacy and data protection features are rela-tively new issues for engineers, designers, and product developers when implementing the de-sired functionality. To address this, ENISA has stewarded the discussion on how to develop a repository of such technologies."Upon introduction, new technologies such as the camera, transistors, and RFID chips creeped people out, but these technologies have tremendously benefited our society. This privacy panic cycle of trust, panic, deflation, and acceptance is well-documented for more than a century.101 When asked which has most improved life in the past 50 years, Americans note technology more than four times as often as medicine, civil rights, or the economy.102"If anything, the policy should promote firms to use data. Indeed, the trouble with today's econ-omy is not that there is too much use of data, but too little. A lack of "information intensity" is holding back the so-called other 70 percent of American economy sectors, such as transporta-tion and health care, the latter of which consumes almost one-fifth of gross domestic prod-uct.103 Outside of certain applications, the traditional health care industry is woefully inefficient; digital industries are eight times more productive and innovative. If the US does not innovate these other sectors, other nations will beat us to it. China is already on track with an "Internet Plus" policy, which supports the digitization of industries, including health care and govern-ment.104"Some of America's greatest resources are intellectual capital and creative ingenuity. We should build on our technology prowess to create world-class, scientifically superior privacy design. There are hundreds of privacy-enhancing technologies.105 No one technology is best for all com-panies, and, in practice, companies use a mix of technologies. Congress should incentivize the development of such technologies through grants and competitions and provide safe harbors for their research, development, and practice."I commend the work by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to inform this ef-fort.106 Moreover, the FTC's budget and authority should be expanded to accommodate the needed economists, technologists, and other professionals to enforce privacy protections. Pres-ently, the FTC has a mere 80 economists and 800 attorneys. The consumer-protection function of the FTC should be strengthened by aggregating the consumer protection resources now frit-tered across a series of federal agencies and consolidating them under one roof at the FTC.107Consumer Control Requires Consumer Education"Consumer education is an important but fragmented field. It plays a role to help people con-sumer products and services safely and intelligently, like heath education and financial literacy. We need the same kind of training for our online lives."It is instructive to consider the robust, vibrant market for information and education in the con-sumer electronics field, detailing the most minute and technical aspect of machines. For dec-ades consumers have availed themselves to magazines, online discussions, rankings, reviews, how-to videos, and conferences on how to use these technologies, yet there is no policymaker directing the discussion; it grows by consumer demand."There is no reason why there could not be similar resources for privacy education. There is a public policy role to support education in this space, including working with industry to dissemi-nate the important information and challenge them to ensure their users take privacy trainings and tutorials. See p. 12 of my testimony to the FTC in which I describe how the FTC's existing privacy education resources can be leveraged, examples of curricula, and education distribution models.108The US Can Leapfrog the GDPR and the CCPA with Technology-Based Standards for Data Pro-tection"Policy should support the innovation of new and better privacy-enhancing technology. We can learn from the standard setting process undertaken at the FTC with COPPA. I applaud the work of Pam Dixon of the World Privacy Forum who has provided extensive analysis and documenta-tion to the value of standard setting.109 I quote liberally:""Much has been learned in the last 25 years about data protection and digital identity ecosystems. . . . However, baseline digital ecosystem governance principles are gener-ally not as well-understood or known outside of certain contexts where they are often found in use, such as environmental, production, and law enforcement contexts."Nobel Laureate and economist Elinor Ostrom spent her entire career observing and ana-lyzing governance of complex ecosystems, particularly the commons, or shared re-sources. Over the span of decades, she observed and distilled the most effective ways of managing complex ecosystems where stakeholders share resources ("common pool" re-sources). Identity--particularly digital identity--is one such common pool resource."In complex digital ecosystems, strict top-down ownership is a difficult position to up-hold, as is demand for full individual control of data. However, mutually agreed govern-ance of resources that are shared can work, and has proven to work. If we think of data--and identity data--as a shared resource, one in which multiple stakeholders have involvement with and an interest in, then we have a pathway to govern those systems as shared resource systems. . . ."Ostrom set forth eight principles for governance of complex systems using shared re-sources. . . . They can also be applied in complex data and identity ecosystems where frameworks such as FIPs provide baseline principles to apply and implement. The Ostrom general principles are as follows:1. Rules are devised and managed by resource users.2. Compliance with rules is easy to monitor.3. Rules are enforceable.4. Sanctions are graduated.5. Adjudication is available at low cost.6. Monitors and other officials are accountable to users.7. Institutions to regulate a given common-pool resource may need to be devised at multiple levels.""The most striking difference between these recommendations and the GDPR and CCPA is that the users, not regulators, write the rules. Compliance is easy to monitor and not financially crushing to service providers. Monitors are accountable to users. The CCPA does not require any accountability to the California Attorney General. There are no transparency obligation or other valuable measures to ensure accountability.How Common Standards Ensure Equal Privacy Protections for All Americans"The GDPR was created to bring a single standard of data protection to the EU. If each US state makes its own rules, we will become the Balkanized Europe, which the GDPR sought to remedy. The idea of a single national market is central to America's founding and was espoused by James Madison and Alexander Hamilton.110 This framework was essential for our country to launch and commercialize the internet economy, and today the US accounts for one-third of the world's internet economy.111 In the process of adjudication of privacy violations, it is not fair that residents of some states get payouts while others do not. America's internet compa-nies are national, if not global, so enforcement must proceed federally from the FTC to ensure fairness. Importantly, Congress should adopt safeguards against rent-seeking by self-interested actors to abuse consumer protection laws to enrich themselves through litigation."Ideally we need a technologically neutral national framework with a consistent application across enterprises. It should support consumers' expectations to have same protections on all online entities.112. Unlike the GDPR, the US policy should not make it more expensive to do business, reduce consumer freedom, or inhibit innovation."I humbly submit that Congress review the empirical research on privacy and data protection that the Europeans ignored, notably the process for innovation in privacy-enhancing technolo-gies and the primacy of user knowledge as a component of online trust.113 The US does not need to copy the European Union on data protection. It can fundamentally improve on the GDPR by making a policy that actually works--promoting privacy without destroying prosperity, empowering people to make informed decisions, and ensuring innovators the freedom to in-vent and improve privacy-enhancing technology."* * *Footnotes:1 Roslyn Layton, "How the GDRP Compares to Best Practices for Privacy, Accountability and Trust," March 31, 2017, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2944358.2 Mark Scott, Laurens Cerulus, and Laura Kayali, "Six Months in, Europe's Privacy Revolution Favors Google, Face-book," Politico, November 27, 2018, https://www.politico.eu/article/gdpr-facebook-google-privacy-data-6-months-in-europes-privacy-revolution-favors-google-facebook/.https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-europes-new-privacy-rules-favor-google-and-facebook-1524536324https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-07-20/google-s-mortal-enemy-does-it-a-95-billion-favorhttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-06-25/google-and-facebook-turn-on-the-fake-riviera-charm3 Campbell, James, Avi Goldfarb, and Catherine Tucker.

Huawei founder breaks silence to deny espionage chargesFierceWirelessJanuary 15, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 403 wordsByline: Matt KapkoHighlight: The CEO and founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, hasn't spoken with foreign media since 2015, but he has broken his silence to vehemently deny charges of espionage that continue to weigh on the Chinese company, Bloomberg reports. During a sit-down with foreign media at Huawei's headquarters, Ren said the company has no regular contact with the Chinese government and denied all charges of spying.\rBodyThe CEO and founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, hasn't spoken with foreign media since 2015, but he has broken his silence to vehemently deny charges of espionage that continue to weigh on the Chinese company, Bloomberg reports. During a gathering with foreign media at Huawei's headquarters, Ren said the company has no regular contact with the Chinese government and denied all charges of spying.“I love my country, I support the Communist Party. But I will not do anything to harm the world,” Ren said, according to Bloomberg. “I don't see a close connection between my personal political beliefs and the businesses of Huawei.”The forceful denial from the reclusive billionaire highlights the precarious position the company is in after multiple incidents and arrests have reinforced widening fears about the company's operations. Ren's daughter Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada last month upon request from U.S. officials for allegedly using the global banking system to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran. And last week, a director of sales for Huawei was arrested in Poland for allegedly spying on behalf of China. Ren declined to comment in detail about his daughter's arrest.RELATED:Huawei sales director arrested in Poland on espionage chargesRen told journalists that he would decline any request from the Chinese government for sensitive information on Huawei's customers, and said neither he nor the company has ever fielded such a request. Amid heightened tensions and controversies that are stretching across the globe, Ren said he was confident the company's revenue would grow to $125 billion this year. “If they don't want Huawei to be in some markets, we can scale down a bit. As long as we can survive and feed our employees, there's a future for us,” he said, according to Bloomberg.Ren also made a positive and calculated statement intended to catch the attention of President Donald Trump, calling him “a great president.” Trump is reportedly considering an executive order that would bar U.S. companies from using equipment made by Huawei and ZTE. He also likely has at least some sway over the ongoing detention of Meng in Canada.RELATED:Huawei enters 2019 with high expectations, daunting challenges in the U.S.“When it comes to cybersecurity and privacy protection we are committed to be sided with our customers,” he said, according to CNBC. “We will never harm any nation or any individual.”Load-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

Survey: China factory activity sinks to 3-year lowAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 28, 2019 Thursday 4:34 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 365 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Chinese manufacturing activity fell to a three-year low in February amid a tariff battle with Washington and weak global demand, a survey showed Thursday.The monthly purchasing managers' index by the government statistics bureau and an industry group fell 0.3 points to 49.2 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 indicate activity contracting. That was the lowest level since February 2016.Chinese manufacturers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's punitive tariffs in a fight over Beijing's technology plans and cooling consumer demand at home and abroad.Trump said weekend talks in Washington made progress but companies are wary of making investments and other long-term decisions without a formal settlement."Unless the trade war truly turns into an extended truce, the weakening trend may not end quickly," Irene Pang of ING said in a report.Any deal is unlikely until at least the end of March, so "another month or two of bad PMI data" are likely, she said.Measures of output and employment declined, according to the National Bureau of Statistics and the Federation of Logistics & Purchasing.The weakness in trade and manufacturing has increased pressure on the ruling Communist Party to resolve its fight with Washington.Last year's economic growth declined to a three-decade low of 6.6 percent and Thursday's report adds to signs activity might be weakening further.Trump is pressing Beijing to roll back plans for state-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technology that Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say violate China's market-opening obligations.China's global exports rebounded in January from a contraction but sales to the United States fell 2.4 percent from a year earlier, reflecting the impact of Trump's tariff hikes.The trade battle and has rattled Chinese consumers, some of whom say they are putting off big purchases until the economic outlook is clearer. That sets back Beijing's campaign to nurture self-sustaining economic growth based on domestic consumption instead of exports and investment.The government has warned Chinese exporters the global environment is "complicated and severe."Load-Date: February 28, 2019End of Document

Build those nice big plants that stretch for miles. in the US '", assured Trump.  "China is the biggest beneficiary of Apple, more than we are," the president riveted in a new episode of the trade war his administration has with the Chinese government.  Trump said he was not worried about Apple's recent falls in the stock market as a result of the revision of sales expectations and assured that the company's value in the markets has risen sharply since he assumed the presidency.  It is foreseen that the company of the bitten apple will publish the final results (corresponding to the months of October, November and December of 2018 but which constitute its first fiscal quarter of 2019) at the beginning of February. Load-Date: January 7, 2019End of Document

Ambassador Lin said that Huawei is not only a major participant but also an important contributor to China-Africa cooperation in the field of science and technology. The communication and information technology products provided and network infrastructure financed and built by Huawei can be found everywhere in African countries. Huawei has become the world's largest network equipment supplier and the leading supplier of global 5G network technology. It has provided and will be providing public goods to promote the rapid economic and social development in Africa and the rest of the world, facilitating them deeply integrated into the process of globalization.Ambassador Lin said that frightened by Huawei's leading position in 5G network technology, and out of self-interest to maintain the so called "America First", the United States abuses its hegemony and the reference of its domestic laws to take "long-arm jurisdiction" over Huawei and even instigated the kidnap of Huawei's executive on unwarranted charges, which is not only a serious violation of the rule of law and the spirit of Contract advocated by the Americans themselves, but also immoral in every means. It will thus cut off the global value chain and supply chain, and seriously undermine and distort the international market order of fair competition.Ambassador Lin said that Huawei's patents from its leading 5G network technology innovation, belong to China, but will be shared by all mankind. Huawei will provide the most advanced and affordable technology support to all countries around the world to embrace and adapt themselves to the Fourth Industrial Revolution with the main characteristics of the internet technology, big data, artificial intelligence and shared economy. On the African continent, Huawei has been the main supplier of communication equipment, while European companies mainly from UK and France are the most important communication operators and beneficiaries. If Europe follows the suit of the US, Huawei will inevitably be hurt, and in result Europe has to pay a heavy price for its tech hysteresis .Ambassador Lin stressed that blanket ban on Huawei by the US with the excuse of national security is groundless, out of common sense and illogical. The US led the Third Industrial Revolution with the invention of computers. Since then, the American have grasped the core technology of computer chips with the ability to open the "back door". But China and the rest of the world are not frightened to use US computers because we believe that Business Is Business. The US companies dare not to abuse its privilege. As computers become widely used and more suppliers joining in the market, should US willfully open the "back door",will it lose consumers confidence, its market share and eventually be out of game. Likewise, even if Huawei had the technology and the privilege, will it take a risk to do the things that the US dare not to try? The Chinese government has always encouraged Chinese companies to operate overseas in accordance with local laws and regulations, and has never had any bad record of requesting any Chinese companies to be involved with activities either against local laws or business ethics. The malice of the US is unraveled.Ambassador Lin emphasized that JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL. We are glad to see that more and more western governments, media and people have spoken out rational and just words on the Huawei issue. According to a recent CNN public opinion poll, 61 percent of Americans believe the U.S. government's ban on Huawei is politically motivated. The Financial Times and other media in the UK, France, Germany and Italy have distanced themselves from the US in their reports and comments. It is China's hope and belief that Europe could have a clear understanding of the situations and make the right judgment and decision on the issue so as to avoid harming others without benefiting itself.Load-Date: February 27, 2019End of Document

FIVE FACTS ON THE RACE TO CONTROL 5G NETWORKSStates News ServiceFebruary 26, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 836 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by No Labels:In the coming century, many of the most dangerous national security threats will stem from cyber-attacks. The United States and China are currently engaged in a race to corner the nascent 5G network industry, one of the most important factors in the brewing technological battlefield. Here are five facts on the race to control 5G networks.5G refers to the fifth generation of telecommunication networks and is expected to revolutionize technologies ranging from smartphones to robotic medicine.According to CNN Business, 5G is primarily about three things: Faster speeds, faster connections and faster access to the cloud. This means that your smartphone's network connection could become 100 times faster than what is currently available on the 4G network, allowing you to download a 3-D movie in three seconds, as opposed to six minutes; but it also carries important significance in areas such as transportation and medicine. The faster speeds will allow self-driving cars to process all the information needed to make split-second decisions, and will usher in the next generation of robotic surgery, which requires robots to interact with their networks with zero lag time.There is a global race to lead the transition to 5G.The United States and China are currently engaged in a high-stakes competition for technological superiority in the 21st century, and 5G is sure to play an integral role. The struggle for superiority has also pitted major American telecommunications companies, such as Verizon, ATandT, Sprint, and T-Mobile, against Chinese companies such as Huawei. The implications range from capitalizing on what is likely to be one of the most lucrative industries in the coming decades, as more and more devices, such as home appliances and cars, are connected to the internet, to which country controls highly sensitive communication networks around the world.Thus far, China and Huawei have out competed their American counterparts.Huawei is the second largest smartphone maker behind Samsung and is the global leader when it comes to telecom equipment, the hardware found in cell towers and internet networks that will be required to implement 5G throughout the world. According to Jaroslav Roman, a Czech Communist Party official familiar with Huawei's importance due to the company's massive influence in the Czech Republic, "the Chinese believe they are one to two years ahead of everyone," when it comes to implementing 5G, and have been working to cement their advantage in countries throughout the world. According to a report compiled by the consultancy company Deloitte, China has outspent the U.S. on 5G related investments by $24 billion since 2015 and has built 350,000 new cell towers, while the U.S. has built just 30,000.Vice President Mike Pence has led the effort to curb Chinese influence in the 5G revolution and give American companies an edge.The United States is deeply concerned about Huawei's potential influence. Much of this apprehension stems from a Chinese law that requires organizations and citizens to cooperate in intelligence gathering on behalf of the state. So, if a network is controlled by Huawei, it is entirely possible the Chinese government could have access to any information shared over that network. This becomes increasingly dangerous if Huawei, for example, set up the telecommunications network for a country's government, as it could open the door to high-level security breaches. Top American officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, have spoken out forcefully against Huawei. In a recent speech delivered in Munich, Pence warned that "Chinese law requires them to provide Beijing's vast security apparatus with access to any data that touches their networks or equipment," adding, "the United States is calling on all our security partners to be vigilant and to reject any enterprise that would compromise the integrity of our communications technology or national security systems."It remains unclear if America's allies will follow its lead in boycotting Huawei.While Huawei has been essentially shut out of all U.S. markets after a 2012 congressional report designated the company as a national-security threat, it has continued to expand aggressively in key western European countries, such as the U.K., Germany, and France. In a recent blow, the French Senate rejected proposed legislation designed to toughen regulation on telecoms equipment, stressing that lawmakers had not had enough time to review the provision. While the idea of increased regulation enjoys the support of French President Emmanuel Macron, the initial defeat means it will likely take months before a similar bill can be voted on again. In Germany, a recent probe by the country's cybersecurity agency showed that Huawei could not use its equipment to spy on German communications, and the U.K. intelligence service reportedly has concluded that it could effectively limit the risk of using Huawei's technology.Load-Date: February 27, 2019End of Document

Funding universities is a national security issueThe McGill Tribune: McGill UniversityFebruary 19, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 639 wordsBodyWhile the Chinese telecommunications manufacturer Huawei may be most famous in Canada for the Vancouver arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the company's influence is much closer to McGill than that event might suggest.  Despite security experts' concerns that the company may be operating as an intelligence asset for the Chinese government, Canadian universities, including McGill, have accepted roughly $50 million in total from Huawei to fund research and development initiatives. It would be easy to dismiss accepting these 'gifts' as irresponsible; however, increasingly-tight budgets have made it difficult for universities to do anything else. Simply barring universities from accepting Huawei's money is not a sufficient response to the risk of foreign espionage. Governments need to ensure that universities are financially viable in the long term, whether through increasing direct funding or partnering with more reputable members of the private sector.Security experts from around the world, including former Canadian Security and Intelligence Service director Ward Elcock, have expressed concerns that Huawei's products-which range from smartphones to large-scale network infrastructure-include deliberate security backdoors to assist the Chinese government in spying on their users. For instance, security vulnerabilities in Huawei cell towers might allow Chinese intelligence agents to intercept political or economic information sent over the company's network. The head of the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service and the U.S. House Intelligence Committee have described Huawei as a national security threat, and Germany may be following their lead.This concern extends to Huawei's funding of universities. The company has dedicated $50 million to funding research at Canadian universities, including McGill. In December, CSIS briefed approximately 20 McGill researchers who received funding from Huawei, warning them that they were producing 'dual-use technology' that could be appropriated for military purposes.Technology espionage is more than a hypothetical concern. McGill associate professor Ishiang Shih was arrested in Jan. 2018 on suspicions that he was aiding an effort to leak U.S. military technology to China. Nortel, a Canadian telecommunications company, disbanded in 2013 after being undercut by Huawei using allegedly-stolen technology, costing the Canadian economy tens of thousands of jobs.Despite the potential threat posed by Huawei, Canadian universities continue to partner with the company because they need the funding.  As the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world, few companies can compete dollar-for-dollar with Huawei. This poses a dilemma for researchers: Refusing Huawei's money could spell the end of their project, but, by accepting it, they put themselves in the difficult position of relying on an organization with possible ulterior motives. This applies at the institutional level, too. Canadian universities are strapped for cash: McGill is chronically underfunded by the province, while, in Ontario, universities just lost $360 million to Doug Ford's tuition cut. Extra money-regardless of its source-is difficult to turn down.The best way to limit Huawei's influence over Canadian universities is to crowd out their money. The more alternative funding sources that exist for researchers and universities, the less leverage Huawei has. More government funding for our universities may be necessary. When the status quo involves risking decades of technological vulnerability, it is clear that funding universities isn't just a social good; it is crucial to national security.Share this:• Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)• Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)• Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)RelatedLoad-Date: February 19, 2019End of Document

Global EV Demand Drives Scramble for Fresh Supplies of Vital MetalsPR NewswireJanuary 9, 2019 Wednesday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2509 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, January 9, 2019 BodyPR NewswireNetworkNewsWire Editorial Coverage With global electric vehicle (EV) demand growth creating the potential for tight supplies in battery metals such as cobalt, multinational companies and industrialized nations are working to secure these critical metals as prices are projected to rise.The growing market for electric vehicles has led to much higher demand for battery metals such as cobalt, lithium and nickel.As the largest producer of EVs and largest consumer of battery metals in the world, China is aggressively looking to secure additional supplies of these critical minerals.Savvy companies are looking to lock in long-term supplies of battery metals.Driven by the technological advances and environmentally friendly advantages offered by electric vehicles, the long-awaited EV revolution seems to be taking hold. Numerous global corporations are competing for access to limited supplies of battery metals. Prospective cobalt producerPacific Rim Cobalt Corp.(OTC:PCRCF) (CSE:BOLT)(PCRCF Profile), which just released adetailed corporate update, looks to be in an ideal position to supply those corporations with cobalt. Major miners such asBHP Group Limited American Depositary Shares(NYSE:BHP),Freeport-McMoRan Inc.(NYSE:FCX) andVALE S.A. American DepositaryShares(NYSE:VALE) could play a role in growing the global supply of nickel, cobalt and lithium.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) took the extraordinary step of looking for direct supplies of cobalt last year, which shows how heated the battery metals market has become.To view an infographic of this editorial,click here.EVs Challengethe Global Supply Chain, Drive Innovation The rise in EV popularity has created a rush to buy and create new supplies of battery metals because, unlike a normal auto, EVs require large amounts of nickel, cobalt and lithium. Investment bankGoldman Sachs predictsthat sales of batteries to power EVs will rise from under $10 billion to $60 billion by 2030, which will require that the global availability of battery metals expands to meet swelling demand.In addition to creating new demand for battery metals, EVs are also challenging nations to compete in order to expand battery-producing capacity. Chinese, Japanese and South Korean companies are allworkingto build-out their battery production infrastructure at a rapid pace. China's BYD Auto. Company is currently one of the largest producers of both EVs and batteries for EVs. The company plans to expand its battery manufacturing capacity to 60 gigawatt hours by 2020, nearly half of China's total battery manufacturing capacity in 2017.BYD is part of the Chinese government's plan to become a world leader in EV production. Beijing has spent billions of dollars to support the EV industry over the last decade. According to Chinese research company Gaogong Industry Research Institute, Chinese battery makers heldseven of the top 10 slotson the list of the world's largest suppliers of lithium-ion batteries for EVs last year. BYD ranked third globally, and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL) ranked as the world's top EV battery manufacturer. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that China will produce 70 percent of the world's electric-vehicle batteries by 2021.ChinaIsn't Alone in the Battery Build-Out China wasn't the first country to build large-scale battery manufacturing facilities for EVs. Both Japan and South Korea have extensive battery fabrication operations, and major companies in both nations plan to expand their capacity over the next decade. According to JATO Dynamics, only668,000 battery-powered cars were sold worldwidein 2017,  but year-over-year growth was strong at 78 percent. Roughly 82 million passenger cars were sold in the same year, which offers some idea of the potential market size for EVs.There is neither a lack of government support nor a lack of demand for EVs. One of the only areas where EV growth could face problems may be the supply of battery metals such as nickel, lithium and especially cobalt. Until recently, cobalt was a by-product metal and hadn't been mined as a primary mine product since the World War II. In addition, currently, more than 60 percent of the world's cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Not only is the DRC difficult from a labor-rights perspective, the country also has a long history of violence and an inconsistent record ofshippingmineral resources.Battery producers located in Asia are eager to secure access to cobalt supplies outside of Southern Africa.Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. (OTCQB:PCRCF) (CSE:BOLT)is in a unique position to support these battery producers grow their operations. The company controls the Cyclops Nickel-Cobalt Project in Indonesia, which is in proximity to all three major battery-producing nations.As an initial step in that direction, Pacific Rim recentlysigneda preliminary offtake agreement with Beijing Easpring Material Technology, recognized as an industry leader in China, to purchase nickel sulphate and cobalt sulphate from the company's Cyclops project for an initial term of five years. Indonesia's record on allowing the development of large-scale mines is strong, and the Cyclops Nickel-Cobalt Project is closer to Asian ports than either Africa or Australia, boding well for the success of this venture.Occupying a Unique Position Asian battery producers have limited options when it comes to sourcing essential metals regionally. Pacific Rim Cobalt's Cyclops Nickel-Cobalt Project occupies a unique location, which iswithin4,500 km of accessible ports in Shenzhen, Seoul and Tokyo. The 5,000-hectare property also benefits from excellent local infrastructure allowing for year-round access, with an airport and city nearby. The project is a relatively new development, unlike many cobalt projects in the West, which have been mined-out sporadically over the last century.In addition, further exploration work at Cyclops is planned. After the company's exploration results from a mini-bulk sample were announce last year, Pacific Rim Cobalt CEO Ranjeet Sundhercommentedthat "we expect the near-surface nature of cobalt/nickel mineralization at the Cyclops project will lend itself well to low-cost, logistically straightforward drilling. We thus anticipate the opportunity to undertake a resource calculation study, as well as ongoing metallurgy and process option testing, will present itself in the near future. It's going to be a busy year ahead, and we look forward to getting the drills turning and building value."Pacific Rim Cobalt's Cyclops Nickel-Cobalt Project has returned positive initial sampling results. Further exploration work may help the company delineate a resource and build its way towards a definitive resource estimate. There appears to be no shortage of demand for battery metals, and the Cyclops Project is well placed to potentially service nearby battery-producing companies.A Global Drive for Vital Resources Pacific Rim Cobalt is exploring for cobalt in a jurisdiction that has produced some of the biggest mines in human history.Freeport-McMoRan(NYSE:FCX) developed the Grasberg mine in Indonesia. It is the world's largest gold mine and second-largest producer of copper. The mine operates in the remote highlands of the Sudirman Mountain Range in the Papua province, located on the western half of New Guinea. Freeport-McMoRan and its predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in the area since 1967.Major miners such asBHP Group Limited American Depositary Shares(NYSE:BHP) andVALE S.A. American Depositary Shares(NYSE:VALE) are also looking for ways to leverage the growth in demand for battery metals. BHP is a world-leading resources company that extracts and processes minerals, oil and gas. The company is headquartered in Australia but sells its products worldwide. BHPannouncedlast year that it would be trying to sell as much as 90 percent of the output from its Australian Nickel West operations to the battery sector.With its primary focus on mining, Vale is expanding production at its Voisey's Bay nickel mine in Canada, and the cobalt produced there is already under contract to waiting buyers,includingWheaton Precious Metals Corporation. The company is the world's largest iron ore and nickel producer, with operations in other mineral sectors as well. VALE invests in research studies around the world to identify new mineral reserves, and its teams of geologists and engineers use techniques ranging from  rock-sample collection and subsoil drilling to satellite image analysis to identify the presence of minerals.Despite production expansions by major miners, companies such asApple(NASDAQ:AAPL) that rely heavily on batteries will becompetingagainst the EV industry to buy these essential materials. Cobalt is a critical ingredient in the tech giant's core product line, including iPhones, iPads, Apple Watch and MacBooks. Recognizing the growing demand for the mineral used in its lithium-ion batteries, Apple may benegotiating directly with minersto secure acquisition of the precious metal annually for at least the next five years.For more information about Pacific Rim Cobalt, please visitPacific Rim Cobalt (OTCQB:PCRCF) (CSE:BOLT).About NetworkNewsWire NetworkNewsWire (NNW) is a financial news and content distribution company that provides (1) access to a network of wire services viaNetworkWire to reach all target markets, industries and demographics in the most effective manner possible, (2) article and editorial syndication to 5,000+ news outlets (3), enhanced press release services to ensure maximum impact, (4) social media distribution via the Investor Brand Network (IBN) to nearly 2 million followers, (5) a full array of corporate communications solutions, and (6) a total news coverage solution withNNW Prime.

Kudlow "says Xi Jinping wants everything agreed to before meeting with Trump" because "he's afraid Trump might not like it and walk away."Cohn Says Trump Is "Desperate" For China Trade Deal He Can Pitch As A "Big Win."Bloomberg (3/14, 4.73M) reports that former NEC Director Gary Cohn says the Trump Administration is "desperate right now" for a trade deal with China because "the President needs a win." Bloomberg says Cohn made the comments during "an interview with the Freakonomics podcast." Cohn is quoted as saying, "The only big open issue right now that he could claim as a big win that he'd hope would have a big impact on the stock market would be a Chinese resolution." According to Bloomberg, Cohn also said he has a "very amicable relationship" with President Trump and has talked with Trump "about the economy and personnel since he left the White House in March 2018."Trump-Xi Meeting Unlikely To Happen Before End Of April.Bloomberg (3/14, 4.73M), citing "three people familiar with the matter," reports that President Trump's anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping where they will "sign an agreement to end their trade war" will not "occur this month and is more likely to happen in April at the earliest." According to Bloomberg, "Despite claims of progress in talks by both sides, a hoped-for summit at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort will now take place at the end of April if it happens at all." Bloomberg says Chinese officials are "pressing for a formal state visit, which traditionally takes place in Washington, rather than a lower-key appearance just to sign a trade deal."China Makes Changes To Proposed Foreign-Investment Law.The Wall Street Journal (3/14, Wei, Deng, Subscription Publication, 7.24M) reports China, in an effort to address US concerns about forced technology transfer and shore up a compromise viewed as essential to reaching a trade deal with the US, has made last-minute changes to a proposed foreign-investment law.NYTimes Analysis: Chinese Economic Slowdown May Be Worse Than Official Data Show.According to the New York Times (3/14, Stevenson, Li, 17.76M), "China's slowdown, which has idled factories and construction sites, is rippling through its offices" as "educated, white-collar workers are getting hit with job cuts and shrinking paychecks." According to the Times, "The white-collar job distress suggests the slowdown in China's economy, the world's second largest, is broader than official numbers indicate," and that the Chinese government "will have a harder time pulling the economy out of its slump." The Times says "China's policy tools to kick-start growth - unleashing waves of loans from the state-controlled banking system or building new highways and airports - will not be much help for workers who process insurance claims or enter data into computer systems."Load-Date: March 15, 2019End of Document

As US pushes to ban Huawei, UK considers softer approachAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 21, 2019 Thursday 1:53 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 899 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WriterDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - Britain can handle the security risks involved with using mobile networks made by China's Huawei, the cybersecurity chief said Wednesday, adding to a growing debate among countries on whether the company should be banned, as the U.S. wants.Ciaran Martin, the CEO of the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre, said it was important to have "sustainable diversity" in the supply of telecommunications equipment. He added that his agency could handle the challenges involved in monitoring suppliers who may not be considered trustworthy - a hint at Huawei.Huawei, the world's biggest maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, has faced rising scrutiny over U.S. allegations that it could be forced by the Chinese government to provide access to consumer data on its networks.As countries roll out new high speed fifth generation, or 5G, mobile networks, they are seeking suppliers and the issue of whether to ban Huawei has become a heated debate.Some frame it as a cold evaluation of the technical risks. Others see it as part of a broader tussle between the U.S. and China for technological dominance. The U.S. has effectively blocked Huawei for years and is accusing China of stealing technology from foreign companies.U.S. government officials including Vice President Mike Pence publicly warned European allies against using Huawei during a visit last week.Authorities and telecom operators in countries such as Germany, Norway and the Czech Republic have been reassessing Huawei's role in 5G networks while Australia, New Zealand and Japan have already moved to curb the use of its gear to varying degrees.China has stridently defended Huawei, considered a crown jewel in its push to become a global technology power, and denounced security concerns as part of a U.S.-led plot to restrain the country's development."The United States and a few of its allies are using double standards and deliberately misleading the public on the issue," Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday."It's hypocritical, immoral and unfair bullying behaviors," said Geng.Experts say Huawei networks are generally cheaper than those of competitors and are of a high quality, making it a difficult decision for governments and telecom operators to shun the supplier altogether. Banning Huawei could also delay the rollout of 5G networks, which are considered necessary for the next generation of internet-connected things, from self-driving cars to smart factories.The British government is due to complete a review of its policies on the safety of 5G in March or April.Martin said no decisions have yet been made and "everything is on the table."Since 2010, the British government has operated a cybersecurity evaluation center for Huawei equipment, which Martin said was part of "the toughest and most rigorous oversight regime in the world" for the company."And it is proving its worth," he said, according to a transcript of a speech he gave at a conference in Brussels.The cybersecurity center in July identified technical issues in Huawei's engineering processes that could make it less safe. Huawei said last month that it would take three to five years to fix the problems.Martin said the issues his agency identified relate to cybersecurity standards and are "not indicators of hostile activity by China." He told reporters that mistakes in software are the biggest issue for cybersecurity, more so than the risk of a foreign government getting backdoor access.Huawei competes with a few big rivals, notably Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson, to supply equipment for 5G networks.Martin said it's important not to let the telecom equipment supplier market shrink too much."Any company in an excessively dominant market position will not be incentivized to take cybersecurity seriously," Martin said, adding that such a company could be a "prime target for attack for the globe's most potent cyber attackers."In a sign of Britain's division over 5G, a security think tank warned the same day against using Huawei gear."Allowing Huawei's participation is at best naive, at worst irresponsible," the Royal United Services Institute said in a report, which cited factors including the difficulty of finding hidden "back doors" in software.Germany is still undecided on what to do. It has made clear it doesn't plan to explicitly bar any single manufacturer, though that leaves open the possibility it could frame system requirements in a way that effectively excludes Huawei.Officials are wary of the security issues that could arise with Chinese involvement, and the German Interior Ministry said Wednesday that internal discussions were still ongoing on how to proceed."A direct exclusion of a particular manufacturer from the 5G expansion is at the time not legally possible and also not planned," the Interior Ministry told The Associated Press. "For the Interior Ministry the focus is on adapting the security requirements of the telecommunications network in such a way that the security of the network remains guaranteed, including from possibly non-trustworthy manufacturers."The ministry said for that to be ensured, the requirements must be anchored in Germany's telecommunications law and discussions on how to do that are currently ongoing.___AP journalists Frank Jordans and David Rising in Berlin and Christopher Bodeen in Beijing contributed to this report.Load-Date: February 21, 2019End of Document

American families of missing Uighurs speak out at DC eventAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 26, 2019 Tuesday 12:22 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 756 wordsByline: By CHRISTINA LARSON, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Nearly two years after the Chinese government began to detain members of Muslim minority groups in western China, a growing number of family members abroad are refusing to remain silent.On Sunday, about three dozen relatives of some of the 1 million Uighurs, Kazakhs and others being held without charge spoke out about the mass detentions at an event in Washington, D.C., hoping to raise awareness of what many are calling a human rights travesty but which Beijing defends as necessary to counter violent religious extremism."If you know someone who is missing, it is time to speak up," said Ferkat Jawdat, a Virginia-based software engineer. He's lost contact with his 52-year-old mother in Xinjiang, a Chinese region home to the predominantly Muslim Uighur (pronounced WEE-gur) and Kazakh ethnic minorities.Xinjiang has been subject to a severe security crackdown in recent years that has made surveillance cameras and police checkpoints ubiquitous. The internment camps are a relatively recent phenomenon, but have expanded rapidly as a primary means of intimidation and social control.For members of the Uighur diaspora, losing a family member into the sprawling system has become all too common.Jawdat co-organized Sunday's gathering so that Uighurs in the U.S. could start collecting information on their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and even children whose whereabouts are unknown. They plan to present the data to the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and the U.S. State Department.Some of the attendees have confirmation that their loved ones are detained in Xinjiang. Others have simply lost contact - and fear the worst."We want to raise awareness about what can happen to American families - many of these people here are American citizens," said Jawdat, a U.S. citizen who helped organize the event, held in the basement of a public library.Similar gatherings took place concurrently in eight other countries, including Turkey, France, Germany, Australia and Canada, he said.Those in China with relatives abroad come under particular suspicion from the Chinese security forces, increasing the likelihood of them being interned.Abduwaris Ablimit, a 34-year-old chef living in Boston, said his first impulse had not been to speak out, frightened of what the Chinese authorities might do in retaliation.The last time he heard his parents' voices was on a recorded message through the Chinese messaging app WeChat."Please don't call me again, son," his mother said through sobs, Ablimit recalled. "Maybe one day we will see each other again."She sent the message in July 2017. Since then, Ablimit has lived in fear that his parents and brother, well-known Uighur pop singer Zahirshah Ablimit, were sent to an internment camp.His suspicions were confirmed in December, when Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported that a police officer in Ablimit's Xinjiang hometown said he had been involved in detaining Ablimit's parents. A second officer told RFA that he had arrested Ablimit's brother.Former camp detainees have told The Associated Press that after being confined in the camps, they were forced to renounce their faith and swear fealty to China's ruling Communist Party.They said they were subject to political indoctrination and psychological torture, without legal recourse. They describe conditions in the camps as grim, with poor food, crowded cells and little medical assistance.China says the camps are vocational training centers aimed at helping those vulnerable to extremism to be "cured" of such thoughts and gain job skills.Apart from Turkey, whose people share cultural, religious and linguistic ties with Uighurs, the Muslim world has remained largely silent over the camps. Experts attribute that to their economic dependence on China, similarly authoritarian political systems and Beijing's claims that it is countering a shared terror threat.In the face of such silence, relatives of internees are taking it upon themselves to speak out.After more than a year of being unable to reach his parents, Ablimit started talking to the media and reaching out to the U.S. consulates in Beijing and Shanghai. According to text messages reviewed by the AP, Ablimit received threatening messages from someone who claimed to be a Chinese police officer. The person urged Ablimit to stay quiet about his family's case.But Ablimit, who traveled to Washington for Sunday's meeting, wasn't swayed."I'm not afraid anymore," he said. "I just need to find the truth."Load-Date: February 26, 2019End of Document

Matador vs. Cuff, from Twitter to the courtsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 26, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 685 wordsBody A new brawl is played by the caricaturist Julio César González, Matador, and the Uribista senator Jonatan Tamayo (Maguito). But this time the difference is not in social networks but in the courts , because the cartoonist El Tiempo interposed a tutelage against the senator, after the parliamentarian was dispatched in their social networks, calling him a rapist.  Senator on Twitter  Upon notification of the Superior Court of Bogotá, Senator Tamayo loaded his Twitter account against the journalist and tried to clarify the meaning of the claim for which he was denounced. "Cynicism of @matadoreltiempo recognized violator of the good name and the honor of presidents, congressmen and citizens of good that we are not in accordance with their ideology . Now he demands me to give him his own medicine. Ah! he forgot that apart from Senator I am a troubadour "(Sic).  Senator on Twitter  In this regard, Matador said that the origin of the discussion was a trill in which he called Senator Tamayo a "petardo" and mocked that he traveled to China on behalf of Colombia. "On that occasion I saw the opportunity to make a funny comment against Senator Manguito, who showed up on his social networks on an official mission in China , and that is the same senator who wanted to revive the professional card for journalists because he did not like our trade The same who registered as a candidate in Petrism and then went to Uribismo and when questioned has little strategic outputs, as the time he said in the W that he did not know the presentation of his own project and, to justify this unfortunate explanation, he argued that he was recently raised, "explained the cartoonist. (To learn more about Senator Jonatan Tamayo, read here) "But the senator's response went far beyond humor and healthy discussion and decided to qualify me as a rapist, much in the style of what former President Uribe did with journalist Daniel Samper and for which he had to rectify himself. It did not bother me that he attacked me. What I can not accept is that he has pointed me out as a rapist , an accusation that has a sexual connotation. I'm used to being insulted, but not being slandered. So I filed a guardianship action. And he is a man of double morals, because he attacks me with those terms and then declares himself a Christian, "said the cartoonist. (This was the rectification of former President Uribe for calling Daniel Samper rapist) The incident between Matador and Manguito occurred in late January, when the parliamentarian released an image of him in China and reported that he was on an official mission at the invitation of the Chinese government to learn about science and technology issues. In this regard, Matador trilled: "The Chinese government rejects the warlike attack exercised by the Colombian government by sending it to such a 'firecracker'." To which Tamayo replied: "What a good thermometer, being criticized by a recognized VIOLATOR @matadoreltiempo is proof that I am doing things right" (Sic).  Senator on Twitter  When asked by El Espectador about the legal action filed against him, Tamayo said: "Article 15 of the Constitution says that you can defend your good name, and I did that. Matador, in a trill, said that I was a firecracker, but when I answer him with a trill in which I tell him that for me it is a pride to be criticized by a recognized rapist, there he does get offended. Everyone knows that he keeps violating the good name of good people. He was the one who violated my right to the good name, I never said that he raped a child, or anything sexual. "  And the parliamentarian continued in hisdefense: "I did not mean that he raped a child or anything. Our lawyer is arguing the same thing that I say: he never had an association with a sexual theme , and just as he shields himself in a pencil to attack, I answer him with this trova: My work is honest, as a man and senator, I prefer to be a muff and not be a killer. He gets upset and demands, and cheating is stubborn when I applied a dose of his own medicine. " Now it will be justice that determines who insulted whom.Load-Date: February 26, 2019End of Document

Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou files lawsuit accusing Canada of illegally detaining herCNN WireMarch 4, 2019 Monday 10:56 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 698 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Huawei's chief financial officer is accusing Canadian authorities of violating her rights when they detained her on behalf of the US government. Meng Wanzhou has filed a civil lawsuit in Canada alleging that she was unlawfully detained and questioned for three hours without being advised of her constitutional rights, and that her electronic equipment and luggage were illegally searched before she was told she was under arrest. Lawyers for Meng, who is also the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder, filed the lawsuit Friday and made the documents available to journalists on Sunday. She is seeking punitive damages and costs.The allegations relate to Meng's arrest at Vancouver International Airport on December 1. The detention of one of China's top tech executives at the request of the US government set off a political firestorm. In China, many viewed her arrest as a political move by the Trump administration to gain leverage in the clash between the two countries over trade and technology.Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and one of the biggest smartphone brands alongside Samsung and Apple. The Chinese company is a key player in the rollout of next-generation wireless technology, or 5G. But the United States, long wary of Huawei, is pressuring allies to limit the company's participation in 5G networks, saying it poses a national security threat. Citing Huawei's ties to the Chinese government, Washington says Beijing could use the company's equipment to spy on other nations, although it hasn't provided specific evidence to back up the accusations. Huawei denies that any of its products pose national security risks and says it would refuse any request by Beijing to use them for espionage.The US government has also indicted Meng and Huawei on charges of bank fraud and sanctions evasion, and has formally requested her extradition from Canada. Meng and Huawei both deny the charges. Her next court appearance is scheduled for Wednesday in Vancouver, where she has been released on bail with restrictions on her freedom of movement. Seizing Meng's electronic devices, including an iPadThe suit filed Friday by Meng's lawyers accuses Canadian authorities of using a routine border check at the Vancouver airport to unlawfully subject her "to a detention, search and interrogation to extract evidence from her before she was arrested."After Meng got off a flight from Hong Kong, officers from the Canada Border Services Agency stopped her and told her to surrender all her electronic devices, which included "two personal cellphones, an iPad, and a personal computer," according to the lawsuit. Officers later asked for the devices' passwords, which Meng surrendered believing she had no choice as the officials "intentionally failed to advise her of the true reasons for her detention, her right to counsel, and her right to silence." Only after searching and questioning her did the border officers turn her over to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which formally arrested her.As a direct result of the detention, Meng suffered damages including mental distress, anxiety and loss of liberty, the lawsuit says. She has severe hypertension, for which she was hospitalized after her arrest. The lawsuit is "alleging serious breaches of her constitutional rights and seeking damages for misfeasance in public office and false imprisonment," Howard Mickleson, one of Meng's lawyers, said in a statement. Lawyers representing the RCMP and Canada Border Services didn't respond to requests for comment outside of regular office hours. Huawei declined to comment on Meng's lawsuit. At a regular news briefing Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang reiterated Beijing's position that Canada and the United States "abused their bilateral extradition treaty" and "severely infringed" Meng's rights. He urged the US government to withdraw the arrest warrant and extradition request for Meng, and the Canadian government to immediately release her.Taylor Romine, Tony Marco and Nanlin Fang contributed to this report.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The fashion market and 'Trade 2.0'McKinsey & CompanyFebruary 7, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 1542 wordsByline: McKinsey & CompanyHighlight: Companies should make contingency plans for a potential shake-up of global value chains. Here's how the apparel trade could be reshaped by new barriers, trade tensions, and uncertainty.Body Link to Image Fashion is inherently sensitive to the policies and politics that shape cross-border trade. Recent talk of trade shifts between the United States and some of its key trading partners has brought the issue to the fore. At the same time, the axes of global trade are shifting, amid a surge in commerce between emerging economies in the Global South. The dynamics may lead to a rethinking of sourcing and pricing strategies in the year ahead.That's why "Trade 2.0" is one of the ten big trends for fashion players to watch in 2019. This article is an extract from our latest State of Fashion report, written in partnership with            the Business of Fashion (BoF); the broader report covers what you need to know about all ten.As 2019 begins, fashion companies find themselves in a crosscurrent of trade-related news flow. A sharp rise in trade tensions between the United States and other large economies seems set to increase costs for some players and increase the risk of disruption. At the same time, new trade agreements promise better trading conditions in certain instances.In the United States, the fashion industry accounts for 6 percent of imports but pays 51 percent of tariff receipts, so the tariffs issue is critically important. In addition, with new tariffs coming into force on goods from China (including leather clothing, woven fabrics, and wool yarn), there is a direct feed-through to the consumer. Companies such as Gap and Samsonite, which have large manufacturing operations in China, have said they plan to raise their consumer prices.Still, while China and the United States are raising tariffs against each other, China is at the same time trying to make some imports cheaper. A Chinese government decision to cut import duties led LVMH to reduce prices by 3 to 5 percent in July 2018 on some items sold in China.  In September 2018, China announced it would reduce tariffs for textiles and construction materials to 8.4 percent, from 11.5 percent. Any reduction of tariffs usually must be offered to all countries equally under World Trade Organization rules, but China said US goods would still be subject to retaliatory tariffs.Despite some of the positive developments in trade, the dominant theme over 2017 has been tightening of trade conditions between specific partners. For the G-20 economies, there were $74 billion worth of restrictive measures in May 2018, compared with $47 billion in May 2017, a rise of 58 percent. Trade-facilitating measures, which include eliminating or reducing tariffs and simplifying customs procedures, meanwhile, fell from $163 billion to just $83 billion, a 49 percent drop. Consumers are also noticing more gloomy trade sentiments: Google searches for the words "trade war," "trade tensions," or "tariffs" are at the highest level for at least five years, after growing by a factor of ten in 2018. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, predicts rising tariffs and that the ensuing escalation of trade tensions could reduce global economic growth by 0.5 percent by 2020. Perhaps unsurprisingly, executives are becoming concerned, and increasingly cite trade relations as a major worry for the coming year. McKinsey's Economic Conditions Snapshot in September 2018 was the second in a row in which trade policy was cited as a threat to global economic growth (exhibit). Sixty-two percent of respondents said it was their number one concern, up from 56 percent in March 2018. It's worth noting, however, that sentiment tempered somewhat in            December 2018.Exhibit Link to Image A related issue is Brexit. A report by the UK Trade Policy Observatory suggests that due to its high level of exports, reliance on international talent, and dependence of raw materials from abroad, the UK textiles, apparel, and footwear industry will be one of the hardest hit by the United Kingdom leaving the European Union in March 2019. Some 63 percent of clothing designers and 55 percent of UK-based luxury-goods makers are involved in exports, and around 10,000 EU citizens are employed in the UK fashion industry. This explains why some 80 percent of respondents from Fashion Roundtable, a lobbying body formed to advise the UK government on matters relating to Brexit respondents, said that they felt Brexit would be bad for fashion in the United Kingdom and European Union. The prospect of Brexit has also started to affect fashion companies in other countries, particularly those being paid in sterling, which has fallen by around 12 percent against the euro and 10 percent against the dollar since the Brexit referendum in 2016.Against this backdrop in Europe, the US fashion sector is also facing trade-related risks. According to the United States Fashion Industry Association's 2018 Fashion Industry Benchmarking Study, "protectionist trade policy agenda" in the United States is the number-one business challenge. Before 2017, it never ranked higher than eight. The United States has announced tariff hikes on $200 billion worth of goods from China, including clothing. To highlight the proactive stance taken by some fashion players, the American Apparel & Footwear Association at the end of May 2018 published a letter signed by 60 US labels (including Abercrombie & Fitch, Kate Spade, Levi Strauss, Macy's, Nike and Under Armour) arguing against increased taxation of Chinese textile and apparel imports.Some fashion companies have begun to reconsider their presence in, and exposure to, countries where tariff barriers could further increase the cost of doing business. Puma, Steve Madden, and Wolverine World Wide are among companies that stated they would consider moving production out of China. Many companies had begun this process before the trade tensions mounted, but they cite the recent developments as a tipping point.McKinsey's 2017 survey of 63 international chief procurement officers suggested that China's share of apparel exports is likely to continue falling, although trade tensions are just one of several factors driving this downward trend. Some 62 percent of respondents said they expected China's share of their companies' sourcing to decrease between now and 2025.Trade data shows that these plans are now becoming reality: a marked and ongoing shift is under way in the apparel industry's sourcing markets, with new emerging markets increasing their share compared with China. Still, while China might have passed its manufacturing zenith in apparel, it will likely remain an indispensable sourcing market for some time to come.While concern over trade tensions is rising, there are also positive dynamics, with new agreements being put in place and new trade routes being developed. The EU has recently entered into new agreements including clothing and apparel with Canada, Mexico, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam, and several countries from Eastern Europe. In September 2018, Canada agreed to join the United States and Mexico in a trade deal that will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.In addition, South-South trade is on the rise, amid expectations it will increase from around 25 percent of global trade at present to around 30 percent in 2030. Already, significant new relationships are emerging. China's expansive One Belt, One Road initiative, which involves large investments in the development of trade routes in the region, has the potential to play a large role in this development.Finally, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) will enable more free trade between Asia and South America and within Asia. RCEP members export around $405 billion of textiles a year (more than half of the global total) and import around $115 billion, so the agreements will have a significant economic impact.Overall, we expect trade-related forces will drive two key dynamics in 2019. Escalating trade tensions will see international brands rethink their sourcing strategies, perhaps to the benefit of countries involved in newly negotiated trade agreements. A further increase in South-South trade, especially between emerging countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is likely. Fast fashion, which depends on short lead times, will need to find new strategies to maintain delivery speed and production quality, for example through nearshoring or even onshoring. Still, tough commercial decisions will be required in the face of tariffs in key consumer markets. Luxury players, especially those that derive most of their income from China or the United States, may be required to choose between raising prices or managing squeezed margins.For more on all ten trends that will define the fashion agenda in 2019, see The State of Fashion 2019: A year of awakening.About the authorsAnita Balchandani is a partner in McKinsey's London office, where Marco Beltrami is a consultant; Achim Berg is a senior partner in the Frankfurt office, Saskia Hedrich is a senior expert in the Munich office, and Felix Rölkens is an associate partner in the Berlin office.

TIBETAN LANGUAGE ADVOCATE MARKS THIRD YEAR BEHIND BARSStates News ServiceJanuary 28, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 510 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Tibetan language advocate Tashi Wangchuk marked his third year behind bars on Sunday after being convicted on a charge of separatism for promoting the use of his native language in Tibetan areas of China, amid renewed calls by rights and media organizations for his release.Wangchuk was sentenced on Jan. 4, 2018 by a court in Qinghai's Yulshul Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture following a controversial trial in which the prosecution based its case on a video report by the New York Times documenting the activist's work.Wangchuk was arrested on Jan. 27, 2016, two months after the Times ran its report, and was handed a five-year prison term on Jan. 4, 2018 by a court in Qinghai's Yulshul Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.His sentence of five years will include his time already spent in detention.In the video, Wangchuk is seen traveling to Beijing to press his case for the wider use of the Tibetan language in Tibetan schools. Prosecutors used this as evidence at his trial, despite his repeated disavowals of separatism and his stated intention to use the Chinese law to protect the Tibetan tongue.Speaking in a recent interview with RFA's Tibetan Service, James TaggerDeputy Director for Freedom of Expression at the writers' organization PEN-USAsaid that "We at PEN America have been repeatedly vocal about the fact that Tashi Wangchuk did not deserve to be sentenced even for a single day, given that his peaceful advocacy was not in any way criminal.""This third year anniversary of his detention coming up will certainly be, I'm sure, a painful date for his family," Tagger said."But it should also represent a painful moment for anyone anywhere who is concerned about minority language rights and about our right as human beings to peacefully advocate for our communities and to express ourselves and our culture."Also speaking to RFA, Francisco BencosmeAsia-Pacific Advocacy Manager at Amnesty International in Washington D.C.noted that following Wangchuk's incarceration, his lawyers have repeatedly been denied access to their client."This really shows how far the Chinese government is willing to go to harass and prevent Tashi from getting the right to counsel that he deserves, even according to Chinese law," Bencosme said."This shows the ruthless lengths to which the Chinese authorities are going in order to silence those [whom] it fears," he said.And in an email this week to RFA, New York Times Company spokesperson Danielle Rhoades slammed Wangchuk's sentence, calling the court's move "an action that appeared intended to silence critics, impede the free flow of information, and ultimately deprive Chinese citizens of information."Writers, singers, and artists promoting Tibetan national identity and culture have frequently been detained by Chinese authorities, with many handed long jail terms, following region-wide protests against Chinese rule that swept Tibetan areas of China in 2008.Reported by Tashi Wangchuk for RFA's Tibetan Service.

Philippine network executive dismisses Huawei equipment concernsUPIFebruary 13, 2019 Wednesday 1:01 PM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 352 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Dec. 31 BodyThe United States is warning countries around the world against using equipment from Chinese company Huawei Technologies, but in the Philippines, a firm is dismissing the concerns as overblown.In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Globe Telecom president and chief executive Ernest Lawrence Cu said potential threats Huawei poses to national security were exaggerated "to a certain extent," and plans are in place to roll out 5G services in collaboration with Huawei and other firms."We're very confident that we're well protected," Cu said. "They may provide the equipment, but we run the network and so we know what passes over our network, what goes through it."Cu's response to security concerns comes after U.S. Secretary of State  said in Budapest Huawei poses threats to the privacy of networks."What's imperative is that we share with [the Hungarian government] the things we know about the risks that Huawei's presence in their networks presents," he said. "Actual risks to their own people, to the loss of privacy protections for their own people, the risk that China will use this data in a way that is not in the best interest of Hungary."By Tuesday the Chinese responded with a strong criticism of U.S. campaigns against Huawei, a private firm that has denied ties to the Chinese government.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying had said Washington is "unscrupulously fabricating groundless accusations" and the actions are "unfair and immoral."As the United States seeks the extradition of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, nations in Europe are weighing their options on Huawei.In Britain, British Telecom said it would not buy Huawei equipment for the core of its 5G network, but other parts would be used. German Chancellor  had said last week "big discussions" about Huawei are ongoing."We need to talk to China to ensure that companies do not simply give up all data that is used in the Chinese state," Merkel had said.The United States has raised concerns about Chinese spying via Huawei equipment, but has not provided public evidence to support those concerns, according to CNN.Load-Date: February 14, 2019End of Document

Freedom is not fantasticCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 9, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 496 wordsBody In the second half of 2018, a series of government-level alerts in several countries focused on Chinese companies such as Huawei and its dubious privacy policies.  "We have to be concerned about these companies," said Vice President of the European Commission (EC) for the Digital Single Market, Andrus Ansip, in December on the risk to European digital security of the operation of Chinese technological giants.  Huawei is not only the second largest manufacturer of smartphones (behind Samsung): it is also the world's largest provider of telecommunications network equipment (several national states are counted among its customers) and the concern is not its efficiency, but its origin .  Because the Chinese government last year established a new law that requires technology companies in the country to "cooperate with intelligence services", and this includes both the devices in the hands of private users and companies or governments. It almost goes without saying that by "cooperation" we could understand "facilitation of back doors to access information stored on any device labeled" made in China ".  That is one of the reasons that reports from NGOs such as Freedom House have been particularly harsh about the cut in privacy and the risk that the "Chinese model" will take off in other countries.  The annual report "Freedom on the Net" shows that of the 65 countries studied, 26 showed a permanent decline in digital freedoms since June 2017. Among the most serious cases are Egypt, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, the Philippines and one of Latin America : Venezuela.  Just as data, Argentina is in the "free" category in the 28th position, although it is one step lower than the previous year and it is worth reading the extensive and meticulous report of our country.  Why the worry? The NGO is one of those that detect an increase in censorship in the world in response to misinformation, a more generalized collection of personal data and a certain extension of the Chinese model of digital authoritarianism in countries like Russia, where laws are also moving forward that oblige the manufacturers or developers to "cooperate".  On another level, the use that Trump and Bolsonaro make of the fake news (just two leaders who label any dissident information of fake news) has also been denounced as a latent threat against the democratic system, pointing to the influence exerted from of lies that spread like truths in social networks or WhatsApp.  As a corollary, 2019 starts with an extra concern: is it possible that, under the pretext of protecting democratic institutions, measures are taken that increase the level of vigilance over citizens?  Crossing the line that divides a legitimate government effort to preserve the common good of plain and simple political persecution of dissent by digital means is a danger that appears, even as more threatening than the "problem" of trolls or fake news.  Freedom is fanatical, Carlos Solari dixit.  Advertising       Load-Date: January 10, 2019End of Document

FedEx Results Are a Flashing Red Signal on the Health of the Global EconomyRealMoneyMarch 20, 2019 Wednesday 12:12 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 706 wordsByline: Jim CollinsHighlight: Another pressing concern for FedEx is the margin compression in its U.S. business.BodyIt's a Fed day! I have been reading that all morning, but, really, what market commentators should be noting is that it is a "FedEx day." FedEx  shares have fallen more than 5% this morning, as the company's guidance for EPS for Fiscal 2020 (the 12 month period ending March 2020) of $15.10 to $15.90 disappointed a Street that had set a consensus of $15.97.FedEx should be considered a bellwether for the global economy, but it seems that investors only focus on the company once every three months, which is regrettable in light of the intense investor focus on the FAANG tech titans. Apple  sells a product that is far too expensive for the average Chinese consumer and Amazon  does not even own "Amazon.cn," although it does transact business through that site. The main sites of Netflix  , Facebook  and Alphabet's  Google are blocked by the Chinese government.So, if you want to know about the state of the Chinese economy and its impact on the global economy, you listen to Fred Smith and FedEx. Here are several quotes from Mr. Smith and his management team's presentation on the analyst conference call last night:Since our last earnings call, we have seen the overall China economy slow down further, and this has impacted other Asian economies.Asia volume weakness, which we experienced during peak season, deepened post Chinese New Year.(In answer to an analyst question) You could tell me, are we going to get a trade deal done with China and is Brexit going to come out good?And so, we knew that the slowdown coming in Q1, it was just - it was the pre-Chinese New Year. The peak was very muted, and the post-Chinese New Year was very, very soft.In case you missed that collective sledgehammer, China has been weak for FedEx. Management also noted a slowing in the U.S and pronounced weakness in Europe. That weakness in Europe is exacerbated by FedEx's larger presence there owing to the $4.8 billion acquisition of Dutch delivery services company TNT in May 2016. Mr Smith noted that TNT is still recovering from the Notpetya virus attack on June 27th, 2016, an incident that Mr. Smith noted "had TNT been a standalone company at that time, it would have been bankrupt(ed.) " Ouch.So, FedEx results are a flashing red signal on the health of the global economy in the midst of the S&P 500's 28-year-best >12% gain to start 2019.Another pressing concern for FedEx is the margin compression in its U.S. business, which seems to be to be driven more by secular changes in the freight business than cyclical economic factors. The background is simple. If you are a corporate IT manager and want a server delivered to New York from California there is no company on Earth better than FedEx at that task. If you are consumer and want a pair of running shoes delivered from Tennessee to your home in North Carolina (I just did this,) any company can do that.As FedEx management noted once again on last night's call, FedEx simply cannot charge as much for the smaller packages generated by consumer e-commerce purchases as it can for larger, corporate deliveries or guaranteed overnight deliveries of important documents (yes, there is email now.) Also, those deliveries tend to happen over shorter distances, as companies like Amazon are opening new warehouses at a frenetic pace to be closer to their end consumer.So, in industry jargon, that means a lower "yield" for FedEx in both the FedEx Express and FedEx Ground businesses. A quick check of the transcript shows FedEx management used the word yield 14 times on last night's all. I believe that yield pressure will offset management's efforts to trim costs via layoffs and other means, and that FedEx is going to face declining margins - apart from seasonality in its core business - for the next few years.So, that's a tough one for the market to digest. A weaker macro picture combined with micro pressures. No matter what, Powell and his merry men and women announce this afternoon, investors should be watching for more "FedEx moments" as the calendar turns to April and the quarterly earnings season commences in earnest.(Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

Huawei files suit against U.S. as dispute around equipment intensifiesFierceWirelessMarch 7, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 596 wordsByline: Kendra ChamberlainBodyHuawei, the world's biggest telecom equipment maker, has filed suit against the U.S. government challenging a recently passed law that bans federal agencies from buying Huawei products. The lawsuit was filed in Texas, where the company's U.S. headquarters are located.“This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers,” Huawei Deputy Chairman Guo Ping said at a news conferencein China. Huawei's lawsuit argues that the ban is unconstitutional because it singles out a specific group for punishment without a trial. Huawei            is asking for a declaratory judgment that the restrictions targeting Huawei are unconstitutional, and a permanent injunction against these restrictions. (As Digital Trends points out, it appears that Guo and other Huawei executives read their statements about the lawsuit off foldable Mate X phones.)RELATED: Huawei leader calls out U.S. for privacy contradictionsPresident Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act(PDF) into law in August 2018 amid fears that Chinese equipment makers were surreptitiously spying on Americans. The law singles out two Chinese telecom manufacturers, Huawei and ZTE, and bars federal agencies from using their products. The U.S. government also urged AT&T to end its negotiations with Huawei in 2018 when the carrier planned to offer Huawei handsets to customers, according to a            report from Reuters.The Trump administration has been lobbying allies to take the same action against Huawei. Australia is banning wireless carriers from using Huawei products on their 5G networks; Japan has banned its federal agencies from using equipment from either Huawei or ZTE. The U.K. and Germany are reportedly considering similar bans, though a news report from Forbes suggests the U.S. lobbying efforts haven't convinced some allies to join the ban.Huawei's Guo claimed neither members of Congress nor the White House has been able to produce evidence proving that Huawei and ZTE are, in fact, spying on consumers. “We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,” Guo said.RELATED: The China situation has 3 possible outcomesHuawei's troubles began in 2012, under the Obama administration, when a Congressional report(PDF) raised security concerns about the company's networking equipment. The report details that Huawei and ZTE both failed to cooperate with investigators compiling the report, concluding that “Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems.”U.S. officials have argued that if the Chinese government ever requested backdoor access to telecom equipment, Huawei would have to comply. Vice President Mike Pence reiterated this argument as recently as last month. “Chinese law requires them to provide Beijing's vast security apparatus with access to any data that touches their networks or equipment,” he said, speaking at the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany.RELATED: T-Mobile is at the center of the DOJ's allegations against HuaweiGuo denied the company has ever complied with such a request. “We will never allow others to install any in our equipment.”Huawei is currently facing unrelated charges filed by U.S. prosecutors in New York and Washington state. Prosecutors have argued that the company tried to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile, and that it violated U.S. sanctions against Iran. Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada in December 2018 and is facing extradition to the U.S.Load-Date: March 13, 2019End of Document

United Kingdom identifies fresh Huawei risks to telecom networksStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeMarch 29, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 614 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyThe government-led watchdog set up to vet Huawei products has given a damning report on the cyber security risks posed by the Chinese company's involvement in the British telecommunications industry.The report, issued by the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of Government Communications Headquarters , said it could provide "only limited assurance that the long-term security risks can be managed in the Huawei equipment now deployed in the UK".The board - which includes officials from Britain's GCHQ communications intelligence agency - said in the report that the company had made "no material progress" addressing security flaws and it didn't have confidence in Huawei's capacity to deliver on proposed measures to address "underlying defects". The report said the National Cyber Security Centre does not believe the defects identified in Huawei equipment "are the result of Chinese state interference".In Canada, the federal government is still undertaking a review of 5G and of whether it's safe to allow Huawei to provide equipment to telecom operators in order to deploy the next mobile network iteration. It had better repay the favor by fixing its software soon, because reports such as that issued this week just give the US more ammunition."We see them giving a pretty public failing grade - and our assessment is we couldn't mitigate or manage [those risks], either", the official said.The company has announced a £1.5 billion programme to enhance its software engineering capabilities. According to the report, Huawei's software development process is so complex and antiquated that it makes it hard for the British spies to analyze the bugs. For instance, some builds may be patched for bugs, while others may not be.What is the oversight board?Still, the official stressed, "We think it's pretty heinous, and that's after Huawei got to sand the edges off to make it less so".Dovish RBNZ sinks Australian dollar for humiliated RBAHe believes that an OCR cut will come in May, as they would not have done what they did today if it was not on the table. The New Zealand dollar was down 0.2 per cent at $0.6786, stretching losses from the previous day's 1.6 per cent slide.Furthermore the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, has previously warned that the U.S. may cease to exchange secret intelligence info. with countries that allow kit from Huawei into their core networks, which is a significant consideration for the UK. The latter recently signaled it would not move to block Huawei from its 5G networks, in defiance of the U.S.'s appeals.White House security officials believe Huawei's links to the Communist Beijing government means the firm cannot be trusted.The EU is instead going more the United Kingdom route, calling for increased product testing and certification, and Huawei has praised this approach as being more proportionate than the American stance.The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.The U.S. official said those findings support similar American assessments that concluded Huawei's equipment can not be "made safe from Chinese influence or disruption". The Trump administration contends that because of Huawei's connections to the Chinese government and military, the company's software and hardware could be used by China's Ministry of State Security or the Peoples' Liberation Army for espionage or sabotage.And the forcefulness with which the USA has been issuing its own warnings, the official suggested, was a reflection of the high stakes at hand."We can't afford an environment where the lowest bidder drives out the most secure Western options for economic reasons", the official said.Load-Date: March 29, 2019End of Document

AP Explains: The promise of 5G wireless - speed, hype, riskAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 11, 2019 Monday 5:40 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 711 wordsByline: By MAE ANDERSON and TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WritersDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - A much-hyped network upgrade called "5G" means different things to different people.To industry proponents, it's the next huge innovation in wireless internet. To the U.S. government, it's the backbone technology of a future that America will wrestle with China to control. To many average people, it's simply a mystery.The technology is one of the issues expected to take center stage at the MWC mobile conference in Barcelona, Spain, this month. The interest goes well beyond engineers: In Washington, there are fears that China could take the lead in developing the technology and sell equipment that could be used to spy on Americans.What, exactly, is 5G wireless - and will you even notice when it comes online?WHAT IS 5G?5G is a new technical standard for wireless networks - the fifth, naturally - that promises faster speeds; less lag, or "latency," when connecting to the network; and the ability to connect many devices to the internet without bogging it down. 5G networks will ideally be better able to handle more users, lots of sensors and heavy traffic.Before we can all use it, wireless companies and phone makers have to upgrade. Phones need new chips and radio antennas. The phone you have today won't work with a 5G network.Wireless companies have been getting ready. They've been revamping their network equipment, buying up chunks of radio spectrum for carrying 5G signals, and installing new 5G antennas on cellphone towers, utility poles and streetlights. Wireless providers will invest $275 billion in 5G-related networks in the U.S., according to CTIA, an industry trade group.WHEN WILL IT BE AVAILABLE?A true U.S. mobile rollout will start in 2019. It will take a few years to go national, and even then more rural areas of the country will not be covered in the "millimeter wave" frequencies that promise the highest data speeds and capacities, said Michael Thelander, CEO of wireless consultancy Signals Research Group.Thelander predicts that China may lag the U.S. by a year in its initial rollout, but will ultimately have the biggest deployment, while European countries will build out more slowly.Beware of confusion, though. Wireless carriers have a history of rushing to slap the latest-and-greatest label on their networks, and this time is no different. AT&T has already applied the name 5G on a service that's not really 5G. (Sprint, upset, then sued its larger rival.)Once the network is ready, you'll need a 5G-enabled phone to connect to it. The first ones should be available in the first half of 2019, but a 5G iPhone isn't expected until 2020. 5G phones will most likely be more expensive than current 4G phones. Don't worry, even when 5G turns on, you can keep using 4G phones, just not at 5G speeds.WHAT CAN 5G DO?There's a considerable amount of hype over the promise of 5G. Industry groups say it will promote smart cities by connecting sensor networks that could manage traffic and quickly identify streetlight outages. 5G could connect self-driving cars and fuel new applications in virtual and augmented reality. Its high-speed connections could enable better remote surgery and other telemedicine, help companies automate their factories and offer businesses dedicated high-speed internet lanes."5G speeds, and ever-faster home broadband, will mean that existing applications will get richer, and also that new applications will emerge - new Flickrs, YouTubes or Snapchats. We don't know what yet," Benedict Evans, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote in a January blog post .The most immediate impact on consumers will be faster download speeds for movies and other video. Thelander says your phone's internet will work better in crowded locations such as stadiums.WHAT ARE THE SECURITY CONCERNS?The 5G network is one front in rising tensions between the U.S. and China. The U.S. government has warned U.S. companies not to use Chinese telecom technology in communications networks due to security concerns, and is pressing other countries to ban Huawei, a Chinese telecom company, from 5G network buildouts.U.S. officials have suspected for years that the Chinese government could use Huawei network equipment to help it spy. Huawei has rejected such accusations.Load-Date: February 12, 2019End of Document

Industry groups say it will promote smart cities by connecting sensor networks that could manage traffic and quickly identify streetlight outages. 5G could connect self-driving cars and fuel new applications in virtual and augmented reality. Its high-speed connections could enable better remote surgery and other telemedicine, help companies automate their factories and offer businesses dedicated high-speed internet lanes."5G speeds, and ever-faster home broadband, will mean that existing applications will get richer, and also that new applications will emerge - new Flickrs, YouTubes or Snapchats. We don't know what yet," Benedict Evans, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote in a January blog post .The most immediate impact on consumers will be faster download speeds for movies and other video. Thelander says your phone's internet will work better in crowded locations such as stadiums.WHAT ARE THE SECURITY CONCERNS?The 5G network is one front in rising tensions between the U.S. and China. The U.S. government has warned U.S. companies not to use Chinese telecom technology in communications networks due to security concerns, and is pressing other countries to ban Huawei, a Chinese telecom company, from 5G network buildouts.U.S. officials have suspected for years that the Chinese government could use Huawei network equipment to help it spy. Huawei has rejected such accusations.Load-Date: February 12, 2019End of Document

A Europe in distress opens the Mobile of Barcelona and there shelters HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 26, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 979 wordsBody Barcelona.- The US offensive and its president Donald Trump against Huawei reached the Chinese company until the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, where this year a financially troubled Europe in its telecommunications sector has sheltered the eastern manufacturer and this, in a way Thank you, he exhibited here the latest of his gadgets that he has not been able to present at CES in Las Vegas due to pressures from Washington and has been signing and negotiating infrastructure supply contracts with different operators that are in Spain this week.  And to win even more to the European calls telcos, the technology that recently surpassed to Apple in the market of the smartphones, imported vehicles of the house Mercedes Benz for the transfer of executives by the different headquarters of the MWC2019 , thus detonating other additional jobs that positively impact even the economies of Germany and France. That's why the Mobile of Barcelona speaks more in Chinese than in English this year and almost nothing in Spanish.  Huawei is being persecuted by the United States, as repercussion by the commercial war and the geopolitical differences that this country maintains with China in different global issues and one of them has to do with what nation and what technological standard will be the winner to build from there the first 5G telecommunication networks, those, according to experts and the European industry that visits the technology fair in Barcelona, will revolutionize man-man, man-machine and machine-machine communications from this same 2019, a whole transformation of industrial activity and the application of technologies to everyday life.  The Chinese company needs Europe to grow and in fact, the European telecommunications sector is one of its main markets. And Europe does not want to lose an allied manufacturer of equipment that participates in the entire value chain, from the construction of fiber optics, radio bases, antennas and power stations, to mobile phones and mobile applications, areas in which European suppliers like Ericsson are hardly competitive. the Americans Alcatel-Lucent and Cisco and that, companies such as Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom -whose utility collapsed 37% in 2018- know it before their financial and technical challenges and they also look at it in the pavilions of the Mobile World Congress 2019.  Telecom Italia, which lost 114 million euros in its fiscal year 2018, accompanies Huawei. Vodafone, at a time when Moody's downgraded its rating from "Baa1" to "Baa2", thus complicating its investment plans and credit applications, has requested a vote of confidence for Huawei and demanded proof of the risks of hiring Chinese technology. Telefonica, with a mega debt on its head for around 50,000 million euros and operational complications in Mexico and Brazil, openly said on the first day of MWC Barcelona that vetoing Huawei will mean taking out of the industry a supplier that is a leader in innovation and whose presence prevents the components from becoming more expensive, pressing even more financially a sector that links a decade trying to figure out how to recover investments and how to make users consume more value-added products.  The United States also looks with suspicion on Huawei, because within the global telecommunications business the component supply accounts for about 58% of sales and there a discreet Huawei gains participation every day to Nokia and Ericsson. Today, for example, Huawei signed inMobile of Barcelona a contract with the operator Rain of South Africa to launch one of the first 5G networks in that southern country.  In Europe, Huawei has twenty years of presence and its jewel is Germany and then the United Kingdom, which separately, have criticized the attacks aimed at a Huawei that has started the construction of fifth generation networks in their territories. In Germany, according to the analysis house, Huawei has built between 30 and 35% of Deutsche Telekom's 4G networks.  Washington presumes that Huawei has committed thirteen different crimes, including industrial espionage against one of its telecommunication companies and also claims that Huawei provided infrastructure to the government and companies of Iran, despite the sanctions known against that economy.  Huawei, appearing this morning as an ally of Europe and trying to take away the ghost of the United States that flies over the Barcelona Mobile - a delegation from that country was present on the day of the MWC 2019 inauguration - assured that there are no hidden doors in its technology where the Chinese government can enter from Beijing to spy on the information generated by users in the West.  "The United States has no evidence against us and our 5G in its accusation and the irony is that the United States Cloud Act allows the entities of that government to access data beyond the borders," said the Huawei rotating president, Guo Ping, this morning at the Mobile World Congress.  "We do not do anything wrong, I say it as clearly as possible: Huawei has not used and will never use rear doors and will not allow anyone to do it with their equipment," said Guo Ping in the auditorium. MWC 2019.  Australia, Japan and New Zealand have already served the US letters rogatory and have ignored Ping's words about Huawei's defense.  But Europe, warning that the 5G will force a new investment cycle and is locked in the competition of its telecommunications operators against Internet companies based in Silicon Valley that avoid responding to their legislation, prefer to maintain their trust in Huawei and perhaps expect that company supports to meet the GSMA's forecast that 5G will demand more than 300,000 million dollars in investment by 2025 in its own region and thus bring to life terms that now seem utopian like Industry 4.0, augmented reality or advanced telemedicine. Load-Date: February 26, 2019End of Document

Huawei 5G Risk Can Be Managed, Say UK Cybersecurity BossesLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsFebruary 21, 2019 Thursday 5:34 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 579 wordsBody Any potential risk posed by Chinese technology giant Huawei to UK telecoms infrastructure can be mitigated, government cybersecurity bosses have determined.The National Cyber Security Centre has concluded that it can mitigate any risks posed by using the Chinese firm's equipment in communications systems such as the upcoming rollout of new 5G networks, according to a report by the Financial Times.The reported conclusion, which has not yet been published, comes despite ongoing fears raised by the US over the safety and security of Huawei equipment, which it believes could be ordered by the Chinese state to gather data for intelligence purposes.Huawei has always maintained it has no links to the Chinese government other than to pay taxes, and last week accused the US of a "geopolitical campaign" against the company in an attempt to gain leverage in trade negotiations with China.The report suggests this new UK stance could convince other nations to soften their position on the Chinese firm.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has previously expressed concerns over Huawei, but former GCHQ boss Robert Hannigan suggested last week that the issue was too complex to simply ban the firm.An NCSC spokeswoman said: "The National Cyber Security Centre is committed to the security of UK networks, and we have a unique oversight and understanding of Huawei engineering and cybersecurity."As was made clear in July's HCSEC oversight board, the NCSC has concerns around Huawei's engineering and security capabilities. We have set out the improvements we expect the company to make."The latest annual HCSEC report will be published in the near future."Downing Street said "no decisions have been taken" yet.UK Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said: "Our review of the right policy approach to 5G security and resilience is still ongoing, the review is looking at a range of options and no decisions have been taken."He added: "We are committed to ensuring the UK's telecoms networks are fully secure. The Government and British telecoms operators work with a range of companies to manage cybersecurity risks while ensuring the UK can continue to benefit from new technology."Huawei's chief marketing officer for wireless network products, Peter Zhou, said last week that "cybersecurity and privacy protection are the overarching priority of Huawei"."And the company has recently announced that in the coming five years an additional two billion dollars will be invested to further improve our software engineering capability so as to ensure that more trusted and reliable products will be developed," he said.Several countries, including the US, Australia and New Zealand, have already taken steps to restrict or limit Huawei's presence in its 5G network infrastructure over security concerns.The new communications technology is expected to begin rolling out later this year, greatly increasing the amount of data that can be sent over a network.However, Eric Xu, one of Huawei's three rotating chairmen, recently suggested the US labelling of Huawei as a cyber threat was an attempt by the country to stifle the firm's growing status as a tech industry leader."Some other people argue that if Huawei equipment was used in those countries, US agencies would find it harder to get access to information about people or find it harder to intercept their mobile communications."By Martyn Landi, Press Association Technology Correspondentsource: Press AssociationLoad-Date: February 22, 2019End of Document

Could they spy on us from a subway car?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 12, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 405 wordsBody The warnings sound as if they were a Hollywood spy movie: the Chinese integrate a malicious program (malware) into the security camera system of a Washington Metro wagon that allows surveillance of Pentagon or White House officials. They travel on the Blue Line, sending images to Beijing.  Or think that sensors installed in wagons discreetly record conversations of officials.  Congress and the Pentagon have taken the warnings seriously, and now the Metro will do the same. The transportation agency in Washington decided to reinforce cybersecurity in the contracts that it will award in this year to acquire Metro wagons.  The decision made by the Washington Metro comes amidst pressure from China in its attempt to dominate the multibillion-dollar Metro wagon market across the United States.  The railway company of Chinese origin Railway Rolling Stock Corp has offered bargain prices to win four of the five major subway wagon contracts in the United States.  No US company makes Metro wagons, so China competes in that market against companies in Asia, Europe and Canada.  Links, between manufacturers with the Chinese government  "My concern is that (Chinese) companies sponsored by the state can serve as platforms to lead cyber espionage against the United States," said David Horner, who represents the federal government as deputy assistant secretary of transportation in the United States.  "These risks today are not widely understood, but their importance is manifesting very quickly."  For his part, Andrew Grotto, former director of Cybersecurity Policy at the National Security Council comments on the subject: "The risk of espionage is exceptionally high in our nation's capital."  Currently, he is a member of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. Through an email reply to the newspaper The Washington Post: "The malware could divert the data collected from high-definition security cameras. An adversary with that data could then use facial recognition algorithms to track users. "  China has been accused of incorporating spying technology into its products.

UK telecoms CEO: We've seen no 'cause for concern' over HuaweiCNN WireFebruary 8, 2019 Friday 5:28 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 538 wordsByline: By Charles Riley and Samuel Burke, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  UK telecoms group BT has seen no evidence that technology from China's Huawei poses a security risk."Over the years that we've worked with Huawei, we've not yet seen anything that gives us cause for concern," Marc Allera, the CEO of BT's consumer brands, told CNN on Friday. "We work closely with a large number of bodies --- government and security," he added. "We continue to work with all of those relevant bodies to answer all the questions that are being asked right now."Huawei's business has come under threat in recent months as an increasing number of governments express concern that its technology could be used by Chinese spies. Yet no supporting evidence has been made public.Huawei has repeatedly denied that its products are a security risk. It maintains that it is a privately owned company with no ties to the Chinese government."We work with the world's leading telecoms operators helping to deliver safe, secure and reliable networks to millions of customers around the world," a company spokesperson said Friday. "Cyber-security is our top concern and as an independent global company we are totally committed to supplying the best possible and safest technology to our clients."Huawei has spent decades building a strong presence in scores of markets around the world, including the United Kingdom, helped by reliable hardware and competitive pricing.It's now on the defensive after a number of countries including Australia blocked wireless carriers from using some of its products, citing national security concerns.A British government oversight panel that monitors Huawei's activities in the United Kingdom warned last year that it can provide only "limited assurance" that its telecoms equipment poses no threat to national security.The supervisory panel also said that "technical issues" had been identified in Huawei's engineering processes, leading to "new risks in the UK telecommunications networks."Huawei defended itself in a letter to UK lawmakers made public this week, saying that it would take up to five years to see "tangible results" in upgrading its systems."Enhancing our software engineering capabilities is like replacing components on a high-speed train in motion," the letter stated. "It is a complicated and involved process."BT said in December that it would not buy Huawei equipment for the core of its next generation 5G network, which launches this year in 16 UK cities.The company said at the time that it would keep Huawei as an "important equipment provider outside the core network," using its equipment in areas that are considered "benign," such as masts or towers.The big question now is whether Huawei will be shut out of additional Western 5G networks, decisions that would risk inflaming tensions with Beijing.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said this week that "there are big discussions about Huawei" in her country."We need to talk to China to ensure that companies do not simply give up all data that is used to the Chinese state," said Merkel. She added that "safeguards" were needed to protect data.Michael Kaplan and Ivana Kottasová contributed reporting.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Cheryl and Lauren, I'll see you shortly. I have good news, but you're going to have to wait for it. Good morning, everybody. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, January 3rd. Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.Apple shocks the market. The tech giant slashing its sales guidance for the first time in more than 15 years. CEO Tim Cook says weakness is in China is to blame and the stock sliding ahead of the open. You can look at the Dow draft and that stock down eight percent. That is roughly what the stock made in the last year. So, losing one year's gains in one morning and the warning taking a toll on other big technology names and the broader market. We will dig into that. Netflix down, which was up more than 30 percent last year, is down almost three percent this morning.But you have selling across the board. You're seeing that in the overall markets. We're going to dig in to this question. Is this company-specific or does it really hit on an array of problems weighing on stocks? Certainly this is weighing on stocks this morning. A 365-point loss on the Dow Futures as we enter the second trading day of the New Year, an even bigger loss percentage-wise on the NASDAQ 100. The move in Apple is set to shave about -- this is rough -- about 80 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the open. This after a choppy session on Wall Street yesterday. The major market gauges did manage to pose slight gains on the day, but they were slight and were was certainly hesitation and worry in these markets.Checking the global market action in Europe. We have selling across the board. The biggest loser at the moment, the DAX in Germany down more than one percent. In Asia overnight, we look at -- the Japanese markets were still closed, but there were losses in Shanghai, the Hang Seng, and KOSPI in South Korea. The South Korean market being the biggest loser there.The Shutdown Showdown enters day 13 and it comes as Democrats take over the House today. A high-stakes meeting at the White House ending with no deal as the President and top Democrat show zero signs of backing down over funding President Trump's border wall.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Could be a long time and it could be quickly. Could be a long time. It's too important a subject to walk away from.NANCY PELOSI, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: Our question to the President and to the Republicans is, why don't you accept what you have already done to open up government and that enable us to have 30 days to negotiate for border security.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Congressional leaders invited back for another meeting tomorrow. We have the latest. Plus the high-tax stake exodus. A new study reveals more people moved out of New Jersey than any other state last year. We will tell you where they're headed.And Netflix's Bird Box going viral over a new challenge, but the company is actually having to warn viewers to not make the movie reality. All that and so much more coming up this morning. Former State Department Spokesman, FOX News Contributor, Benson and Harf Host, Marie Harf, Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and FOX News Contributor and The Hill Columnist, Liz Peek. So you want my good news of the morning?MARIE HARF, BENSON AND HARF HOST: Yes.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Sure.MCDOWELL: OK.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Please.MCDOWELL: So, yes, the 10-year Treasury, the yield on the 10-year Treasury, has fallen from the recent high of more than 3.23 percent, almost three and a quarter percent in early November. Yesterday it closed at 2 -- almost 2.66 percent. That's the lowest since January. That ultimately will give ballast to the stock market because treasuries don't look as attractive, they look expensive here. Stocks look cheaper just by the discounted cash flow analysis that you would use to value stocks. So, ultimately, that is good for the stock market.PEEK: Although --MCDOWELL: You can disagree.PEEK: Although. But.MCDOWELL: Liz at the ready with an "although."PEEK: No, I think it's red as a symptom of a slowing growth rate. And I mean I agree with you that the competition from bonds is obviously lessening. But the answer is people are anxious about growth and also that has come in league with the flattening of the yield curve. So, anyway, I don't take that seriously. I think we're in a one-time sort of rare position of this unwinding of the Fed's balance sheet. I think that sort of distorts all of those numbers. But I'm just not sure it's the good news that you think.MCDOWELL: OK. We're going to talk -- what were you going to say?FREEMAN: Well, I would say in the spirit of your comment --MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm. I was trying --FREEMAN: -- I --MCDOWELL: -- I was trying (INAUDIBLE)FREEMAN: Looking at the glasses half full, you know, some of this concern about earning slowdown next year is rooted in the idea that materials' costs are going up. Well, if inflation is going to be milder, then that's going to be less of a problem.MCDOWELL: But --FREEMAN: So, yes, there are benefits to low interest rates and --MCDOWELL: Right. Materials cost.FREEMAN: -- well, the cost.MCDOWELL: And the wage pressures. So, again, there is that balancing act. You don't want a recession to drive down wages.PEEK: I know. Exactly.MCDOWELL: But nevertheless, if it pulls some of the higher cost back a little bit.HARF: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: And then Marie, we'll get into you about what's going on in Washington because we need kind of a --HARF: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- Nancy Pelosi whisper. Not that you are one, but --HARF: I know. I was going to say, "Do you know one?" No, day 13. This - - and no end in sight here and that has to be scaring a lot of people, so - -MCDOWELL: On both sides.HARF: On both sides.MCDOWELL: Absolutely.HARF: Yes, scaring the market.PEEK: Dagen, I think the real good news is stocks are on sale. They're cheap.MCDOWELL: Right. Well, that's what--PEEK: And that's really the bottom line.MCDOWELL: Listen, I sat on this program when the 10-year yield got close to three and quarter percent, I said the last decade, this has been a buying opportunity --PEEK: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- to -- for investors because every time that longer-term interest rates would get to this level, people would jump in and that's exactly what happened, maybe for the reasons that have shaken up the stock market. We're going to talk about all of this. Coming up this morning, Michigan Congressman and House Financial Services Committee Member, Dan Kildee is here. Former Senior Advisor to President George W. Bush, FOX News Contributor, Karl Rove, with his predictions for the New Year down in D.C. Former Arkansas Governor, Former Presidential Candidate, FOX News Contributor, Mike Huckabee, and retired four-star general, FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane. You don't want to miss any of those fine gentlemen.But to our top story this hour, Apple's really historic announcement. The technology giant slashing its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than 15 years. The move is due to slumping you don't want to miss any of those fine gentlemen. To our top stories this hour. The historic announcement. It is flashing the quarterly revenue for the first time in more than 15 years. The company is saying the move is due to slumping iPhone sales in China. AlphaOne Capital Partners Founder Dan Niles predicted trouble for Apple just a couple of months ago right here sitting down with Maria Bartiromo on this program, here's what Dan had to say then.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?DAN NILES, FOUNDER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS: I think you absolutely are. And this is exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of inventory out there. So, if you pick the biggest company in the world, Apple for example, 89 percent inventory growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported. The revenues were up 17 percent. Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well? They're going to have to burn that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.And if you think about, you know, the sales of any consumer item in the fourth market and you think about the big end markets, China stock market's down about 20 percent year to date. India's stock market's down 15 percent year to date. And by the way, their currency's down another 15 percent depreciated year to date. And China's currency is down six to seven. So, I think this holiday season, especially if you're trying to sell abroad -- yes, in the U.S., it's great. Our stock market's up three percent, NASDAQ's up eight percent, you know, that's wonderful.But if you're one of the immerging markets or in Europe, you're looking at a very different picture in terms of how wealthy you feel.BARTIROMO: You know, it's a really good point that you make that Apple has all this inventory because if you've got all this inventory and then you've got these economies that's worsening, who's going to pay a thousand dollars for an iPhone X?NILES: Well, exactly. I mean you look at last year, they had one phone priced above a thousand dollars. This holiday season, they have three phones priced above that and the average selling price, they're trying to boost it by another hundred dollars. The problem is, if you look at smartphone units overall, this will be the first year in history that smartphone units are down year-over-year.(END VIDEOTAPE)MCDOWELL: Since those comments, if you were watching this show that day, Apple shares have lost more than a quarter of their value, down 26 percent. Here now is the founder of Disruptive Tech Research, Lou Basenese, and Altium Wealth Portfolio Manager and Market Strategist, Michael Lee. Good to see both of you, gentlemen. Lou --MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH: Good morning, Dagen.MCDOWELL: -- to you first. Is this of Apple's specific problem or does it really hit on -- are these broad-based problems for all stocks in this country? Global slowdown, slowdown in China, trade tensions that are making matters worse in China, and technology stocks even with Apple that are still overvalue?LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: I'm going to go with yes and yes. I think it is -- it is a big concern for China. It's really the first data point that isn't whitewashed by the Chinese government. That points to a real slowdown in China happening. So, that's why I think the markets are freaking out about it. But it is also an Apple and a smartphone problem. We've really reached -- it's not an innovation problem, it -- we've just reached peak innovation in a smartphone space. We've evolved to the point where every new feature is just an incremental improvement, right? It doesn't really excite people. And that's what's happened here.The newest iPhone's haven't excited enough people to go out and buy them. And, you know, I think it's showing up first in China. But if you read Tim Cook's letter, he also indicated you're seeing problems domestically with the iPhone. Nothing else in Apple's business is a problem, but upgrading to the latest iPhones is.MCDOWELL: Mike, how do you see it?LEE: I think Lou's absolutely right. I think the lifecycle for your average smartphone or iPhone, it's just longer. These phones are fantastic. They keep making them better. At a certain point, they're a victim of their own success. But also, if they want people to be upgrading to these expensive new things year after year, you need something disruptive to come out in the new one, so something that opens with your face versus a swipe your finger, or your passcode, or touch code. Like that really doesn't motivate you to shell out another grand for a phone when your phone already works all right.And let's not forget that Apple got called out for a lot of their upgrades slowing the phones down, as well as the batteries dying early. So, they lowered the price of a replacement battery, so if you still have a six or an eight, you can have that a lot longer if you don't need the latest. Maybe instead of upgrading every year, you upgrade every two year, every two and a half years and that elongation, the upgrade cycle, is really hammering iPhone sales as the number product ties, revenue generator sale.FREEMAN: But this sounds like it really is an innovation problem. You're both saying that in -- the upgrades are incremental and not exciting. Are they missing that big idea, that kind of Steve Jobs visionary products to get them to the next phase of growth?MCDOWELL: Lou?BASENESE: James, I would say -- I would say, listen, who else is innovating, right? I mean is Samsung doing it? What are they missing, I guess, is my question. What's the next big thing? If it's augmented reality, Apple's position there, they're never first to the party, right? They weren't first to mp3 players. They came and dominated with the iPod. They weren't first to wearables, they've now come and dominated with the Apple Watch. Is it mobile payments? They're there with Apple Pay. I think we're in this weird in between where the consumer hasn't figured out what's the next big device I need to solve a problem. So, Apple shouldn't be premature in throwing out a solution into the market early like Google did with Google Glass. It was way too early for an augmented reality device.And I think we're in that -- that position right now with Apple, is they've got to wait. They've got to navigate this interterm period, the in between to figure -- until the market and consumers figure out what they want next.MCDOWELL: Well -- and I'll point out at Facebook, the Oculus is going nowhere fast.BASENESE: Right.MCDOWELL: Let's talk about technology stocks broadly. We were talking about it on this program. That was really one of the major problems that kicked off the selloff and the fall in the first place was overvalued technology stocks. Apple actually wasn't that overvalued compared to other names. But this morning, it is tech stocks leading the global markets lower. So, I want to ask you, Mike, what about the broader implications for this Apple announcement?LEE: So, as a mackle effect to the U.S. economy. I don't think it affects it one iota. The problem with the broader implications for the market though is Apple is such a big component of not only the S&P 500, the Dow, and the NASDAQ. Again, kind of a victim of their own success. So, a bad day for Apple is a bad for all markets.PEEK: So we -- but should we read the Apple as sort of part and parcel of the FAANG stocks and they all move together like they did last year, it seems to me we're sort of windowing out, "This one's doing well, this one's not, Facebook's issues are not the same Google's, the same as Apple. I mean is this a year where we're going to really look at these companies as very individual?LEE: You know, I hope so because it doesn't seem like Amazon has any problems. It seems like Google is a company where the baby's being thrown out with the bathwater so some of these -- these are -- these are really spectacular high-quality companies, but Apple, you have slowing iPhone sales which is a problem. And Facebook, there's a litany of other issues.PEEK: Yes.HARF: Yes.LEE: OK? Beyond the privacy and then that sort of stuff. But also, you know, their advertiser model was slowing, right? So from 40, 50 percent growth, it's 20 to 30 percent growth. Whenever you have a rerating, that punishes the stock price.MCDOWELL: Well -- and part of the problem is, these stocks just broadly were overvalued because of the massive amounts of stimulus that -- not just the Federal Reserve, but the Central Banks pumped into the world markets that it was -- quite frankly, looked like a bubble.LEE: Well --MCDOWELL: It didn't look like '99, 2000 but bubbly, yes.LEE: You know what that --BASENESE: Yes. There was a lot of --LEE: For an institutional --BASENESE: -- rational --there's a lot of irrational buying but now we've see a lot of irrational selling. I think Liz was dead on. This is windowing year. I said this with Charles Payne on Monday that you're going to get, you know, the FAANG stocks, forget it. The FAANG trade is dead. It has been since the middle of last year. You're getting the separating out. Facebook's in a penalty box for all their privacy violations, Netflix is fighting the triple digit valuation and trying to keep up its growth, which is really hard to sustain when they're having to overpay for content and interest rates are rising.So, I do think -- with what Michael was saying, you know, Amazon stands out from the pack. Apple stand outs and those are the two that are going to have to participate for technology to keep leading this market higher.MCDOWELL: And --BASENESE: If they don't, I think we'd struggle.MCDOWELL: In terms of the Fed pulling back all this financial -- this monetary stimulus, I want to ask you one thing, Mike, before we go. So the Fed Fund Futures is a big story in the Journal today. As of yesterday, there is a 91 percent probability that Central Bank policymakers will finish the year with interest rates where they are right now or even below. So, there's a less than 10 percent chance that the Fed hikes in the New Year. Stephanie Pomboy thinks that they stop hiking, stop the reduction in the balance sheet, and maybe even cut rates.LEE: Yes. Look, if they do that, you will turn the U.S. into japan. I severely hope they don't do it. This is short-term volatility in stock markets, OK? I think growth estimates brought it for the S&P 500 and U.S. economy are too low. We're going to come at a three percent GDP this year. OK. The average estimate coming into 2018 was two and a half percent, next year I think it's like 2.2. I think -- I think we'll be in the high two, low threes this year, too.MCDOWELL: Yes. It's really not the Federal Reserve job to keep pouring bourbon in that bowl of punch everybody keeps drinking from, you know, it's been 10 years.PEEK: Funny how you always (INAUDIBLE) bourbon.MCDOWELL: Yes, because I'm from the south. Nobody drinks anything but bourbon. Don't drink clear liquor, so --PEEK: Exactly.MCDOWELL: Thank you, Lou Basenese, Mike Lee.LEE: Thank you, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Coming up, week two of the partial government shutdown. The bran new Congress sworn in today.MCDOWELL: An illegal immigrants charged in the killing of a California police officer. Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Prosecutors charged Gustavo Perez Arriaga with murder in the death of a 33-year-old officer in California. The Mexican national accused of killing Officer Ronil Singh during a traffic stop the day after Christmas. Perez Arriaga was also ordered to undergo a mental evaluation in his first court appearance yesterday. Officer Singh is survived by his wife and five-month-old son.Well, the American man accused of spying in Russia has met with U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman. Paul Whelan, a retired marine, is being held in Moscow on espionage charges and the U.S. is demanding answers about his arrest. Whelan's family claims the Michigan man is innocent and that he was in the country to attend a wedding.Well, a big fight in the media world to tell you about and it's leading to a blackout of local stations just in time for the NFL playoffs. After failing to reach an agreement over content fees, Tribune Media's television stations and WGN America have gone dark for Charter Communications Spectrum customers. Tribune says about six million Spectrum Customers in 24 different local markets have lost access to local T.V. stations owned by Tribune and more than 14 million subscribers nationwide have lost access to WGN. How the blackout could jeopardize broadcast of the NFL playoffs, which began this weekend, and NCAA basketball games. The issue, the amount of fees that Tribune charges for carrying its stations, Dagen. And those are your headlines.MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, passing the gavel, A brand-new Congress. Marie Harf's going to weigh in on this. I can't wait. Will be sworn in today. Nancy Pelosi will take the helm as speaker. What does this all mean for the country in the next two years? Plus The Bird Box challenge goes viral.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDRA BULLOCK: Under no circumstance are you allowed to take off your blindfold.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Why Netflix is now warning fans to keep the blindfolds off in response to this hit movie.MCDOWELL: Take a look at the Dow Futures right now. At 376 point loss on the Dow Futures, weighing heavy on the blue chips is Apple stock this morning. It's about -- represents about roughly 80-point loss of that. I want to correct something really quickly that I said. Apple's stock in the last year is down about eight percent, not up. I think I said up earlier.Moving on, Shutdown Showdown. The partial government shutdown enters day 13 with no deal in sight. President Trump holding firm on border wall funding as Democrats take control of the House today. Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to take the gavel as House Speaker, stands her ground on not providing that wall funding.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: How dangerous it is and why we need a wall. But they know that. Look, look, when they say the wall's immortal, well then you bet -- got to do something about the Vatican because the Vatican has the biggest wall of them all. The wall is immortal. Look at all of the countries that have walls. And they work a hundred percent. It's never going to change.PELOSI: No, nothing. We're talking about border security.SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: Nothing for the wall. But that means it's a nonstarter.PELOSI: Well, we can go through this back and forth.GUTHRIE: Uh-hmm.PELOSI: No. How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Joining me now, Washington Examiner, Commentary Writer, Philip Wegmann. Philip, good to see you. What --PHILIP WEGMANN, COMMENTARY WRITER, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Morning.MCDOWELL: What is the off-ramp for the Republicans and President Trump here? Because Nancy Pelosi clearly is digging in her heels on this. And she is representing the Democratic base on this, particularly the progressive wing. They don't want a dime to President Donald Trump for this. How does it end?WEGMANN: Oh, I think it ends when Nancy Pelosi finally actually picks up the gavel and realizes that she has to decide whether or not this is going to be a Congress that works with the President or doesn't. Right now, she is still thinking about the votes that she needs to become speaker for a second time around. And so I think that the off-ramp here for Republicans is going to have to be that they're not just going to have to compromise from 25 billion down to five billion, which is their initial reduction, I think some sort of DACA for wall deal is ultimately going to be the thing that Nancy Pelosi can go back to her own base and say, "Hey, maybe it's not a wall. Maybe it's a fence. Maybe it's steel slat. But we got permanent extension of DACA or something along those lines that she would be able to stop.MCDOWELL: Marie, that was an idea floated by Lindsey Graham, who --HARF: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- the Senator who met with the President Trump earlier in the week. And the Wall Street Journal followed up on that on its Editorial Page yesterday. What do you say? Is that a deal that can get done?HARF: Possibly. Except for -- and I want to ask Philip his thoughts on this.MCDOWELL: Sure.HARF: Today, Nancy Pelosi -- today, tomorrow, and the next few days, the Democratic House will pass a clean funding bill likely --WEGMANN: Uh-hmm.HARF: -- with no wall funding in it, basically what the Senate passed by unanimous consent before the holidays. If that bill then goes to the President, Philip, then he has to veto that. The shutdown will squarely be on his shoulders if this bill comes to him. Do you think he would veto that and do you think he should? Because then the argument could be made politically that they gave him a bill to open the government and those 800,000 workers not getting paychecks right now, that will be squarely on him. What's your take on that?WEGMANN: Well, I think that what we have is we the same sort of shutdown melodrama that always happens. There's a lot of buzzy headlines and a lot of controversy earlier on. But the stakes on this one are lower. You did mention those workers who are out of work right now, but looking at past shutdowns, we know that furloughed workers eventually get their paychecks. I think that what's happening right now is that you have both Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump circling each other, trying to figure out what they're going to do and to figure out who's going to ultimately shoulder the blame.Pelosi, this time around though, I think that she faces more of a GOP juggernaut that in the years past because McConnell has said repeatedly that he's not going to advance any legislation.MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.WEGMANN: That the President himself doesn't already support. So, President and the Senate are working in tandem and I think that eventually both sides have to come to some sort of compromise or, you know, we'll see this drag on, you know, for weeks on end.MCDOWELL: Well, Philip, then, all the Republicans on it, then granted they have two more seats in the Senate, 53 to 47, Republican to Democrat in the Senate, but as you said, the Majority Leader has said pointblank if the President's going to veto it, we're not going to vote on it.HARF: But they already passed this bill by unanimous consent before the holiday that did not include border funding. So the question is if that bill was good enough for you in December, Mitch McConnell, why is it not now?PEEK: Well, the answer is it wasn't good enough for President Trump and they weren't really anticipating that as a turnaround.MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.HARF: Right.PEEK: It seems to me at some point the congressional -- the Hispanic caucus has to stand up and say $5 billion is worth it to basically --MCDOWELL: The DACA.PEEK: -- resolve the DACA issue.MCDOWELL: Yes.PEEK: And the President, early in his tenure, made an offer like that and then it got confused with politics, and he backed off it.MCDOWELL: Yes.PEEK: Then the Democrats really didn't kind of parry that with an offer. This is either important to the Hispanic caucus and to the Democrats, or it's not. $5 billion and we all know in the past, Chuck Schumer has supported the barrier. In 2009, he made a big speech about how the barrier was important, to secure the border. This is just hypocrisy in my view. And honestly it -- to me, the Democrats have got to come forward at some point and solve this DACA issue in order to justify Hispanics continuing to vote --MCDOWELL: Well --PEEK: -- for Democrats.MCDOWELL: I want -- and Philip, I want to get James Freeman in here.FREEMAN: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: Hypocrisy is synonymous though with politics in this day and age.FREEMAN: Sure. Yes. But it --MCDOWELL: And I read the Wall Street Journal Editorial after George H. W. Bush passed away and you wrote in there about the lousy deal that President Bush brokered with George Mitchell, the Senate Majority Leader back then, and he wrote in his diary, Bush did, I -- in 1989, "I cannot break my 'Read the Lips' pledge. I would be totally destroyed if I did." He broke it, didn't get the spending cuts that he thought he would from the Democrats, and he was one-term president.FREEMAN: Well, it's also -- the situation is on both ends. So you have with the risk to trump of not fulfilling his border promise. You also have the risk for democrats of how do they explain to the immigrant community that denying Trump his victory was more important --PEEK: Thank you. Yes.FREEMAN: -- than allowing people to stay and live in the United States.HARF: That deal's not on the table now though.FREEMAN: It's a -- it's a sale that cannot be made.HARF: That's the deal he's proposing.FREEMAN: So that's why -- I think they will eventually fold in this idea. Their current position, Schumer and Pelosi, are saying that the wall is --MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.FREEMAN: -- unaffordable. This is a party that is currently debating whether to go ahead with their $32 trillion Medicare for All plan. Ridiculous.MCDOWELL: Well -- and I'll point this out, I hate tariffs, Philip, but the tariffs have brought in -- according to President Trump, $11 billion. There's your funding.WEGMANN: Yes. And I think that this is important for us to notice that this five billion is a fraction of what was asked for before. And let's all be honest, That five billion is not actually going to be able to construct the entire wall or whatever sort of semantic term that the administration finally lands on. So, you know, this is a sort of low-end deal, whether or not both sides can agree, is -- it remains to be seen, means it's so polarized at this point and you have Democrats and Republicans on complete opposite sides.MCDOWELL: Part of me, it does bother me. It does just give me a big itch that five billion is not a lot of money when I people say that.HARF: I agree. Totally.MCDOWELL: Because people get so upset about the cost of the Mower Pro, oh my goodness, it's a few -- it's like -- some -- it's in the millions.HARF: Yes.MCDOWELL: It's a lot of money. But so is $5 billion. Anyway, thank you, Philip. Philip Wegmann.WEGMANN: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Good to see you. Coming up, President Trump's vision for the military and Syria. Details on the administration's plan for withdrawing troops overseas as the Acting Chief, Pentagon Chief, takes over. And Apple's shocking announcement. The tech giant's decision to cut its quarterly revenue forecast taking a toll on its stock and the broader markets.MCDOWELL: all on its stock in the broader markets.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo, it's Thursday, January 3rd, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.Apple, shocking the market, the technology giant, slashing its sales guidance for the first time, in more than 15 years, CEO Tim Cook says weakness in China is to blame and the stock is sliding ahead of the open. It's down almost nine percent at the moment.But this raises a whole host of issues for the broad markets as well, and you can see that. This news, taking a toll on technology stocks, Netflix, Facebook, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, all down, but roughly two percent each. Netflix is down almost three percent.It raises an issue about trillion-dollar market cap. Remember Apple was the first to hit that trillion-dollar market cap in the fall? Are these companies sustainable at these levels in these valuations? I want to point out that Apple has lost some $300 billion in market value since peaking at $1 trillion, in early October. It's a huge slide for Apple.And you see the worries about China, and trade, and global growth, weighing on these U.S. Futures. Dow Futures down 376 points at the moment. And move in Apple, set to shave roughly 80 points off the Blue Chips, as we had three -- a little less than three hours before the opening bell.Yesterday, the major market gauges need manage to post slight gains on the first day of trading. But again, we're coming off the worst year for the markets since 2008, the worst December for the Blue Chips, since 1931.Checking the global market action in Europe, we have losses across the board, selling appears to be picking up a little bit of steam, the DAX in Germany now down 1-1/2 percent. In Asia overnight, we have losses across the board, not heavy selling, the Nikkei closed in Japan.Plus, a diplomat disappears. One of North Korea's overseas ambassadors has gone missing. We have the latest on the international mystery.Plus, the high tax state exodus. A new study reveals more people moved out of New Jersey than any other state last year. We'll tell you where they're heading.And Netflix's Bird Box is going viral over a new challenge, but the company is now warning viewers to not make the movie, a reality.To our top story this half hour, spending showdown, President Trump, fighting for funding for the border wall, during yesterday's cabinet meeting, the President, comparing the funds for the wall to U.S. military spending, in places like Afghanistan and Syria.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: This is national security we're talking about. You know, just like we talk about the military, just like we're talking about Syria or Afghanistan, or all of these different places. I mean, we spend in Afghanistan more in one month than what we're talking about for the wall.Think of that, OK? That's another way. We spend in Afghanistan more money than most countries spend, expect a few. OK? It's ridiculous.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: This comes as new Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan is reaffirming his loyalty to President Trump this week. Joining me now, Retired Four-Star General, FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane, General, always a pleasure and an honor to see you and have you on the program. What do you make of President Trump's remarks yesterday?GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Well, first of all, I think he really does have an issue, a national security issue, of dealing with our border, and the fact how open it is, and everybody watching what FOX has been showing for weeks, we'd come to the same conclusion.So, hopefully, they'll get this resolved. In terms of what's taking place overseas, certainly, we've got major issues here, as a result of the President's decision to pull the troops out of Syria. Now, he has refined that decision in terms of what the details are. And he has set some conditions in place.One, he wants to truly finish ISIS, and that has not been done. We've taken the caliphate away from them, Dagen, but we have not finished ISIS, as an entity, in Syria. So that will take some more weeks and possibly, some months to do.Second, he does not want the Syrian Kurds to be attacked and be slaughtered by the Turks. And so, you're going to take some time to ensure that that does not occur.And the third thing is, he does not want the Iranians to be able to establish a land bridge in Syria, for themselves, from Iran to Iraq, through Syria, to Lebanon, to the Mediterranean.So, those are conditions that he's now imposing on the decision, in terms of its implementation.MCDOWELL: Do you think that the original announcement from President Trump then, was rash, because you -- it's -- you know that his military advisers certainly walked him through these items, about not making an immediate withdrawal of our troops out of Syria.So, what does it play here? Did -- because it was a very, kind of, abrupt announcement that really caught everyone off-guard, and now, a softening of that, and certainly a more -- not reasonable, but kind of rational approach?KEANE: Well, I call it a process filed. The National Security Council is the body that the inter-agency gathers to deal with national security issues and present options to the President, with all the risks associated with those options, what's the implication for allies, et cetera, even what is the political liability associated with decisions.That was not done here. It was the decision that was made very quickly and now, with the added information, I think one of the things that happened to the President too, and this is a good thing, he went to Iraq, and he talked to the commanders who were overseeing the operation in Syria.And I'm sure they gave him some detailed information on what has actually taken place with ISIS, today. And what needs to be done to be able to finish them off.So, that added information certainly helped the President to refine the decision in terms of its implementation. The President hasn't reversed his decision, he's refined it.MCDOWELL: Right.KEANE: And I think -- and I totally agree with where he is now. I didn't agree with the decision, initially, for reasons that are very obvious. What he's doing now, would correct the disagreement that I and others have had with him. And I think we're moving in the right direction.MCDOWELL: If you listen to the President over the last couple of years, and even when he was on the campaign trail, two things frustrate him, the lives at risk in these war zones and the amount of money that the United States is spending, whether it's on favorable relationships with our allies or in these countries, in these areas, where our troops are, and what we get in return for that.So, that clearly frustrates him, when he doesn't get answers from the people who work for him.KEANE: Yes, and I -- and I think the burden sharing issue is something that I think he finds very disturbing. I know he starts out a lot of issues and why we're the only one doing this, why aren't others doing it, regardless on what the issue is, whether it's in Europe, the Far East, the Middle East, or whatever.And those are very good questions to ask, and probably no president has asked them as frequently as this one. And as a result of that, there's been some really positive change, certainly what has taken place in NATO, he has stimulated the funding of their defense budgets in a way that we've not seen before.And burden sharing in the Middle East is coming. As a result of his decision to leave Syria, the Saudis have coughed up the money for reconstruction in Northeastern Syria, obviously, as an incentive for the president not to completely walk away. But that is an example of what needs to be done. There needs to be more burden-sharing. He's absolutely right about that.MCDOWELL: I want to move on to this story about the North Korean diplomat who has gone missing, General, South Korean spy agencies are reporting that North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy, went into hiding back in November, and his whereabouts are still unknown. He's not confirmed whether or not he is being held under protection in Italy or another Western country.But this news comes as Kim Jong-un said that in a New Year's address, this week, that he is ready to continue talks with the president of our country, Trump, at any time. General Keane, your reaction?KEANE: Well, first of all, it's episodic that every once in a while North Korean diplomat or North Korean elite defects, and that's obviously what has happened here. It's not a real pattern of behavior, because the danger is so obvious. I mean, the entire family that would be left in North Korea, cousins, any relatives, whatsoever, you know, are clearly at risk, plus, they would hunt him down as long as they possibly could, to kill him and his family.So, it's an act of courage on their part, and probably, an act of desperation also, that he -- that he is in hiding. And likely, they will not find him and because that hasn't happened too frequently. In terms of North Korea and Kim Jong-un, yes, he wants another summit. But, we are at the stalemate with the North Koreans.While there's been some progress, missiles aren't flying over Japan and towards Guam, to be sure, and that's a good thing, and some other 10 general things have happened, like the return of hostages and return of remains, that's very important, certainly, and reconnecting North Koreans and South Korean families in (INAUDIBLE) those are other positive issues.But, on the core issue, Dagen, giving up nuclear weapons, chemical, biological weapons and ballistic missiles, not a single one of those weapons has been disarmed or destroyed. They have not even provided us an inventory of the list of what they have. And that was the first request we made of them, so we're at a stalemate.MCDOWELL: And General, I can't wait for you to come back on, and talk about that, and so much more, as the -- as the New Year 2019, wears on. And I hope you have a wonderful one, but we'll see you soon.KEANE: OK. Take care, Dagen. Thank you.MCDOWELL: Happy New Year, General Jack Keane. Coming up, Garden State exodus, people are running away from New Jersey. We'll tell you where they're going. Plus, blinded by Bird Box, Netflix warning, after a new challenge based on the hit movie, goes viral.MCDOWELL: Dow Futures are deep in the red this morning at 377-point loss on the blue chips right now. Apple a major, major factor. It's not the only factor pulling all these markets down. Apple stock on this rare surprise cut to its sales guidance; Apple stock is now down at nine percent. In fact, that company, remember it was the first to hit that $1 trillion market value in early October, it's lost more than $300 billion in market cap since then. And if you watch this program and heard Dan Nile's interview with Maria Bartiromo in late October, that would have saved you an awful lot of money.Moving on, Senator Bernie Sanders speaking out, following a shocking sexual harassment claims about his campaign. Cheryl Casone has the details. Hey, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, Senator Sanders apologizing just hours after a New York Times report detailed the allegations of sexual harassment that happened during his 2016 presidential campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: So, I was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case. So, I certainly apologized to any woman who thought that she was not treated appropriately and of course, if I run, we will do better next time.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: All right. Well, the report also included numerous complaints that women on that campaign were paid less than the men.Well, Vermont may have the nations smallest population but has become very popular for Americans that want to move. According to United Van Lines' annual mover study, more residents moved into Vermont than out of it in 2018, making it the top inbound destination in the country. Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona filled out the top five. High tax: New Jersey, have the highest percentage of residents leaving the state. New Jersey just gets a bad rap. Maybe it's "The Housewives," I don't know.MCDOWELL: What? Why? Right.CASONE: Those housewives, the shore thing.MCDOWELL: I watched that last night, Cheryl. You're right. It's "The Housewives." I didn't mean to interrupt you.CASONE: No, no, all good. All good. I got one more which is kind of tricky. This is weird. Netflix is telling fans of the new movie "Bird Box," don't do this. Movie star, Sandra Bullock, in the film, guides our kinds named boy and girl for apocalyptic world. They are wearing blindfolds. But some people decided to take part in the bird box challenge in reality. They wear blindfolds to try to navigate things around them. Videos is social media are now showing people stumbling around like in their living room running into walls, all while blindfolded.Netflix had to tweet to this: "Can't believe I have to say this but, please do not hurt yourself with this bird box challenge. We don't know how this started and we appreciate the love but boy and girl have just one wish for 2019, it's not you'd not end up in the hospital due to memes like this." "Bird Box" turned out to be, of course, a big hit. Smashed all the record -- (INAUDIBLE) for Netflix. Taking a look at the stock, it's trading lower in the premarket. There you go, Dagen. The stock is down more than 2-1/2 percent. People are really blindfolding themselves and then hitting walls in their homes and they're taping all of it because they're so smart.MCDOWELL: That's insane. I haven't watched that yet. I can't wait for that. So, James Freeman, high tax state exodus. People are leaving New Jersey more than any other state according to this report from United Van Lines. What say you -- because the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial about -- or wrote a piece about the exodus from the high tax states.FREEMAN: Yes, I'm not moving out of New Jersey. The best housewives and the best of everything -- really, it's the most underrated place in the world. If you forget the burden of government, the taxes, the unfunded liabilities and pension system.MCDOWELL: The roads. The beaches.FREEMAN: No, beaches are beautiful. It's a beautiful place to live. It's wonderful people. It has a very high tax burden, it has too expensive government and we were -- according to the United Van Lines, the most moved up from state in the country last year.PEEK: That's quite an honor.FREEMAN: So, I'm hoping maybe someday, the politicians in Trenton will figure out what's going on.MCDOWELL: Well, maybe Nancy Pelosi could give you a little bit of a lift there and restore the state and local tax deduction. Get rid of that cap.FREEMAN: So, restore the incentive that created this mess.MCDOWELL: I know. What is New Jersey's slogan? It's like, we're not as best as Connecticut. I just made that up. OK. Coming up, saying good bye to the iconic voice of pro-wrestling.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GENE OKERLUND, PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER ANNOUNCER: Tonight, yes, tonight in Los Angeles world championship wrestling unveils a secret weapon that may finally cause rival wrestling organization to crumble.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: The tributes pour in after the death of Mean Gene yesterday. We look back at his legacy.MCDOWELL: Mourning a legend in the wrestling world. Mean Gene Okerlund, anything but mean. Jared Max is here with more. Hey, Jared.JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Hey, Dagen, he played that part so well that he became synonymous with wrestling entertainment. Gene Okerlund died at the age 76. You didn't have to be fan of wrestling to know Mean Gene Okerlund. If you saw wrestling on T.V., you saw Mean Gene; interviewing the biggest characters, from aberrated giant Hulk Hogan, the rowdy Roddy Piper, and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The former WWE superstar tweeted: "We lost a wrestling legend on the microphone, the incomparable Mean Gene Okerlund. RIP legend, strength to you Okerlund ohana and thanks for the awesome memories. #LemmeTellYouSumthinMeanGene," as Hulk Hogan used to say.MCDOWELL: You have to say. You know, like --MAX: Let me tell you something, Mean Gene.MCDOWELL: Yes, thank you. Thank you.MAX: Tough times of late for the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies. Last night, teammates turned against each other. After the Grizzlies lost their third straight, a tenth out of 13 games, the team held a closed-door meeting where it's reported that Omri Casspi and Garrett Temple got to a physical altercation.Oh, hey, get this, NFL T.V. ratings were up this year; five percent better than in 2017. Have you noticed one subject we have not spoken about in months? Players kneeling. We barely see it anymore. The focus has been on exciting football and there's been a lot of it. 46 of the top 50 rated television programs since the season began were NFL games and "Sunday Night Football" is about to become the number one rated program prime time for an eighth consecutive year. I guess you would say the state of the union of the NFL is very strong.MCDOWELL: I can tell you why. Ready?MAX: No kneeling?MCDOWELL: No, it's because -- why do people watch football? It's because of figures who are inspirational and great play on the field. Patrick Mahomes, that's one of the reasons. Somebody like a Drew Brees and how well these guys are playing, what Mahomes has done and he's a joy to watch execute the game. That's my take.PEEK: You mean, it's not Eli Manning?MAX: The Giants' general manager, non-committal on Eli.PEEK: Poor Eli.MAX: Dagen, you bring up a great point. Eli Manning along with guys like Brees and Ben Roethlisberger on their way out the older generation and Patrick Mahomes a great face for the NFL right now -- and Sam Darnold with the Jets too.PEEK: So, have we just not seen kneeling or is it not happening?MAX: There are only a couple players really who are still doing it and we don't -- it's just.PEEK: It's not being reported or --MCDOWELL: Because people don't care anymore. It's like enough of trying to make an issue out of this. It was so few people. Again, just play the game and play it well.MAX: It's been nice to just talk about the game.MCDOWELL: Right. Exactly. But Mean Gene Okerlund, do it again. Let me tell you something Mean Gene.MAX: Let me tell you something, Mean Gene.MCDOWELL: Thank you, Jared. Jared Max, sports reports. We'll be right back. Apple, we're on watch.MCDOWELL: Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, January 3rd.

Senators Propose New 'Office' to Protect Technology Supply ChainsInsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.January 11, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 713 wordsByline: Kate Patrick, InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.BodyJan. 11--After dozens of supply chain data breaches and growing fears that the Chinese government is compromising technology supply chains, senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) proposed a new "Office of Critical Technology and Security" to coordinate technology supply chain security efforts last week.According to the bill establishing the office, the office director will report directly to the president, and the office's primary goal will be to "stop the transfer of critical emerging, foundational, and dual-use technologies to countries that pose a national security risk."In other words, the bill could potentially upend U.S. tech companies' supply chains by stopping them from working with Chinese firms that the U.S. government deem national security risks, but doesn't specify how it plans to implement this goal.The bill also seeks to "protect and enforce intellectual property rights" and "develop a strategy to inform the private sector about critical supply chain risks."All of the bills goals rely on the "coordination" of various government agencies sharing information to better protect technology supply chains -- including the National Council of Economic Advisors, the United States Trade Representative, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).James Rice, deputy director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for Transportation and Logistics, told InsideSources he's not sure that's a feasible goal."It's good that there will be an agency taking the lead to counter foreign government efforts attempting to steal government intellectual property," he said in an email, "[but] of course, it is not clear that our government agencies will actually coordinate/share. They are notorious for collaborating when it comes to receiving information but not when it means sharing."Ultimately, though, Rice said he isn't sure a new layer of bureaucracy for dealing with technology supply chains will be very effective, given there are already many private sector-led efforts to improve supply chain security.For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) spearheads similar efforts, as does the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC), which just launched a new technology supply chain security initiative this week, the "Know Your Risk, Raise Your Shield" campaign.The campaign provides meaningful tips and educational videos to help the private sector protect their technology supply chains, and is the NCSC's response to a July 2018 report that found software and technology supply chains are increasingly targeted by foreign governments and corporations.A new office with vaguely outlined duties like "protect IPR" and "develop a strategy to inform the private sector about critical technology supply chain risks" probably won't accomplish much, Rice said."It's not clear how a government agency will be effective at preventing IP theft and technological sabotage against companies," he said. "The intent is good but I don't see how they could practically do that -- the greatest companies on earth are plagued by cyber-threats and a government bureaucracy doesn't strike me as being more effective than those company efforts."Even the DOD, which is considered to be the most effective at cybersecurity efforts and supply chain security, isn't foolproof, and cybersecurity experts say all federal agencies -- including the DOD -- struggle to maintain effective cybersecurity standards.A September 2018 study from the DOD found that the defense industry's manufacturing and supply chains are heavily reliant on China largely due to market factors, so the idea that a new "Office of Critical Technology and Security" will be able to break up defense supply chains in the name of national security is overly ambitious.To counteract the problem with supply chains, Rice said "some might argue that our government ought to be proactive and explore vulnerabilities of other government's systems. Of course, this would not be written or proposed in a bill."Follow Kate on Twitter___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

The danger of man playing at being GodCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 3, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1475 wordsBody Laura Oliva - La Nación (Argentina) @LANACION  Two months ago, a Chinese scientist named He Jiankui announced to the world that he had created the first two human beings immune to HIV and able to transmit that immunity to their offspring, and thus inaugurate a kind of new human species, one different from the rest of the world. the mortals. The announcement was far from reaping the approval of the scientific community. His supposed achievement was described as irresponsible and triggered ethical debates and reflections. It also ignited multiple alarms, showing that the speed with which science advances leaves enormous gaps in regulatory terms, and places scientists in the position of deciding whether everything that can be done has to be done. The scandal caused by the Chinese scientist - dismissed from the University of Science and Technology of the South (China), where he worked, and currently investigated judicially by the Chinese Government - shows how far things have come today. And is that from the development of a simple and inexpensive genetic editing technique called Crispr (2012), the manipulation of the genes of any cell has become a simple procedure and available to many. This opens up many possibilities, some very controversial and that could substantially modify the course of human life as we have known it up to now. Other methods of gene editing existed before Crispr, but they were more complex and expensive. This method, on the other hand, allows to alter or eliminate a specific DNA sequence by means of an enzyme that locates and marks the segment to be modified or removed. The procedure is so simple that many compare it with a text editor. However, as it is a tool in the development phase, the world scientific community considers that the conditions for an experiment such as He's do not exist. The truth is that, although six years have passed since the creation of this method, not all the necessary debates have yet been held about what are the limits that it is not convenient to transfer. But the hypothetical existence of a code of ethics that regulates the uses of Crispr would have been enough to stop He Jiankui? In what way could improper applications be avoided, with harmful effects for humanity? From the manipulation of the genetic code of a cell, today it can be achieved, and, in fact, it is done, that a plant species becomes resistant to a type of fungus or that an insect does not transmit a disease. It is also possible that, by means of gene therapies, certain diseases caused by the alteration of a gene are treated. But, at the same time, other more debatable possibilities are opened up and rejected by a large part of the scientific community, such as the eugenic variant: thanks to this technique it is possible to sweep imperfections, erase diseases or provide an individual with special characteristics that place them on top of the rest. The potential is so disturbing and its effects in the future so uncertain that in 2016 the then director of National Intelligence of EE. UU., James Clapper, included the genetic edition in the list of potential weapons of mass destruction. Among scientists there is consensus regarding the genetic editing of the cells of a certain organ, called somatic, whose modification is not transmissible to the offspring of that individual, as a technique of great potential for the cure of diseases. On the other hand, the modification of cells of a human embryo or of ovules or spermatozoa that later give rise to an embryo, called germ cells, does not generate the same agreement; among other reasons, because it is unknown if this type of modification could cause, in the future, undesired effects. But what is known is that these alterations would be transmissible to the followinggenerations of that individual, which would turn him and his offspring into beings different from the rest of the human species. In any case, today there are different institutions that make editions in the germ line, although without the subsequent implantation in a uterus. The case of He Jiankui's experiment constitutes an exception to the rule. According to his statements, the Chinese scientist modified the DNA of two twins, Lulu and Nana, daughters of a healthy mother and father carrying HIV, to make them immune to the disease. The He affair falls within the framework of a major geopolitical dispute: the rivalry between the United States and China, whose effects are also felt in the scientific field. However, those who have closely followed the issue claim that the serious misstep given by the Chinese scientist is due to three causes: serious flaws in the research protocol, the absence of controls and an excessive personal ego. An irresponsible act "I do not think it is appropriate to modify genetic information that can be transmitted to offspring," says Alberto Kornblihtt, full professor at the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires. most of them carrying parents generate healthy and diseased embryos, a preimplantation genetic diagnosis is enough to identify healthy ones and reimplant only those in the womb of the pregnant woman, nor do I agree with the use of gene editing to create genetic variants of humans with properties that are different from those of the rest and that are heritable, be they cosmetic or improvement of the species, for example a resistance to a certain infection.This is called enhancement, improvement, of the species and I am radically opposed ". The Spanish scientist Lluis Montoliu, an international reference in the field of genetic publishing, believes that, from this technique, there are two types of laboratories in the world: those that already use Crispr and those that will use Crispr. Santiago Miriuka, a physician and researcher, heads a team at the Instituto Fleni that investigates heart disease through gene editing. It uses a type of stem cells called pluripotent, which have the ability to give rise to any cell type of an organism. The specialist recognizes that with Crispr the team's research possibilities were broadened: "If you have this technique in the laboratory, you can speed up the work and answer questions that otherwise could not or would be more difficult to answer. Other methods, but this one is simpler ... Of course, the application in human organisms is quite novel, and as such it has to follow a process.Clinical studies are very recent, and there will be ten or fifteen in the whole world, "Miriuka explains. With him agrees Jorge Dotto, geneticist and director of the National Registry of Genetic Data of Argentina -which depends on the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights-, who says: "We will have to fine tune about what uses we are going to give. The limit always has to be the responsible use of the tool, we do not have to play at being God. " More than 120 scholars from the Chinese scientific community said in a public statement that "any attempt" to make changes in human embryos through genetic modifications is "crazy" and that giving birth to these babies carries "a high risk." Anyway, warns Dotto, there's always going to be someone, like He Jiankui, who wants to cross the boundaries. "The outlook is risky," says Miriuka, "because there are no limits or specific sanctions, it is necessary to reach a scientific and political consensus that sets certain guidelines, without losing sight of the fact that science will always be ahead of legislation." And he adds that if he were consulted for those guidelines, "I wouldEmphasis on one aspect: & # 8216; security, security & safety & # 8217 ;. Until I am certain that it will not be harmful to the individual and the rest of his progeny, it should not be applied. "For his part, Kornblihtt would emphasize three axes:" First, in the unpredictability of negative consequences, including in the generations following those of the individual edited. Then in the negative aspects at the level of social equity of an enhancement reserved only for the most affluent. And, finally, in the incorrectness of the exacerbation of genetic determinism as the axis of paternity. "Most experts in the field emphasize that the progress in genetic manipulation in recent years is surpassing the little global and national legislation that exists , hence the urgency to draw the limits as soon as possible. The philosopher Julian Savulescu, director of the Center Uehiro for Practical Ethics of the University of Oxford (United Kingdom), warned in an interview with El País that, otherwise, "it is going to it is impossible to avoid the existence of a black market for genetic publishing. People will want a perfect child and will be willing to pay to have it. It may be the beginning of a black market of perfection.

TECH, MEDIA & TELECOM SECTOR REVIEW: GVC Beats Consensus, Paddy LagsLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsMarch 8, 2019 Friday 8:10 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 1625 wordsBody After heavy earnings weeks for publishers and broadcasters, the early days of March saw gambling companies GVC Holdings and Paddy Power Betfair take their turn to report results.GVC boosted its 2018 dividend by 16% to 32 pence Tuesday after underlying profit and revenue both jumped following its Ladbrokes Coral Group acquisition. In 2018, net gaming revenue more than tripled to GBP2.98 billion from GBP815.9 million the year before, helped by GVC's GBP3.2 billion acquisition of peer Ladbrokes Coral in March 2018.However, pretax loss improved modestly to GBP18.9 million from GBP22.6 million the year prior, due to a sharp rise in exceptional administrative costs to GBP453.5 million from GBP173.6 million in 2017.Underlying pretax profit - excluding one-off costs - nearly tripled to GBP434.6 million from GBP151.0 million the year prior. Proforma underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation widened 13% to GBP755.3 million from GBP666.5 million the year prior. The underlying Ebitda figure for 2018 was slightly ahead of the GBP750.1 million consensus forecast by analysts."Excellent operational execution, effective marketing and a good World Cup helped both the legacy GVC and the acquired Ladbrokes Coral businesses perform ahead of expectations and materially ahead of the market," said Kenneth Alexander, GVC's chief executive officer.On Wednesday, Alexander and GVC Chair Lee Feldman sold 2.1 million and 900,000 shares in the company, respectively, for a combined total of GBP19.2 million. Following this transaction, Alexander still has 666,666 shares, representing an 0.1% stake in GVC. In combination with Alexander's existing share plan awards, he has 1.2 million shares in total including the 313,333 shares owned by his wife. Meanwhile, Feldman retains 287,408 shares and has no existing share plan awards.Alexander said: "We have both held large personal shareholdings in GVC for a long time and continue to do so. Both of us remain fully committed to GVC and, whilst I continue to have the support of our shareholders, I'm here for the long term and at the very least I have a current plan that will take three plus years to accomplish."Also on Wednesday, peer Paddy Power proposed a name change to Flutter Entertainment, with consumer-facing brands remaining unchanged, after annual earnings came in both below its own guidance and consensus.The bookmaker's revenue rose 7.3% to GBP1.87 billion, driven by increased investment in new growth opportunities. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by 9%.Paddy Power delivered GBP451 million of underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization in 2018, 4.7% lower than GBP473.2 million the prior year, primarily as a result of investment in the US sports betting.In turn, US operations revenue in 2018 jumped by three quarters to GBP191 million following the merger of Betfair US with FanDuel in July last year. In its own guidance, the company had said it would deliver Ebitda of between GBP465 million and GBP480 million, while the market's consensus forecast stood at GBP497 million."The opening of the US online sports betting market has the potential to be the most significant development to occur within the sector since the advent of online betting. Rather than announcing our plans, we have moved quickly to give ourselves the best chance to win in that market," said Peter Jackson, chief executive of Paddy Power.Among the publishers, Pearson decided to restructure its credit facilities, while Daily Mail & General Trust offered cash and share returns for its shareholders from a stake sale in Euromoney Institutional Investor.Pearson unit, Pearson Funding Five, launched a tender offer for up to EUR75 million of its EUR500 million 1.875% notes due 2021, of which EUR250 million currently remain outstanding.The FTSE 100-listed publisher said the transaction seeks to extend the maturity of its debt by extending the maturity of the revolving credit facility to 2024 from 2021 and reducing the bond debt maturing in 2021."These transactions, together with the improvement of our credit rating outlook by Moody's to stable this week, mark further progress in the strengthening of our balance sheet, which has seen us reduce bond debt by over USD2.5 billion since January 2017," said Coram Williams, Pearson's chief financial officer.On Monday, Moody's Investors Service changed the outlook on Pearson to stable from negative and affirmed its Baa2 senior unsecured ratings. The changes reflect Pearson's "healthy credit metrics" driven by its conservative balance sheet management in a challenged revenue growth environment, Moody's said. The owner of Daily Mail newspaper, DMGT, said the shareholding of the family of Lord Rothermere will increase to 36% from 24% because it will not take part in its proposed Euromoney share return, and will only participate partially in the DMGT share reduction and associated GBP200 million cash return.The move came after DMGT confirmed that it was considering selling its remaining 49% interest in Euromoney and returning the direct Euromoney shares to DMGT shareholders, plus GBP200 million in cash, together worth about GBP896 million.Under the proposed distributions, Rothermere Continuation Ltd and Rothermere Investments Ltd shareholders will receive GBP17 million in aggregate in cash. This is 65% less than the amount they would have received had they participated fully in the cash distribution. Also, GBP17 million is 92% less than the value they would have received if had participated fully in all the proposed distributions.Meanwhile, DMGT said each of its A share holder will receive 0.19933 Euromoney share, plus 68.13p in cash. The company said the number of its A shares will be reduced as part of the capital distributions, on the basis of a reduction of 0.46409 of a share for each existing A share.The company said its voting ordinary shares won't participate in any of these transactions.On Thursday, the market was presented with strong results from Informa, which reported a 35% jump in revenue to GBP2.37 billion from GBP1.76 billion a year ago. This led to pretax profit rising 5.2% to GBP282.1 million year-on-year.Therefore, the company said it is in a "good position" to manage macro-economic cycles including the current volatility due to Brexit and US-China tensions."In 2019, our focus is on continuing Performance & Growth as we consolidate our market positions and further reduce complexity. This will enable us to make the most of our increased operating scale and industry specialisation, creating attractive opportunities for incremental growth and returns," said Stephen Carter, chief executive of Informa.Moving to telecoms, Vodafone raised GBP3.44 billion through the issue of mandatory convertible bonds to fund the acquisition of European assets of US cable television provider Liberty Global.In May, Vodafone announced a deal which will see it acquire the "highly complementary" operations of Liberty Global in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania for an enterprise value of EUR18.4 billion.The sterling denominated bonds are to be issued in two tranches maturing no later than March 2021 and 2022 respectively, with the initial conversion price to be announced by Vodafone after the market close on Friday.The number of shares into which the bonds are convertible are expected to represent 9.8% of Vodafone's current share capital.Outside the UK, South Africa's MTN Group cut its final dividend Thursday despite its 2018 results coming in ahead of its targeted growth expectations.In 2018, pretax profit widened 57% to ZAR15.01 billion from ZAR9.57 billion the year prior, after revenue rose 1.3% to ZAR134.56 billion from ZAR132.87 billion.Against its medium-term target of upper-single-digit growth in group service revenue, MTN said it delivered a 10.7% increase in constant currency terms. This growth was led by 17.2% increase in MTN Nigeria, 23.0% rise in MTN Ghana and 4.2% improvement in MTN South Africa, the company explained. Looking ahead, MTN Chief Executive Officer Rob Shuter said: "We continue to benefit from the demographic dividend in the countries in which we operate and, while the markets remain challenging, we continue to target service revenue growth ahead of inflation."On the political front, China said the US allegations against Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, are a "deliberate political move to bring them down".Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in a press conference Friday suggested the Chinese government is endorsing Huawei's move, announced Thursday, to sue the US government to challenge a law banning government agencies from using the company's products over security concerns. Meng, who was arrested in Canada in December at Washington's request, has also sued Canadian authorities for allegedly breaching her constitutional rights.The US accuses Meng, Huawei, a US subsidiary and telecom equipment seller Skycom of committing bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges are linked to possible violations of US sanctions against Iran.In January, the US in a separate case charged Huawei with wire fraud, obstruction of justice and conspiring to steal trade secrets from US carrier T-Mobile.Washington is also pushing back against China's technological expansion by asking that other countries refuse to adopt Huawei's 5G infrastructure, which Washington says poses security threats.Looking ahead to next week, Tuesday has full-year results from gambling technology company 888 Holdings and IT services provider Computacenter, followed by annual results from cybersecurity firm Avast on Wednesday.Load-Date: March 9, 2019End of Document

Complex fortune grows among the world's most valuable start-upCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 30, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 642 wordsBody       Software engineer Zhang Yiming produced applications to share jokes before focusing on news aggregation. This turnaround turned out to be profitable.  The founder of Bytedance, Zhang Yiming, 35, has a net worth of about $ 13 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which makes him the ninth richest person in China and one of the fastest in modern times to accumulate a huge fortune. The company, founded in 2012, has more than one billion active monthly users in eight mobile applications, including a news aggregator powered by artificial intelligence and a video sharing platform.  Zhang is Asia's youngest self-worth billionaire in the Bloomberg index, which monitors the 500 richest people in the world. Its rapid accumulation of wealth is a sign that China has not lost its talent to create founders of extremely wealthy companies despite the slowing economy. It also helps explain why the authorities seem to be taking a more tolerant stance toward a corporate structure favored by the country's technology moguls, most of whom have opted to open up their companies' capital abroad.  Zhang's fortune is more difficult to calculate than the founders of Baidu and Tencent Holdings, in part because his company is not yet traded on the stock exchange. It is also difficult because Bytedance is structured in the same way as these two technology giants - a complicated property system known as a variable interest entity (VIE).  Of the 44 Chinese magnates on the Bloomberg wealth index, eight are technology entrepreneurs with VIE listed outside China. The combined net worth of billionaires exceeded $ 150 billion as of March 21, and their holdings were not publicly known before the companies asked the regulators to open capital in New York or Hong Kong.  The VIE were never formally defended by the Chinese government. But in recognition of their importance, the authorities will allow the VIE to open capital in the country, allowing them to be traded on a new technology-focused stock exchange, due to be launched in the coming months. Complex structure Bytedance is, for the time being, a closed-end VIE with a complex structure that involves layers of holdings.  Its main unit, Jinri Toutiao, belongs to Zhang and senior vice president of Bytedance, Zhang Lidong, through a holding company registered in Beijing, according to China's National Business Credit Information Disclosure System. Zhang has pledged his 98.8% stake to another Beijing company, which in turn is owned by a company registered in Hong Kong. This entity, in which Zhang is director, belongs to a company registered in the Cayman Islands. Officers will not be disclosed unless there is a listing prospectus.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index calculated Zhang's net worth by estimating its stake to be 65% and giving the company a valuation of $ 20 billion, a figure provided in 2017 by knowledgeable people. The analysis assumes that their participation has been diluted through funding rounds.  It is said that Bytedance was valued at $ 75 billion by the end of 2018, which would have made it the most valuable start-up in the world - butthis number was not used in the calculation of net worth because the details were not confirmed.  A spokesman for Bytedance declined to comment on Zhang's assets or ownership structure.  Zhang uses a VIE because Chinese regulations limit foreign investment in more than 30 sectors, including internet, telecommunications and education. The VIE structure - which allows offshore companies to control domestic Chinese companies through contractual arrangements - circumvents these rules and allows, for example, that the Baidu holding company be headquartered overseas (and be traded in the US) while remaining a dominant force in China.  (Original text: World's Most Valuable Startup Is Home to a Complex Fortune) Load-Date: March 30, 2019End of Document

CEIBS MBA Moves Up to #5 in FT RankingsPR NewswireJanuary 27, 2019 Sunday 7:05 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1082 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, Jan. 27, 2019 BodyPR Newswire~ Both MBA & GEMBA Ranked 5th Globally The China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) has consolidated its leading position among global business schools, with its MBA programme moving up a further 3 places to #5 in theFinancial Times'ranking of the world's top 100 full-time MBAs. This is the first time in the school's history that the MBA has been so highly ranked and the first time CEIBS has had two programmes in the top 5. The CEIBS Global EMBA is now also #5 in theFT'sranking of EMBA programmes worldwide.TheFTrankings are widely regarded, in management education circles across the globe, as one of the most rigorous and most authoritative. For 2019, it has ranked the top 5 MBA programmes as Stanford, Harvard, Insead, Wharton and CEIBS. The CEIBS MBA also retains its position as #1 in Asia in theFTrankings and is also ranked #1 in Asia byForbesandBloomberg BusinessWeek."This is a historic and very significant milestone for us and a very good way to start our celebration of the school's 25th anniversary," said CEIBS President Professor Li Mingjun. "It is remarkable what CEIBS has achieved in just 25 years since it was jointly established by the Chinese government and the European Union. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of the entire school, CEIBS' outstanding achievements in recent years are in sharp contrast to widespread concerns about the slowdown of the Chinese economy and trade tensions between China and the US."The efforts of the school's Career Development Centre (CDC) and the power of the CEIBS brand within the business community, have, for example, contributed to MBA graduates' success in landing jobs. An impressive 93% of them were employed three months after graduation, the highest among the top 5 schools in the rankings. After studying at CEIBS, graduates enjoyed an impressive 183% salary increase, also the highest among this year's top five schools."The CEIBS MBA offers an excellent return on the investment our students make in their future. We continue to improve the level of support we provide to ensure that they emerge from our programme better positioned to move ahead in their careers," said Associate Dean and MBA Director Professor Juan Antonio Fernandez. CEIBS is also focused on staying one step ahead of the trends that will impact graduates' careers, adding, for example, Digital Business as a concentration in response to changes in the way the world does commerce. "The CEIBS MBA is the most advanced in the Asia Pacific. We have 22 electives focusing on digital or innovation related topics," added Professor Fernandez.This year'sFTrankings also confirm that CEIBS has done a better job of helping students advance in their careers and achieve the goals they set when enrolling. Alumni have clearly taken note of all these improvements and there has been an increase in the number of graduates who would recommend the CEIBS MBA to others.At the same time, the rankings have reflected improvements in CEIBS' continuous efforts to provide cutting edge research that makes a significant contribution to the field of academia and can also be applied in real life. The school's faculty had 92 articles published in top journals between 2016 and 2018. There is also a strong focus on CSR, which the school's leadership has made a focus at the strategic level of the organisation. For the last graduating class before the rankings were compiled, more than 40 hours of core MBA classes were related to CSR, ethics or social and environmental issues. CEIBS' commitment to diversification in and outside of the classroom was also a factor reflected in the rankings.  Meanwhile there have been other innovations and initiatives that have improved the CEIBS MBA experience even more. For example, CEIBS launched its patented Real Situation Learning Method (RSLM) that has revolutionised the traditional case method of teaching by placingbothstudentsandtop company executives at the centre of face-to-face discussions that typically take place inside the company being analysed. There has also been a renewed focus on China, with new modules added to ensure that students have a solid foundation in understanding how business is done in the world's second largest economy. They are given unparalleled access to major corporations that provide insight into vital economic trends such as the globalisation of Chinese companies, innovation in China and family business succession. This is complemented by student exchange outside China at some of the world's best business schools, along with overseas elective modules (in the US, Japan, Israel, Malaysia and Europe) through which CEIBS provides vital insight into the global economy.  "Having the CEIBS MBA join our Global EMBA in the world's top 5 of their respective rankings, a feat never before accomplished by an Asian business school and by only a handful of global ones, is an indicator that we are moving in the right direction," said CEIBS Vice President and Dean Professor Ding Yuan. "Looking ahead, our focus will continue to be on providing rigorous, world class academic tutelage to those who know the value of a CEIBS education, and on the professional development of business leaders who will have a global impact."About CEIBSChina Europe International Business School (CEIBS) is among the top international business schools in Asia, where it is the only one to have simultaneously made it to theFinancial Times'top 5 list of MBA and EMBA programmes.CEIBS has more than 22,000 alumni from over 80 countries worldwide, and over the last 25 years has provided a broad range of management programmes for more than 150,000 executives both at home and abroad. It also offers a Finance MBA, Hospitality EMBA and a wide range of Executive Education programmes. With a faculty team that has extensive China knowledge and global insight, CEIBS is uniquely equipped to nurture business leaders, at every stage of their careers, preparing them to make a global impact.  An unrivalled China expert, CEIBS is guided by the concept of China Focus, and Global Significance.  This is tangibly reflected in the school's activities and operations at its 5 campuses across 3 continents: Asia, Africa and Europe. CEIBS has campuses in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen in China, as well as Zurich in Switzerland, and Accra in Ghana. View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ceibs-mba-moves-up-to-5-in-ft-rankings-300784809.htmlSOURCE CEIBSCONTACT: Charmaine N.

Natural Health Trends Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Financial ResultsGlobeNewswireFebruary 21, 2019 Thursday 1:05 PM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: EARNINGS RELEASES AND OPERATING RESULTSLength: 2512 wordsBody• Full year net income increased 32% year-over-year to $31.0 million• Full year cash flow from operations increased 12% year-over-year to $29.7 million• Declared special dividend of $0.08 per share for the fourth quarter• Returned $31.5 million to shareholders via dividends in 2018, up 83% year-over-year from $17.2 millionHONG KONG, Feb.  22, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Natural Health Trends Corp. (NASDAQ: NHTC), a leading direct-selling and e-commerce company that markets premium quality personal care, wellness and "quality of life" products under the NHT Global brand, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2018.Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights• Total revenue of $41.6 million decreased 10% compared to $46.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and decreased 12% compared to $47.0 million in the third quarter of 2018. • Revenue from the Company's Hong Kong operations, which represented 86% of total revenue, was $35.8 million, a decrease of 10% compared to $39.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.• Revenue outside of Hong Kong of $5.8 million decreased 10% compared to $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.• Gross profit was $32.8 million compared to $36.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $37.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. As a percent of total revenue, gross profit was 79% compared to 80% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 79% in the third quarter of 2018.• Operating income was $5.7 million compared to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2018. As a percent of total revenue, operating income was 14% compared to 19% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 17% in the third quarter of 2018.• Net income was $5.6 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.5 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, and net income of $7.6 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2018. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a one-time net charge of $12.5 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"). The one-time net charge was due to the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign income and the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is defined below and is reconciled to earnings per diluted share in the table entitled "Reconciliation from earnings per diluted share to Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share."• The number of Active Members1 increased 1% to 97,840 at December 31, 2018, compared to 97,160 at September 30, 2018, and increased 2% compared to 95,670 at December 31, 2017.1    Natural Health Trends defines Active Members as those that have placed at least one product order with the Company during the preceding twelve-month period.Full Year 2018 Financial Highlights• Total revenue of $191.9 million decreased 3% compared to $197.6 million in 2017.• Gross profit was $152.5 million compared to $158.9 million in 2017. As a percent of total revenue, gross profit was 80%, consistent with 2017.• Operating income was $33.7 million compared to $43.1 million in 2017.  As a percent of total revenue, operating income was 18% compared to 22% in 2017.• Net income was $31.0 million, or $2.74 per diluted share, compared to net income of $23.6 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, in 2017. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $3.20 in 2017.Management Commentary"While 2018 was a challenging year, I'm very pleased with the ability of our company and members to navigate the difficult macroeconomic environment," commented Chris Sharng, President of Natural Health Trends Corp. "This unpredictable and challenging operating climate, driven by increased global trade tensions, China's slowing economy and a weaker currency resulted in a decline in revenue. Notably, the Chinese Yuan's depreciation of 10% against the Hong Kong dollar since February essentially made our products more expensive for our Chinese consumers in 2018. Without the impact of the Yuan devaluation, revenue for the full year of 2018 would have been flat with 2017."Mr. Sharng further commented, "While we experienced attractive growth in many global markets and are encouraged by the continuing positive sentiment from our leaders, given the global macroeconomic backdrop and the increased regulatory and media scrutiny in China, we are cautious regarding our performance in 2019 due to the potential impact on our operations from the global trade environment, exchange rate fluctuations, adverse local publicity and the Chinese government's 100-day campaign. As a result of this campaign and consistent with our past strategies and those of peers, we voluntarily decided in January to temporarily suspend our member activities while proactively cooperating with all relevant government agencies to ensure we continue to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws in China. While I am confident this is the best approach to position our Company to successfully operate in the long-term, this suspension of member activities may have a material adverse effect on our business in the near-term. Despite these elements that are beyond our control, we remain focused on geographical expansion opportunities and leader education to further our progress."Corporate DevelopmentThe Company has relocated its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles, California to Hong Kong. The strategic decision was made to align with and further expand the Company's presence in Asia, where the majority of its business is conducted, improve operational efficiency, and provide greater access between leaders, members and the Company.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow• Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.4 million, compared to $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year of 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $29.7 million, compared to $26.6 million in 2017.• Total cash and cash equivalents were $132.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018, up from $132.2 million as of the third quarter of 2018, and down slightly from $135.3 million as of the fourth quarter 2017.• On January 27, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16, as well as a special cash dividend of $0.08 per share on outstanding common stock. The dividends will be payable on March 15, 2019 to stockholders of record as of March 5, 2019.• As of December 31, 2018, $32.0 million of the stock repurchase program previously approved on July 28, 2015 and increased on January 13, 2016 remained available for future purchases, inclusive of related estimated income tax.The Company expects to issue its 2018 audited financial results in March with its Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The financial results are preliminary and the accompanying financial statements have not been audited or have not yet been reviewed by the Company's independent accountants. Significant updates and revisions may be required before the release of the Company's 2018 audited financial results.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasureThe Company included in this release a non-GAAP financial measure, "Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share," which is derived by excluding the one-time net charge resulting from the Tax Act from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of "earnings per diluted share" for both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.Management's exclusion of the one-time net charge in calculating Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is intended to facilitate a more useful period-to-period comparison of the Company's financial results and to provide additional information about the incremental impact of the Tax Act, namely the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign income and the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets to which the Company was subject in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.  This non-GAAP financial measure is supplemental and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.The Company's financial statements provided with this release include a reconciliation of Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to earnings per diluted share.Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Financial Results Conference CallManagement will host a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results today, Thursday, February 21, 2019 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

UK report finds technical risks in Huawei network gearAssociated Press InternationalMarch 28, 2019 Thursday 1:24 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 599 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WriterDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - British cybersecurity inspectors said Thursday they found significant technical issues in Chinese telecom supplier Huawei's software that pose risks for the country's mobile networks.It's the latest salvo in a global battle over Huawei , which the U.S. says could give the Chinese government backdoor access to sensitive data worldwide.The annual update on Huawei Technologies' security said officials are not confident Huawei is up to fixing the problems, pointing out that the company still hasn't done anything to address flaws identified in last year's report.Thursday's report said it's possible to only give "limited assurance" that long-term national security risks from Huawei's involvement in critical British telecom networks can be adequately managed.The U.S. government wants its European allies to ban the company from next-generation mobile networks set to roll out in coming years over fears China's communist leaders could use Huawei gear to carry out cyberespionage.Britain has so far resisted, saying it can manage the risks without resorting to a boycott. The European Union is also leaning toward a similar approach, with the bloc's executive commission avoiding a ban when it released security recommendations for 5G networks earlier this week.Security of superfast 5G mobile networks, which promise to unlock a new wave of innovation, is taking on more urgency as European countries prepare to auction off frequencies to mobile phone companies this year.Thursday's report noted that Britain's cybersecurity authorities did not believe Huawei's defects were a result of "Chinese state interference."Since 2010, Huawei equipment in British networks has been inspected by an evaluation center, which is funded by the Chinese company and, starting in 2014, overseen by a board chaired by a top British cybersecurity official. Other board members include officials from Huawei and Britain's mobile phone companies.The oversight board's report criticized Huawei for making "no material progress" in fixing technical shortcomings noted in last year's report."We understand these concerns and take them very seriously," Huawei said in a statement. The issues that have been identified "provide vital input for the ongoing transformation of our software engineering capabilities," a global effort for which the company in November pledged $2 billion over five years, it said.The oversight board, however, said it hasn't seen anything that gives it confidence Huawei has the capacity to carry out the transformation.One big concern: In 2018 the center found "several hundred issues and vulnerabilities" in Huawei gear that were reported to British mobile companies.Alarmingly, it said attackers who knew of the vulnerabilities and had the right access could potentially exploit them to affect a network's operation, in some cases by causing it stop to operating correctly.The report's findings don't suggest that British mobile networks are more vulnerable than last year, and can be used to flag up issues so phone companies can more effectively mitigate them, it said.The oversight report is separate from a government review of the risks to Britain's 5G telecom equipment supply chains due out this spring, though it is one of the things that review will take into account.Huawei overtook Scandinavian rivals Nokia and Ericsson to become the world's biggest telecom equipment maker because of its reputation for cheap, good quality products.___Follow Kelvin Chan at www.twitter.com/chanman___Follow the AP's coverage of technology at: https://apnews.com/apf-technologyLoad-Date: March 29, 2019End of Document

10 Great Reasons to Buy Apple StockUSNEWS.comMarch 21, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; Stock Market News; Vol.; No.Length: 1223 wordsByline: Wayne DugganHighlight: Apple's iPhone struggles may soon be a distant memory.BodyApple stock's price target is going up.After a rough start to 2019 that included a guidance cut and multiple analyst downgrades, Apple (ticker: AAPL) stock has bounced back and appears to once again be on the right track. Investors appear optimistic about an end to the trade war with China that the company blamed for its guidance cut. Even with            Apple stock up 17 percent already this year, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan recently upgraded AAPL stock to "buy" and raised his price target from $180 to $210. Here are 10 reasons Mohan says investors should be buying Apple stock.Industry trends are positive.One of the major concerns for AAPL investors is the health of the company's iPhone inventory given media reports of price cuts in China. IPhone channel inventories grew by about 4 million units in the fiscal first quarter, according to Bank of America estimates. However, Mohan says inventories likely declined by 4 million units in the month of January alone thanks to price cuts, completely eliminating the first quarter build. The price cuts certainly cost Apple some margin in China. But looking ahead, Mohan says lower inventory levels are a net positive for investors and could help drive iPhone order stability.China price cuts are deceptive.Any time a company cuts prices on a product, investors immediately get concerned about demand. Mohan says Apple has likely been monitoring a couple of key developments in China that have given the company the opportunity to lower prices. First, the U.S. dollar has weakened in 2019 compared to the Chinese yuan, which is a positive for Apple and provides some wiggle room on pricing. Second, China recently announced an aggressive cut to its value added tax. In the past, Apple has taken the opportunity to lower prices and attempt to gain market share following tax cuts.There's an Apple Services opportunity in China.AAPL investors are looking to the company's services segment to pick up the slack as iPhone unit revenue growth flattens. Unfortunately, services revenue growth in China has been a problem for Apple. Mohan says that dynamic may soon change. He says the Chinese government has once again begun approving mobile games after putting gaming approvals on hold throughout most of the second half of 2018. Mohan says newly approved games helped drive 10.7 percent China App Store revenue growth in the first two weeks of February, up from just 4 percent growth in January.Gross profit trends are positive.Year-over-year growth in gross profit dollars for Apple has been an excellent leading indicator for Apple stock over the past five years. After peaking at around 20 percent in late summer of 2018, Apple's gross profit dollar growth took a nosedive along with Apple's share price. However, Mohan says gross profit dollar growth is currently in the process of bottoming at around negative 9 percent in the March quarter and is headed back up to around 15 percent within the next year or so. Mohan says investors can expect significant gross profit dollar growth starting in the second half of 2019.Wall Street is bearish on hardware sales.The bear case against Apple is that hardware sales will drift lower in coming years. However, Mohan says Apple stock seems to be priced as if lower hardware sales will also drag services revenue growth into negative territory as well. He says that scenario is way too pessimistic. Instead, Bank of America projects hardware revenue growth will be mostly flat in coming quarters, while services revenue will grow in the mid-teens. Based on his growth scenario, Mohan assigns roughly $78 per share in value to Apple stock from the hardware business and $116 in per-share value from the Services business.Earnings estimate cuts were too deep.When Apple slashed its guidance to kick off 2019, many Wall Street analysts followed up by cutting their own earnings and revenue estimates for Apple. Mohan says some of these cuts were too deep, especially in the longer term. Bank of America's fiscal 2019 EPS estimate of $11.55 is only slightly above Wall Street consensus. However, Mohan is calling for fiscal 2020 EPS of $13.39 and fiscal 2021 EPS of $16.05, well above consensus estimates of around $13 and $14.50, respectively. Mohan said investors should anticipate meaningful upward earnings estimate revisions for 2020 and 2021.Apple can still gain market share.Apple has a dominant market share in the high-end of the smartphone market. Bank of America estimates Apple has 93.7 percent market share of smartphones priced above $900 and 99.9 percent market share of devices priced more than $1,000. However, Apple has less than 34 percent market share for devices priced in the $500 to $599 price range and just 22.8 percent share of devices below $500. Mohan says falling prices of older iPhone models, such as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models, should soon give Apple quality offerings on the lower end of the price scale.Apple users are extremely loyal.Bank of America estimates Apple has an iPhone user base of around 900 million people worldwide, and Mohan says Apple has extremely high user satisfaction rates. In addition to being satisfied with their iPhones, Mohan says switching operating systems creates potential difficulties in transferring data, preferences and contacts. He predicts iPhone user churn will remain in the low single digits even as competitors roll out new products this year. In a recent survey of 151,000 global smartphone users, Bank of America found much higher loyalty rates for iPhone users than any other leading smartphone.Apple has revenue growth catalysts.Mohan says Apple has multiple incremental revenue growth opportunities coming in the years ahead. In the near term, he says Apple will likely launch both news and video streaming services sometime in 2019. Apple is expected to announce its streaming service at a special event scheduled on March 25. In addition, Mohan says investors should expect Apple to launch new devices (potentially wearables) at some point. Apple users appear to be more willing to try new devices given the high initial adoption rates of recent launches, including the Apple Watch and AirPods.World demographics bode well for user base growth.Global demographics trends suggest Apple could expand its massive user base in the coming years. In particular, Mohan says the rise of the middle class in emerging markets such as China, India, Russia and Brazil has resulted in a huge new segment of the global population with disposable income for the first time. Disposable income per capita in China has been steadily rising for decades. In addition, while smartphone penetration in the U.S. is now around 80 percent, penetration in Brazil and Russia remains below 60 percent. In India, smartphone penetration is only around 25 percent of the population.Why Apple stock is a good buy now.Here are 10 reasons experts say investors should buy AAPL stock:-- Industry trends are positive.-- China price cuts are deceptive.-- There's an Apple Services opportunity in China.-- Gross profit trends are positive.-- Wall Street is bearish on hardware sales.-- Earnings estimate cuts were too deep.-- AAPL can still gain market share.-- Apple users are extremely loyal.-- Apple has revenue growth catalysts.-- World demographics bode well for user base growth.Graphic Picture, (VCG/VCG via Getty Images)Picture, (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Picture, (GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)Picture, (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)Picture, (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Picture, (Getty Images)Picture, (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)Picture, (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Picture, (Chesnot/Getty Images)Picture, (Qi Heng/VCG via Getty Images)Picture, (Getty Images)Picture, (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Load-Date: March 22, 2019End of Document

China became a member of the World Trade Organization in December 2001. Based on nearly two decades of evidence, it's clear that the agreements that allowed China to join fell far short."The rules that underpin the WTO were crafted more than two decades ago, when China was an economic middleweight. At that time, multiple states within the U.S. had economies larger than China's. During the debate on China entering the WTO, many predicted membership would drive China further away from one-party control of government and economics. And China made specific commitments dealing with economic reforms as a precondition of WTO membership. That was the basis on which the Congress granted China normalized trade relations with the U.S., legislation I supported."Today, China is an economic heavyweight, second only to the U.S. and continuing to grow rapidly.

Stanford halts research ties with Huawei amid surveillance controversyThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityFebruary 5, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 856 wordsByline: Nicholas MidlerBodyStanford paused its research partnership with the Chinese telecom conglomerate Huawei in mid-December in light of the U.S. government's warning against potential cybersecurity risks associated with the company.Huawei is the world's largest supplier of the network equipments used by phone and internet companies. Suspected of allowing unauthorized surveillance and espionage by the Chinese government, the company's CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested by Canadian authorities in December for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. Most recently, the U.S. Justice Department filed 23 criminal charges on Jan. 28, including stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile. Huawei denied all allegations, stating that they are "committed to be on the side of our customers when it comes to cyber security and protecting privacy."At Stanford, Huawei is a member of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory's AI Affiliates Program and the Engineering School's SystemX Alliance, a program that brings together Stanford researchers and private corporations to tackle various engineering challenges.According to University spokesperson E.J. Miranda, Stanford "has established a moratorium on new engagements, gifts, affiliate membership fees and other support from Huawei.""We are sensitive to the federal government's concerns about technologies being appropriated by other countries to the detriment of U.S. national security," Miranda added. "Our international engagement is guided by university policies and in compliance with federal regulation."Miranda noted that Stanford will "continue to evaluate legal and regulatory developments" surrounding Huawei in light of the recent indictment, but said the University found "nothing inappropriate" from the University's past collaboration with Huawei.Brian Huang, an industrial contracts officer at Stanford, said that affiliate programs like SAIL and SystemX "are just a window into the current research that's going on at Stanford.""There's no offers of any rights to intellectual property," he said.Huang added that corporate research sponsorship does not automatically translate into licenses of inventions.Nevertheless, the SAIL affiliate program provides companies with "early, facilitated access to research, faculty and students" and "invitations to all retreats, conferences and seminars" in exchange for $200,000 in annual sponsorship fees, according to SAIL's website. Similarly, for $175,000 a year, companies in the SystemX affiliate program can work closely with Stanford researchers on specific projects.The University established the moratorium on collaborations with Huawei at the recommendation of Kathryn Moler, vice provost and dean of research. The Faculty Senate Committee on Research, Provost Persis Drell and President Marc Tessier-Lavigne approved the suggestion, according to Miranda.Stanford's severing of ties follows growing sanctions against Huawei from Western countries and companies. Despite Huawei's denial of any wrongdoing, the European telecom company Vodafone recently announced it would stop purchasing Huawei equipment due to security concerns. Poland arrested a Huawei employee in early January on charges of spying.Additionally, the CFO Meng's arrest has worsened U.S.-China relations already strained by a trade war, with the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang stating that the move indicates "strong political motives and manipulation" from the U.S. government.Huawei's sidelining comes at a time when many countries are planning on upgrading to a 5G cellular network. Huawei sells much of the equipment that would underlie such a shift. Australia banned Huawei from developing a 5G network for the country. Many European companies have also expressed concern about Huawei taking part in their 5G technology.On the collegiate level, University of California at San Diego and Oxford University have suspended research ties with Huawei.U.S. universities are also scrapping Huawei equipment used on campus. The National Defense Authorization Act , which President Trump signed in August, requires schools receiving federal funding not to use products from several blacklisted companies, including Huawei. Steve Eisner, Stanford's director of export compliance, told Reuters that Stanford searched campus for banned devices but didn't find anything requiring removal. Across the Bay, Berkeley had to replace a Huawei video-conferencing system, according to Reuters."The current pause affects only Huawei," Miranda said. "We continue to be committed to international collaboration for the advancement of knowledge."Contact Nicholas Midler at midler 'at' stanford.edu and Daniel Yang at danieljy 'at' stanford.edu.While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

AMBASSADOR SONDLAND'S SPEECH AT ETNO'S 'STATE OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS'States News ServiceJanuary 31, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1983 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Mission to the European Union:Ambassador Sondland Remarks (as prepared) atETNO's State of Digital Communications ConferenceThursday, January 31, 2019BrusselsThank you Phillip for that introduction and to Lise FurhETNO's President and Director Generalfor inviting me to offer remarks today. And of course thank you to Lise's great team, Alessandro and Paolo.I also want to express my deep appreciation to those of you I have met already for your warm welcome to Brusselsthese first seven months have flown by. I am starting to feel at home, in no small part due to the hospitality I have received so far. Too those I haven't yet met, I look forward to building a very fruitful relationship with you and your organizations.When President Trump was gracious enough to honor me with this appointment, I readily accepted. It's a job I wanted, because of the strong policy components and because I truly value the transatlantic relationship and its transformative powers.I came to Brussels first and foremost to advance the interests of the United States and the American people. At the same time, my team and I also seek bold new ways to improve the transatlantic relationship, because it is one of our most important partnerships. Let me say that again. It is one of our most important partnerships.The Transatlantic Relationship is among the deepest, most important relationship the United States has, based on our longstanding cultural and historical ties, the world's largest bilateral trade and investment volume, strong security and defense cooperation, and a (generally) likeminded approach to foreign policy.Most importantly, we share unshakable values and a commitment to free and open societies and markets.While the United States and Europe have had our share of disagreements, these frank conversations are a sign of a mature, interdependent relationship. I am here to assure you: what unites us is far stronger than what divides us.Recalibrating our trade relationship to make it more free and fair is the United States' number one bilateral goal.Both sides have been clear we will work together to ensure we do not unnecessarily diverge on standards and regulations related to emerging technologyincluding those involving cybersecurity.We want to prevent the development of non-tariff barriers that hobble the industries that will define growth in the future, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and Internet of Things (IoT), among others.Today, however, EU standards and technical regulations impact 92% of the value of goods exported here from the United States. I have discussed with Commission officials the EU needs to eliminate market barriers in the form of standards and regulations that disadvantage American producers. This will not only level the playing field, but also encourage innovation in Europe.Global digital innovation matters to the United States. We must ensure proposed legislation in areas such as digital taxation and e-privacy does not damage the growing digital trade relationship enjoyed by our citizens.Policymakers need to update rules and regulations to facilitate continued innovation in our rapidly digitizing economy. However, at a recent Commission conference, discussion focused on what new regulations are needed to "contain" digital innovations in the economya presumption that regulation is always necessary.Premature or excessive regulation of new sectors such as artificial intelligence, and an inability to hit the right balance between protecting data and enabling innovation, would leave Europe technologically behind.As you all know, the attitude in many parts of Brussels is pro-regulation. This philosophy has real consequences for EU businesses, investors, and consumers.Rather than wait for bureaucrats to tell you what is or is not allowed, I would encourage you to tell them what you need to succeed.You must raise your voices proactively and frequently. At the first hint or rumor of a new, innovation-thwarting regulation, you must call out the EU. You must connect with the United States and other like-minded entities, so we can work together to positively influence the outcome.Once we move beyond serious but solvable irritants in our trade relationship, we can increase our focus on the most serious challenge for both of our economies: China.China is obviously one of our top concerns about cybersecurity. China is working to establish itself as a cyber-power through legal frameworks and control over data and networks.China's laws also give us cause for concern. They require its state-owned and private companies to cooperate with and share data with Chinese intelligence and security. These obligations could even extend extraterritorially.China's unchecked influence over its domestic companies will increase its reach as those companies expand their operations globally.China's capacity to intercept data is another concern. China Telecom has repeatedly re-routed internet traffic through China since 2010. In 2016 and 2017, China Telecom re-routed internet traffic from Canada, the United States, and Europe through China.If China is able to do this now, imagine what it could do if builds out the global 5G infrastructure.Speaking of 5G, increased connectivity of course brings increased vulnerability. Given how interconnected we are and how much we depend upon each other, vulnerability of our allies' networks becomes a security threat to the United States.Leading the development of AI, big data and autonomous vehicles, among other areas, will be vital to our collective security and economic prosperity.EU policy makers are becoming aware of the challenges and opportunities posed by the digitization of the economy. European companies' share of global telecoms sector profit is falling, but a turnaround is possible.As ETNO has said, Europe needs to lead in strategic areas including Internet of Things technology and the development of pervasive high-speed networks using 5G.The United States has made the security of networks and services a priority, and this has implications for 5G. 5G deployment is an attractive target for foreign adversaries and malicious cyber actors.The United States is active on this issue to address very real security concerns, not to advance our economic interests. The firms who would benefit most from greater focus on 5G security would be industry leaders in telecom networking equipment from Europe, such as Ericsson and Nokia.We are at a key point in the transition from 4G to 5G networks. The infrastructure that we put in place now will be used for decades to come.If the technology used to build 5G networks contains cybersecurity and privacy vulnerabilities they will weaken our collective security.I can't overemphasize this point. This is not a decision about price or quality. This is a decision about whether or not to allow a malign actor to take control of your national telecommunications system at a time and for reasons of their choosing. Would you ever put a price on national security?Because let me be clearthat is exactly what this comes down to. China uses seemingly attractive pricing to get a foot in the door. And then, to quote Hotel California, they might check out, but they will never leave.That is not a risk any reasonable buyer should be willing to take.Instead, if price truly is a concern, cut a better deal with the good guys. You have options, so make them earn your business. Just don't take the poison pill!While, the United States is committed to an open investment environment. We cannot ignore real cybersecurity threats.Recognizing the threats, the United States is reaching out to its allies to collaborate on best practices.We have taken steps to strengthen our foreign investment reviews for strategic risks, bar federal agencies from procuring certain components and services from high-risk suppliers, and recommended certain mobile carriers not receive licenses because of the potential they could share date with the Chinese government.The EU needs to take concrete actions to strengthen cybersecurity as well. An EU FDI screening framework is a positive step, but the EU must take others as well to address threats from external malign actors.Turning more directly toward the future, I am an AI optimist. The economic consequences of this groundbreaking technology will be enormous.But AI is a global race. As in the past, the United States and the EU must collaborate to create the standards and ethical groundwork on which AI can flourish appropriately.U.S.-EU collaboration combined with smart regulation will give us a competitive advantage. Conversely, premature or overly restrictive regulation of nascent technologies will kill innovation...and clear the field for China to set AI standards.While the EU says it want collaboration on AIciting historic U.S.-EU space science collaboration as a modelproposed EU funding mechanisms would restrict eligibility to EU-owned and financed organizations, punishing businesses with U.S. partners or collaborators.I understand ETNO launched an Artificial Intelligence Task Force. This will complement and enrich the work of the EU High-Level Working Group on AI and their published Guideline on Ethical AI. Let's continue the public-private dialogue on this important topic.The United States and the EU are clearly at our best when we cooperate. As we work together on emerging technologies, we must jointly promote:CompetitionLight-touch and flexible regulatory policies that are technology neutralIndustry stakeholder participationThe free flow of dataIndustry-led standards developmentProtection of intellectual propertyWe must also work towards interoperable solutions, as well as preventing conflicting laws and fragmentation of the internet. We must also avoid a patchwork of uncoordinated national laws that slow innovation and growth of emerging tech.Let's get beyond simplistic formulations privacy and security are not mutually exclusive. We can have free flows of data with strong privacy and cybersecurity.Maintaining public trust in digital goods and services is vital to the success of the digital economy. Constant technological disruptionAI, Internet of Things, blockchain technologyrequires re-thinking best practices to advance consumer trust. Otherwise, the enormous economic value of new technologies is lost if no one feels safe going online.Europe faces a choice regarding its digital future; the rest of the world is not waiting for Europe. ETNO's own excellent report bravely states the facts on the ground: "If [EU] institutions do not keep up with digitization, the benefits will not be reaped at least not in Europe."So, as ETNO has said before, this is an inflection point for Europeans. I see three options. European technology can rise, fall or remain at the status quo, trapped by regulations that stifles creativity and leads to irrelevance.So how can ETNO push for Europe to rise? Here are my four recommendations:First, prioritize innovation. Innovation is the pathway to global competitiveness. The future is brightest for innovative organizations.Second, stop asking regulators to punish your competitors. All the regulations in the world will not make a difference if Europe fails to innovate.Third, prepare to work with a new European Commission and new European Parliament.. Reach out to them early AND often.Fourth, accept that if the EU refuses to budge, innovation will skip over Europe. The United States will still innovate, but less than we might have achieved together. It is in our interest to do this together. And I think this is an important message to end on the United States and EU can still work together to address critical, common global challenges and to enable a digital future that will advance the prosperity of all our citizens.By USEU Mission | 31 January, 2019Load-Date: February 1, 2019End of Document

Huawei founder dismisses espionage allegations as ‘politically motivated'FierceWirelessFebruary 19, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 593 wordsByline: Matt KapkoHighlight: Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei has addressed many of the controversies facing the Chinese company and remains defiantly optimistic about its ability to overcome myriad challenges of late. “There's no way the [United States] can crush us,” he said in an interview with the BBC.BodyHuawei founder Ren Zhengfei addressed many of the controversies facing the Chinese company and remains defiantly optimistic about its ability to overcome myriad challenges of late. “There's no way the [United States] can crush us,” he said in an interview with the BBC.“The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit,” he said.The reclusive billionaire last month spoke with foreign media for the first time since 2015 to vehemently deny charges of espionage that are weighing heavily on the company and its prospects. Ren's interview with the BBC marks a new strategy of sorts wherein he directly addressed the recent arrest of his daughter, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, and called into question the motivations behind the growing criticism of his company.Meng's arrest in Vancouver at the request of U.S. officials and the subsequent 23 charges leveled against her and Huawei for money laundering, bank fraud and stealing trade secrets, are politically motivated and without merit, Ren told the BBC. “I object to what the [United States] has done. This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable.” He called it a combative method on the part of the U.S. government and said it will now have to be settled in court.RELATED: Huawei's greatest critic lays out his case against the companyRen also framed the spying allegations and growing number of countries opting to ban Huawei equipment from mobile networks as a battle between the East and West. “If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North goes dark, there is still the South,” he told the BBC. “America doesn't represent the world. America only represents a portion of the world.”For almost a decade, U.S. security officials have warned network operators that Huawei's equipment could be used to spy on Americans and U.S. allies. As the company continues to defend itself it now faces the prospect of an executive order from President Donald Trump that would ban the company's equipment from America's wireless networks. The administration wants to get the directive signed before MWC Barcelona kicks off next week, according to Politico.Although Chinese companies are required to “support, cooperate with and collaborate in national intelligence work,” according to the BBC, Ren said the Chinese government and Huawei have not installed any backdoors. “We're not going to risk the disgust of our country and of our customers all over the world because of something like this,” he said. “Our company will never undertake any spying activities. If we have any such actions then I'll shut the company down.”Ren's interview was broadcast just as a new report from The Information detailed Huawei's efforts to steal trade secrets including details that a supplier has about the heart rate sensor that Apple uses in the Apple Watch. In charges leveled against the company, the U.S. Justice Department alleges that Huawei has a formal program to reward employees for stealing information, according to the new report.With MWC Barcelona, the industry's largest annual gathering, getting underway in less than a week, Huawei's challenges and prospects are certain to be a hot topic. The company is scheduled to hold media briefings and executives will be on stage for panels throughout the event. Leading up to the conference, Huawei announced that it launched the first 5G digital indoor system in Shanghai's Hongqiao Railway Station with China Mobile Shanghai.Load-Date: February 25, 2019End of Document

'There's no way the US can crush us': Huawei's founder issued a defiant message to Trump's administrationBusiness Insider USFebruary 19, 2019 Tuesday 05:23 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 615 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: Huawei founder Ren Zengfei's daughter and CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada in December last year.BodyAP Photo/Vincent Yu• Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei gave a rare interview to the BBC on Monday, declaring that there's "no way the US can crush us."• Ren's daughter, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada in December last year.• He said the arrest was "politically motivated" and "is not acceptable."• The defiant tone of the interview marks a change in rhetoric. In January, Ren tried to ease tensions between the US and Huawei, saying Donald Trump was "a great president."The founder of the Chinese phone giant at the heart of a political fight with the US told the BBC that there's "no way the US can crush us."Ren Zhengfei is the founder of Huawei, a company which has come under intense fire from the US in recent months amid fears it is a backdoor for Chinese surveillance and is involved in corporate skullduggery.In December 2018, the company's CFO and Ren's daughter, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada at the request of the US. Since then the US has accused Meng of breaking sanctions, and the company as a whole of stealing trade secrets. Huawei and Meng deny any wrongdoing.The US has long frozen Huawei out of its own phone market, citing concerns that the company could act as a backdoor for the Chinese government to spy on US citizens. More recently, the US has been lobbying its allies to forego using any of Huawei's equipment in setting up 5G networks.Read more: Mike Pompeo is bringing the hammer down on Huawei on his European tourRen downplayed the power the US had to torpedo Huawei's business. "There's no way the US can crush us," he told the BBC on Monday. "The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit. "He even spun the US's sustained pressure as a positive. "Because the US keeps targeting us and finding fault with us it has forced us to improve our products and services," he said.Although the US has been able to gain some traction in convincing allies to eschew Huawei's technology, on Sunday the Financial Times reported that the UK government has concluded it can mitigate the security risks.Ren made special mention of the UK in his interview. "We still trust in the UK, and we hope that the UK will trust us even more. We will invest even more in the UK. Because if the US doesn't trust us, then we will shift our investment from the US to the UK on an even bigger scale," he said.This defiance marks a change in Ren's rhetoric. Ren struck a much more conciliatory tone in January when he told reporters that he thought Donald Trump was a "great president."The arrest of Meng WanzhouIn the interview, Ren also spoke about the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou. "I object to what the US has done. This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable."Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP"There's no impact on Huawei's business due to Meng Wanzhou's loss of freedom. In fact, we're growing even faster. So they caught Meng Wanzhou, maybe they got the wrong person," he said."They may have thought if they've arrested her, Huawei would fall. But we didn't fall, we are still moving forward."NOW WATCH: We compared the $1,200 MacBook Air with the $500 Surface Go, and the results were a messSee Also:• Amazon will pay $0 in federal taxes this year - here's how the $793 billion company gets away with it• Behind on Jeff Bezos' beef with the National Enquirer?

'AI DEVELOPMENT REFLECTS NATIONAL DIFFERENCES:' DARDEN GLOBAL INNOVATORS ROUNDTABLE EXPLORES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ASIAStates News ServiceMarch 4, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1260 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia BodyThe following information was released by the University of Virginia's Darden Graduate School of Business Administration:By Erika HerzCompanies are struggling to make sense of the ramifications of artificial intelligence (AI) for their countries and for their firms as the technology rapidly transforms nearly every core business function. And national differences are evident in how these corporations implement AI solutions, according to senior business leaders from India. They gathered on 78 February in Bengaluru for the University of Virginia Darden School of Business' Global Innovators Roundtable, a series of seminar-style discussions hosted in the United States, Asia and Europe.The roundtable, sponsored by Darden's Batten Institute for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, brought together Indian executives from sectors including health care, financial services and technology to discuss how they are capitalizing upon and challenged by the AI revolution. The eight firms represented ranged from established corporates to AI-focused startups: Siemens, Roche Diagnostics, Titan Company Ltd., Nirvana Venture Advisors, Integra Connect, TotalStart Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Developers, Vida Promotions and eventValue.Professors Raj Venkatesan, and Dennis Yang facilitated the roundtable, opening the discussion with their views on the trajectory of AI in China, India, the United States and Europe through the lenses of their respective academic areas marketing and economics.As participants shared their experiences with AI products and services, the conversation centered on the strategies that enterprises and governments should deploy. Venkatesan and Yang noted that the technology raises more uncertainties than it resolves, both operationally and ethically, and that each country competes differently.According to Yang, "Geographical context is exceptionally relevant, whether you're based in India, China or the U.S. For example, in the U.S., entrepreneurs are the catalysts for AI, organically developing and securing funding for AI-enabled products and services. In China, however, a top-down strategy is underway, with the government aggressively investing in and moving forward an AI agenda. Conversely, in India successful technology company leaders, feeling that they struggle with inconsistent and changing government policies, are pushing to succeed in spite of them."Who Owns the Data?Data collection strategies, in particular, reflect the economic and cultural differences among AI superpowers, namely the U.S., China, India and Europe, as they establish frameworks relating to who owns the data and their degrees of freedom to use the vast amount collected.U.S. companies such as Google hold the information they gather from customers, which provides a competitive advantage for development of customized, AI-enabled products and services. The Chinese government invests heavily in AI infrastructure and state-owned companies, retaining much of the data generated from market and commercial activities. Meanwhile, Europe prioritizes consumer privacy rights, allowing those users dominion over the use of any data they provide. Ultimately, the choice of data owners and new technology beneficiaries whether companies, governments or consumers reflect each nation's prioritization among its stakeholders.While India's AI sector is nascent and investment may lag behind that of other economies, roundtable participants said the startup sector focused on AI is extremely vibrant. AI is a clear focus for both the private sector and the government, particularly given the technology's potential to positively impact the country's 1.3 billion citizens.Participants agreed that AI offers both challenges and opportunities for leaders of companies in the Indian marketplace and beyond."One of the critical issues to be resolved as AI becomes an integral part of the products and services consumers use is who has control of the data, and what should be the rights and responsibilities of citizens, corporations and governments?" said Rajan Mehra (MBA '93), co-founder and managing director of early stage technology venture adviser Nirvana Venture Advisors. "Above all, what can AI do, but also what should it not do?"Data: The Most Valuable AssetLooking more deeply at the implications of data collection capabilities, Venkatesan noted that in an AI-enabled world, companies are generally at a disadvantage relative to established social networks."We can think about an AI data platform as a network of consumers with various nodes, each a product or service provider," Venkatesan said. "The world has evolved such that the network whether Facebook, Instagram or any other social site allowing for exchange of information is the driver of value, not the individual node, or firm."He explained that even major consumer packaged goods companies are just one node in that network of users, making it difficult for them to gain insights about, or attention from, consumers. "It's incredibly difficult for marketers to increase market share or margin growth in the face of that," he said. "The companies are finding themselves at what could be considered AI 'moments of truth.'" In other words, they are figuring out how to transform the consumer-brand moments of truth with AI.Obtaining meaningful data from social networking sites or company websites can provide a gold mine of insights to aid in this process and avoid catastrophic product launch failures. "Customer lifecycles are changing. We need to know what solutions they will be looking for in the future in order to develop a product that will help them," said Sumant Sood, head of innovation for Titan Company Ltd.AI for Good: Solving Intractable Societal IssuesMehra encouraged fellow roundtable participants to consider how business leaders "can harness AI in order to serve India's large population and lift people's lives while making a profit."He and Ravi Madipadaga, head of research in digitalization and automation for Siemens, voiced the benefits of AI to achieve societal progress. "Only 650 ophthalmology retina specialists are available in India, primarily limited to metropolitan areas, to provide care to the 70 million individuals in the country needing eye care for diabetic retinopathy and related disorders," Madipadaga said. "Artificial intelligence will be essential to deliver care where humans simply can't. Companies such as Forus Health and Zeiss are already using it for screening and detecting issues in the retina. As the machines learn over time, they are even better able than a human to interpret a tissue sample."Further, just as AI can more easily meet the needs of growing populations, it offers the potential to fill gaps in the workforce for those that are shrinking. Jitendra Gupta (MBA '08), president of global operations at Integra Connect, noted that in Europe a declining population means that the labor force is contracting. AI may be helpful in fulfilling roles previously held by humans.About the University of Virginia Darden School of BusinessThe University of Virginia Darden School of Business delivers the world's best business education experience to prepare entrepreneurial, global and responsible leaders through its MBA, Ph.D. and Executive Education programs.

The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased staff-related costs, research and development investments and shipping and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were RMB572.5 million (US$83.3 million), compared to RMB385.5 million and RMB393.3 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB919.7 million (US$133.8 million) for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to RMB843.8 million and RMB290.4 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 34.0%, compared to 34.2% and 18.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company experienced higher operating losses compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled RMB1,697.7 million (US$246.9 million), compared to RMB1,596.3 million and RMB1,285.6 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled RMB2,359.6 million (US$343.2 million), compared to RMB2,258.8 million and RMB1,878.9 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB27.1 million (US$3.9 million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB56.1 million and a net foreign exchange loss of RMB159.1 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to foreign currency transactions and unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.93 and US$1.92, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.81 and US$1.80, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.42 and US$1.41, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017.

The increase in operating expenses in 2018 was primarily due to increased selling and marketing expenses, research and development investments and staff-related costs, as well as increased shipping and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for fiscal year 2018 were RMB1,670.4 million (US$242.9 million), compared to RMB1,182.7 million for fiscal year 2017.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB2,466.7 million (US$358.8 million) and RMB2,162.4 million for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate was 27.6% for fiscal year 2018, compared to 16.6% for fiscal year 2017.

The changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to foreign currency transactions and unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over these years.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$6.91 and US$6.87, respectively, for fiscal year 2018, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$11.83 and US$11.74, respectively, for fiscal year 2017.

Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.8755 on December 31, 2018 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on December 31, 2018, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective as of December 31, 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from e-commerce to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the results of NetEase's two e-commerce platforms,KaolaandYanxuan, which were established in January 2015 and April 2016, respectively. In addition, effective as of December 31, 2018, the Company renamed its "e-mail and others" segment to "innovative businesses and others" to better articulate the businesses included in this segment. The changes in segment reporting align with the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. The changes in segment presentation do not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services and innovative businesses and others.Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting PronouncementsOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" using the modified-retrospective transition approach and recorded a reduction of its deferred revenue of approximately RMB81.7 million and a net increase to its retained earnings of approximately RMB27.4 million (net of tax) as a result of estimating game point breakage. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on the Company's operating results for fiscal year 2018 and comparable periods. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01 "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities", and reclassified RMB38.2 million of accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company's available-for-sale equity securities that existed as of December 31, 2017 into retained earnings upon the adoption. In addition, the Company recorded net investment losses of RMB215.8 million related to the equity investments with readily determinable fair value for fiscal year 2018. Given that there were no material observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer, the Company did not record any changes to the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair value for fiscal year 2018.The Company also adopted ASU 2016-18 "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash" starting from the first quarter of 2018. Pursuant to the new guidance, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by an aggregate of RMB393.8 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to the amounts presented under previous guidance.Notes to Unaudited Financial InformationThe unaudited financial information disclosed in this press release is preliminary. The audit of the financial statements and related notes to be included in the Company's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2018 is still in progress. In addition, because an audit of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting in connection with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been completed, the Company makes no representation as to the effectiveness of those internal controls as of the end of fiscal year 2018.Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when the audit work is completed, which could result in significant differences between the Company's audited financial statements and this preliminary unaudited financial information. Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, February 20, 2019 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 9:00 a.m., Thursday, February 21, 2019).

These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase's affiliates will not be able to continue operatingMinecraft,World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®,Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls(TM), Heroes of the Storm®,Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its online game and e-commerce businesses; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret ShiNetEase,

generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, the Company included restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows.  Pursuant to the guidance, the Company retropsectively restated the statement of cash flows in the comparative periods.The accompanying notes are an integral part of this press

World stocks mixed amid fears for trade talks, Brexit hopesAssociated Press Financial WireJanuary 29, 2019 Tuesday 12:08 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 572 wordsByline: By ANNABELLE LIANG, Associated PressDateline: SINGAPORE BodySINGAPORE (AP) - World markets were mixed Tuesday amid concerns that U.S. criminal charges against China's Huawei could complicate trade talks, though European indexes were up on optimism over Brexit.KEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX was up 0.1 percent to 11,220 and France's CAC 40 added 0.7 percent to 4,920. Britain's FTSE 100 rebounded 1.3 percent to 6,834. Wall Street was set for small losses. The future contract for the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.2 percent and S&P 500 futures lost 0.1 percent.ASIA'S DAY: Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.2 percent to 27,531.68 and the Shanghai Composite index fell 0.1 percent to 2,594.25. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 0.1 percent higher at 20,664.64 after tumbling earlier in the day. The Kospi in South Korea gained 0.3 percent to 2,183.36. Australia's S&P ASX 200, reopening after a holiday, eased 0.5 percent to 5,874.20. Stocks fell in Taiwan and throughout Southeast Asia.HUAWEI CHARGES: China called on Washington on Tuesday to "stop the unreasonable crackdown" on Huawei, warning it would defend its companies after the U.S. escalated pressure on the tech giant by indicting it on charges of stealing technology and violating sanctions on Iran. That followed Monday's indictment by the Justice Department of Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on charges of stealing technology and violating sanctions on Iran. The Chinese government also urged the U.S. to drop its request to extradite Meng from Canada, where she was arrested on Dec. 1.US-CHINA TALKS: American and Chinese negotiators will sit down for two days of trade talks starting Wednesday in Washington. According to Bloomberg, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a briefing Monday that President Donald Trump is set to meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. While Trump's presence may indicate that the U.S. is serious about striking a deal, charges against Huawei could cast a cloud over negotiations going forward.ANALYST'S TAKE: Charges against Huawei "illustrate the risks attached to the U.S.-China relationship," DBS Group Research strategists Philip Wee and Eugene Leow said in a commentary. "The actions by the DOJ show that it would not be enough for China to buy more U.S. goods. America wants China to make structural reforms especially on its intellectual property practices."BREXIT PLAN: Lawmakers will debate and vote Tuesday on "Plan B" for Britain's impending exit from the European Union. They may also try to amend it and send Prime Minister Theresa May down a different path. Analysts note it is likely that lawmakers will also push for a delay to the March 29 Brexit day, giving them more time to find common ground. The current plan, which May concocted after talking to supporters and opposition politicians, looks a lot like the original that was rejected by 432 votes to 202 earlier this month. Britain is set to leave the bloc exactly two months from now, with or without a divorce deal.ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added 40 cents to $52.39 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It dropped $1.70 to settle at $51.99 per barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 49 cents to $60.42 per barrel.

It's all about Huawei. World's biggest mobile tech show gets startedCNN WireFebruary 24, 2019 Sunday 3:59 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 684 wordsByline: By Ivana Kottasová and Samuel Burke, CNN BusinessDateline: BARCELONA (CNN Business) BodyBARCELONA (CNN Business) --  Over the next four days, about 100,000 people in Barcelona are expected to traipse through the halls of Mobile World Congress, one of the tech industry's biggest events. All the biggest players in the world use it to showcase new products.One company really stands out this year: China's Huawei. Walking out of the Barcelona airport, there's a Huawei hospitality stand. The company's branding dots the city. The lanyards conference attendees wear around their necks are decorated with the Huawei name. There's a good reason everyone is focused on Huawei, one of the world's largest makers of telecom equipment. Huawei is a crucial part of China's efforts to advance superfast 5G wireless networks and today is caught in a life or death battle with the US government. The United States claims that Huawei poses a potential national security threat. Last month, US prosecutors revealed criminal charges against the company, alleging that Huawei stole trade secrets and worked to skirt US sanctions on Iran.Huawei strongly denies the claims and is trying hard to persuade the world to use its 5G technology and not cave to pressure from Washington. "This is not something that should be decided by politics," Huawei's chairman Guo Ping said on Sunday, ahead of the formal start of Mobile World Congress.Guo said he was hoping "independent sovereign states" will make "independent decisions based on their own understanding of the situation and will not just listen to someone else's order." The US government is trying to convince its allies to shun Huawei equipment, which it says could be used by the Chinese government for spying. The company vehemently denies that claim."Just because you are from a certain country doesn't mean your equipment is not secure," Guo said. He added that Huawei must abide by Chinese law and the laws of countries where it operates. "Huawei will never, and dare not, and cannot violate any regulations," he said.Vice President Mike Pence described Huawei as a "threat." Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned other countries that using Huawei would make it more difficult for the United States to "partner" with them.Europe is one of the battlegrounds, which is why the company isn't shying away from pouring resources into the event. The United Kingdom and Germany, two hugely attractive markets for Huawei, are reviewing whether to allow Huawei to be part of their future 5G networks. The countries are weighing the strong warnings coming from Washington against their business interests. Huawei is seen as a clear leader in 5G technology. Ditching it could mean falling behind on crucial innovation."Business communities in key swing markets for Huawei, such as the United Kingdom and Germany, appear increasingly concerned about the impact of an outright ban on broader commercial relations with Beijing," said Paul Triolo, the head of geo-technology at global research firm Eurasia Group.Mobile World Congress is organized by GSMA, a global lobby representing more than 750 network operators. GSMA has urged European policymakers not to ban Huawei and when deciding who will build Europe's 5G networks. It urged countries to take "a fact-based and risk-based approach" in a statement that the trade group representing the US wireless industry did not endorse.Guo, the Huawei chairman, alluded to the high stakes and referred to a tweet by President Donald Trump, who said he wanted the United States to have "5G, and even 6G" capability."He said the US needs faster networks and he has realized the US is behind and I think his message is clear and correct," Guo said. "Huawei has barely existed in the US networks," he added.Also on Sunday, Huawei unveiled its new device, the Mate X, which is both foldable and 5G capable --- touching on two of the big innovation themes that will dominate this week's events. Last week, Samsung launched its own foldable device, along with a 5G phone. Apple is rumored to have delayed the launch of a 5G iPhone until 2020. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Huawei Annual Sales Top USD100 Billion Despite US PressureLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsMarch 29, 2019 Friday 3:32 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 350 wordsBody Chinese telecom giant Huawei on Friday said its sales last year surged above USD100 billion, despite pressure from the US government.Huawei's global sales in 2018 reached CNY721.2 billion, about USD105 billion, up 20% from the previous year.Net profit jumped 25% on a year before to CNY59.3 billion, the company said in its annual report.Revenue was driven by consumer and enterprise sales, both of which saw double-digit growth. However, revenue from telecom carriers fell slightly, by 1.3% year on year, reflecting the US government's pressure on other countries to not develop their 5G networks with Huawei for security reasons. The US accuses Huawei of stealing trade secrets, attempting to breach Iran sanctions and facilitating the Chinese government's spying, though it has not shown evidence to back the spying accusation.Huawei this month sued the US government over its ban on government agencies from contracting with Huawei or other companies that use its equipment.Meanwhile, in Canada, a court is considering a request from the US for the extradition of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the company's founder, Ren Zhengfei.Meng is accused of bank and wire fraud in connection with possible violations of US sanctions against Iran. Guo Ping, Huawei's rotating chairman, said in the annual report that the company will do everything it can to "shake off outside distractions.""Cyber security and user privacy protection are at the absolute top of our agenda," Guo said, adding that companies and countries that choose to work with Huawei will have competitive advantages.The US has pressed its European allies to not contract with Huawei, whose networking equipment is generally cheaper than that of US companies, saying it could endanger their defence ties.Tensions around Huawei as well as Meng's arrest have put a strain on relations between China, Canada and the US in the midst of a months-long trade war between Washington and Beijing.A high-level US trade team is currently in Beijing to negotiate a possible end to the trade war.By Simina Mistreanu, dpaLoad-Date: March 30, 2019End of Document

Kandi Signs Framework Agreement with Zhejiang Ruibo to Serve as the Primary Vehicle Provider of 300,000 Electric Vehicles Within 5 YearsGlobeNewswireJanuary 22, 2019 Tuesday 5:33 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS CONTRACTS; COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 1032 wordsBodyJINHUA, China, Jan.  22, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (the "Company," "we" or "Kandi") (NASDAQ GS: KNDI), announced today that Kandi Electric Vehicles Co., Ltd. (the "JV Company", an equally held joint venture by Kandi Vehicles and Geely Group, Ltd.) led the efforts in organizing a five-year online ride-sharing service alliance in Hangzhou on January 13, 2019 (the "Online Ride-sharing Service Alliance").  The Online Ride-sharing Alliance was initiated by Zhejiang Ruibo New Energy Vehicle Service Company Ltd. ("Zhejiang Ruibo"). Its goal is to provide 300,000 government-accredited vehicles within five years. Participating companies from more than ten cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Suzhou, Guangzhou, and Xiamen jointly signed the alliance agreement. On January 18, 2019, the JV Company signed a Framework Agreement with Zhejiang Ruibo to provide 300,000 government-accredited vehicles for the ride-sharing service within five years as the primary vehicle supplier.Mr. Hu Xiaoming, Chairman of Kandi Electric Vehicle Group, commented, "The time-sharing micro public transportation (MPT) project innovated by Kandi in 2013 was a big hit nationwide. However, because of the surge in internet users and the increasing popularity of ride-sharing services, time-sharing micro public transportation services have been gradually evolving and upgrading to compete with newer online ride-sharing services. Currently, there are more than 3 million vehicles operated for online ride-sharing services, 90% of which are not government-accredited. According to the Chinese government's related regulations, drivers of online ride-sharing services and their vehicles must have two government-approved documents   an online ride-sharing driver's license and a reserved transport permit. Presently, the vast majority of vehicles used for online ride-sharing are privately owned by drivers as their own personal assets. If the privately-owned vehicles are to be converted into reserved passenger vehicles, the insurance for one vehicle would increase by more than RMB 10,000 (approximately USD 1470). Additionally, the vehicles must be totaled after a designated period of use, which means that the used vehicles then become less valuable. Therefore, most household vehicle owners are reluctant to convert privately owned vehicles into operating vehicles for online ride-sharing services, resulting in over 90% of vehicles in operation not being government-accredited.""The related state department is aiming to impose restrictions on car-sharing operations to legalize and standardize the industry. We believe that 2019 will be the perfect time to rectify the use of non-government-accredited ride-sharing vehicles, as well as to mark the entry point for pure electric vehicles being officially introduced to the ride-sharing market. Given Kandi's specialty in producing quick-change batteries for pure electric vehicles, getting into the online ride-sharing market would have inherent advantages for the Company. To seize the opportunity of the fast-growing online ride-sharing market, we believe our involvement in organizing the online ride-sharing alliance over five-year arrangement to provide 300,000 government-accredited vehicles is a meaningful milestone," concluded Mr. Hu.About Kandi Technologies Group, Inc.Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (KNDI), headquartered in Jinhua Economic Development Zone, Zhejiang Province, is engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, and sales of various vehicular products. Kandi conducts its primary business operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Zhejiang Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd. ("Kandi Vehicles"), SC Autosports, LLC, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Kandi Vehicles, and Kandi Electric Vehicles Group Co., Ltd. (the "JV Company"). Kandi Vehicles has established itself as one of China's leading manufacturers of pure electric vehicle parts and off-road vehicles.In 2013, Kandi Vehicles and Geely Group, China's leading automaker, jointly invested in the establishment of the JV Company in order to develop, manufacture and sell pure electric vehicle ("EV") products. As of 2018, each party has invested RMB 1.045 billion in the JV Company, for a total investment of RMB 2.09 billion with each party holding a 50% stake in the JV Company. The JV Company has established itself as one of the driving forces in the development and the manufacturing of pure EV products in China.More information about KNDI is available on the Company's corporate website at http://www.kandivehicle.com.

The company's phones are essentially locked out of the US market, as it suspects that the company could be a backdoor for the Chinese government. More recently, the US has been aggressively lobbying its allies to reject Huawei's 5G network plans.The US has ratcheted up the pressure on Huawei in recent months against the backdrop of its trade war with China.

Pompeo "said he was 'hopeful' that the Europeans would move in the US direction on using Huawei equipment." Said Pompeo, "I think we've made progress and I know that we are going to continue to push. ... When you have telecommunications that are deeply connected to state-owned enterprises connected to China, we don't see there is a technical mitigation risk that is possible."However, Reuters (3/26, Weber, Jiang) reports separately that Huawei's chairman says "the US campaign...is having little impact on the company's sales and it is unlikely many countries will follow the United States in banning Huawei from building next-generation mobile networks." Reuters notes that while "Australia has banned Huawei from 5G networks over security concerns, European Union countries such as Germany and France have indicated they are likely to ignore the US call to shut out the telecoms giant." Reuters says Huawei "does not expect the United States to intensify its attack on the company by barring sales of US components to Huawei, a move that almost put its compatriot ZTE Corp out of business last year before" President Trump "lifted the ban."US Orders Chinese Company To Sell Grindr App.The Wall Street Journal (3/27, A1, Wells, O'Keeffe, Subscription Publication, 7.24M) reports US national-security officials have ordered a Chinese company to sell gay-dating app Grindr.

Huawei founder denies spying claims, praises TrumpUPIJanuary 15, 2019 Tuesday 1:44 PM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 309 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Dec. 31 BodyThe founder of Huawei Technologies denied for the first time on Tuesday the company has been assisting the Chinese government to spy on the West.Ren Zhengfei, the Chinese billionaire who is also father of Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, being held in Canada, said there is no "regular contact" between the firm and Beijing, Bloomberg reported."I love my country, I support the Communist Party. But I will not do anything to harm the world," Ren said in a briefing with foreign correspondents. "I don't see a close connection between my personal political beliefs and the businesses of Huawei."Ren also appeared to be appeasing the U.S. government as his daughter faces extradition to the United States on charges of helping banks avoid U.S. Iran sanctions.The Chinese executive praised President  for his pro-business policies, according to Bloomberg."Trump is a great president," Ren said. "He dares to massively cut taxes, which will benefit business. But you have to treat well the companies and countries so that they are willing to invest in the U.S. and the government will be able to collect enough tax."Ren also downplayed Huawei's role, calling his company a "sesame seed in the trade conflict between China and the United States." He then forecast the firm's revenue would grow to $125 billion in 2019, up from $100 billion in 2018.Huawei has been targeted in Canada and most recently in Poland.Sky News reported Monday Warsaw is looking into a Huawei product ban and arrested two men on Friday. At least one of the men is being held on suspicion of espionage.A NATO official told Sky News the alliance takes cybersecurity very seriously."We continue to boost our cyber defenses and support allies as they strengthen their national cyber defenses. Allies also consult regularly on cyber challenges and threats," the official said.Load-Date: January 16, 2019End of Document

INTERVIEW: 'I HAVE NEVER CRIED SO MUCH IN MY LIFE'States News ServiceMarch 5, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1026 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Abdurahman is an ethnic Uyghur father of three who fled oppressive policies in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) for Turkey in October 2013, followed by his wife, Helime, four months later. After Helime gave birth to the couple's third child, she returned with all three to her home in the XUAR's Aksu (in Chinese, Akesu) prefecture in August 2016, seeking help with childcare from her parents. After losing touch with his family members, he learned that authorities had sentenced Helime to prison.Since then, dozens of members of his extended family have been detained and he is unsure of what became of his children. His family members are believed to be among the estimated 1.1 million Uyghurs held in "political re-education camps" throughout the XUAR since April 2017 after being accused by authorities of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas. The children of detained parents are regularly brought for care to schools, nurseries or orphanages, where sources say the facilities are seriously overcrowded and in terrible condition.Recently, a video portraying a Uyghur child being quizzed on propaganda points about the Chinese "fatherland" in Mandarin Chinese surfaced on social media and, upon viewing it, Abdurahman immediately recognized the boy as his four-year-old son Abduleziz. He recently spoke to RFA's Uyghur Service about the difficulties he has endured living in exile without knowing what has become of his family. RFA: How did you recognise him? What is the source of the video? Abdurahman: There is a video sharing platform called DouyinI saw the video of my son posted there. When I saw him my heart jumped. I recognized him, but I wasn't too sure, so I compared his earlier photos that I had and it was very clear that he was my son. I couldn't control my tears. He was born from two Uyghurs, but I fear that he cannot speak our language and is being fed pork, against our Muslim traditions ... My biggest fear is that if I ever meet him again in my lifetime, he will have been assimilated as Chinese, and the Chinese government will have taught him that I am his enemy. Will I ever have an opportunity to meet him again in our homeland and hear him call me dad?Since the day he was born, he was very energetic and happy. He never cried much, even at an early age. Among my three children, he was the only one born when I was present. When he stopped breastfeeding, I looked after him for 15 days, isolating him from his mother to wean him. I was very close to him and it has been extremely difficult for me to cope with being separated from my children. When I saw him in the video, my emotions were too overwhelming and painful. I have never cried so much in my life, even when I faced extreme difficulties in the past. RFA: Did you recognise him immediately? Abdurahman: Yes. I have a lot of his photos. He has an older sister and a younger sister, but I haven't heard any news about them. RFA: And what about your wife? Abdurahman: I learned that my wife was given a 10-year prison sentence. After my wife gave birth to our youngest daughter, her parents asked them to return home so they could help her look after the children, especially the newborn. They travelled to our hometown in Aksu in August 2016. Later I heard that they arrested my wife in November [that year]. RFA: Don't you have any contact with your parents or your wife's family? Abdurahman: No. I don't know if they are in prison or a re-education camp, or whether they are dead or alive. RFA: You only know about your wife being imprisoned, is that right? Abdurahman: Yes, but I am also aware that my younger sister and my elder sister's husband were imprisoned. Other family membersRFA: Who else is living at your home in Aksu? Abdurahman: My father Tohti Emet, my mother Aynurhan Qasim, and my sisters. My elder brothers had their own houses and shared the same gardens and orchard, so they were often at the house. RFA: There are none of them left there though, is that right? Abdurahman: No, no one. RFA: How many grandchildren were living in that house? Abdurahman: My youngest sister had three children. My two brothers had two children. Including my three children, there were eight of them. RFA: And there is no news about all eight children, is that right? Abdurahman: Yes. The eldest is 12 and the youngest is two. I don't know where they have been taken, and there is no news about whether they are dead or alive.My wife was arrested immediately after arriving in the country. I learned that she was released two months later. She had been beaten severely. It cost the family more than 200,000 yuan (U.S. $29,820) to get her out of detention. She received medical treatment immediately after being released, but as soon as her health improved, she was once more taken away, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. I learned this from her cousin in November 2016.My younger sister was married in July 2016. Two months after her marriage, in September, she was detained and sentenced to three years in prison because she had visited Turkey.I fear that they have locked up my father as well. The reason I say this is because my family is a very devoted religious family. My father prayed five times a day and never missed his religious duty. Also, he is a very knowledgeable and educated man. In 2013 and 2014 he helped many young people in our town to travel abroad. For all these reasons, I worry whether they have harmed him.I have tried to contact members of my family, but all the numbers I have rung connect to an automated message that says the numbers do not exist. We are five siblings, the oldest aged 35 and the youngest aged 24, but none of us are able to be with our parents ... My wish is to return to my country and see them at least once while they are still alive. I am in complete shock and confused. I don't know where to seek help and support. There are too many people here suffering like me in limbohelpless and not knowing what to do. Reported by Gulchehra Hoja for RFA's Uyghur Service.

THE RACE TO RESPONSIBLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEStates News ServiceFebruary 20, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 866 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Illinois Rep. Daniel Lipinski:By Congressman Dan LipinskiThe HillChances are youve heard of artificial intelligence, which has found widespread adoption in our popular culture. Generally speaking, AI is a set of computer algorithms that can learn to make decisions without human intervention. Autocorrect on our smartphones? Thats AI, though I think we can all agree there is some room for improvement in that arena. Its fun to ponder what technological wizardry AI will offer future generations. Where it becomes daunting, however, is when we consider its long-term global implications and the structure necessary to harness its development.How will AI improve our lives next? That depends. Right now, we are in a race to build effective AI that can be developed and used here in America. But its not a sprint or a 5k, its more like a marathon relay race on an uncharted course. To win this race, we need a team and a plan. What do we get if we win? We get to use AI that is developed consistent with our American values, and we can set the rules of the road for its use. What happens if another team wins? The AI-enabled technology we use will be developed offshore, threatening American jobs in this burgeoning field and leading to applications that skew from our norms. We may find ourselves using algorithms that decide who gets a loan based on their cellphones battery-charging history. Thats already happening in China, and while it may be standard practice there, it certainly feels like an invasion of privacy to me. The use of AI can be highly influenced by the values of the society that creates it.The good news is that in the U.S., we already have some of the best scientists and engineers in the world working feverishly to come up with better algorithms to power AI devices. Those of us who experienced computer translation in its infancy recall that it often produced hilarious results; these days its pretty accurate, thanks to American AI innovation.Weve got a great team, but we dont yet have a plan. To navigate this uncharted relay race, we need to be coordinated and strategic about who is doing what, and when, with a commitment of the necessary resources. This is where America currently lags. Our counterparts in China have announced their vision to use AI pervasively in their society, making extensive use of video recording and other personal data in public and not-so-public spaces, with Chinese researchers working overtime to put AI-enabled technology in the hands of the Chinese government and consumers. In the UK, they are strategically cultivating a workforce to create and use AI-enabled devices. Here in the U.S., we dont have a current strategic plan for AI research and development to get us to where we want to be, and without such a plan we dont have much hope to prevail.The recently-announced executive order directing agencies to prioritize AIs development is a testament to the need, but it doesnt provide resources or a plan to accomplish any goals.Toward that end, my office has been working for months now to learn about the needs of our American AI research community, interviewing a wide variety of stakeholders including high-level experts at our National Laboratories and agencies, teachers who are looking out for their students future careers, workers who are now using AI in their jobs, and experts from large and small private sector companies who provide cloud computing resources. Weve listened to what they had to say and carefully crafted the Growing Artificial Intelligence Through Research (GrAITR) Act, which I will introduce in the House of Representatives soon. This will establish a strategic plan to invest $1.6 billion over 10 years in our nations AI research, development, and education. This bill will ensure coordination of AI-related science and technology across federal government agencies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will create standards to evaluate the algorithms behind AI-enabled technology, charting the course toward responsible AI. The Department of Energy, with its world-class National Laboratories, will build next-generation computing systems to help AI learn faster from ever-larger datasets, paving the way for public-private partnerships to translate new AI discoveries into products that Americans can use every day. The National Science Foundation (NSF) will fund multidisciplinary research centers to study the basic science of AI and its effects on our society. The NSF will also develop AI education programs at both large flagship universities and smaller regional institutions for students young and old at every career stage, including retirees. This part is very important, to make sure that everyone is prepared for our AI-enhanced future.I want the benefits of AI to be shared by all Americans, not just a privileged few. As AI becomes more integrated into our everyday life, many American workers and consumers will be assisted by it, freeing us from our more tedious tasks and allowing us to do what we do best think and make decisions.Lipinski is a senior member of the Science Research and Technology Subcommittee.Load-Date: February 20, 2019End of Document

Companies demand participation in QuerétaroCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 5, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 616 wordsBody Querétaro, Qro. Companies in the Information and Communication Technologies sector demand a greater participation in the purchases of products with scientific development from the government entities of the state.  The president of the IT Vortex, Queretaro information technology cluster, Jorge Alfredo Buitrón Arriola, explained that local firms have the capacity to provide both products and technological services to the state government.  However, he said, they have opted for their suppliers to be foreign and even foreign firms.  The businessman said that they even have higher quality than the technology that the government acquires abroad.  "The important request is for the Querétaro government to be more aware of taking into account what they have at home; it means that we have companies capable of providing products and services at a better and higher level than those that are buying abroad. Buying in China and elsewhere is not giving rise to Vortex and its companies to participate to boost local economic development, "said Buitrón Arriola.  He noted that the incorporation of local companies will pay to boost the economic development of this sector in the entity.  Cluster partners, he explained, have sought rapprochement with public authorities, in order to offer their services, but these are not usually considered as suppliers.  "There were complaints from some (cluster partners), who come and never let them in. (Governing bodies) are going for the cheapest, the acquisitions people take the road and no longer gave local companies the opportunity, "he said.  Cybersecurity, he said, and especially the systems implemented by state governments are one of the trends in the information technology market and at the same time they are one of the services that local firms could offer to the public sector.  The president of Vortex added that for the installation of the so-called C4 (Center for Communication, Computing, Control and Command), they do not usually consult the technology companies that are installed in the state.  Buitrón Arriola stressed that last year, in coordination with the Chinese government, the latest state-of-the-art trail technology was raised at the request of public security; however, there was no interest in implementing these schemes.  Linking schemes  The secretary of the cluster, Miguel Ángel Carapia González, stressed that it is necessary to advance in the digital transformation from the governing bodies, so that from the cluster technologies have been developed that can be implemented in the government's work.  Therefore, he commented, systems have been created to speed up the link between the citizen and the government through more compliant schemes.  "We are making the government approach the citizen through technology, we no longer want the citizen to go to the municipality, to the government facilities, but rather that we take the government office to a cell phone of each citizen and that through there they can do their paperwork or pay, "explained Carapia González.  Initiatives  Likewise, IT sector industrialists also urged greater participation of cluster companies in initiatives such as the State Program for the Development of Technology and Innovation (Pedeti).  According to the Ministry of Sustainable Development, in 2018, 30 million pesos were disbursed through the Pedeti, a resource with which 30projects presented by companies, entrepreneurs, research centers and universities.  In this context, the Vortex IT has held meetings with local and federal legislators, in which it has proposed making adjustments to the local acquisitions law, so that companies can participate in government purchases. Load-Date: March 6, 2019End of Document

Huawei is under siege, and now it's going on the offensiveCNN WireMarch 7, 2019 Thursday 10:36 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 900 wordsByline: By Charles Riley and Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  China's Huawei shunned the spotlight as it grew to become one of the world's top tech companies. Now it's going on the offensive to counter a US campaign aimed at curbing its business.Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei has given a series of rare interviews in recent weeks, and Huawei executives were out in force to defend the company at Mobile World Congress. The company has taken out a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal. In New Zealand, where the government has blocked its top telecom firm from using Huawei equipment in its 5G mobile network, Huawei is running ads that compare 5G without Huawei to "life without rugby."But the most dramatic sign of the strategy shift came Thursday, when Huawei invited journalists to its campus in Shenzhen, brought out a team of top executives, and announced it was suing the US government over a law that bans federal agencies from buying its products."The US Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products," said Huawei Deputy Chairman Guo Ping. "We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort."The decision to file suit shows how hard Huawei is willing to punch back against US efforts to convince other countries that using the telecom company's equipment in 5G networks is a threat to national security."Huawei has no downside in taking on the United States," said Duncan Clark, an expert on China's tech sector and the author of "Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built.""They've precious little to lose in the US market," he said of Huawei. "The US government saw to that by sealing off their (already very protected) market. But they have a lot to lose in Europe and other developed markets."In those places, Huawei is setting up "transparency centers" that allow customers to run security tests on its products. A new hub opened in Brussels this week.The old HuaweiIt's hard to imagine the Huawei of old taking such an aggressive line. William Plummer, who spent eight years working on government and media relations for Huawei, wrote in a book published last year that Huawei "rarely spoke to the media and had negligible interaction with government."The lack of engagement continued even after US lawmakers warned in 2012 that Huawei products "could undermine core US national security interests." The company denied that was the case, but its executives seldom made the argument in public.Plummer wrote in his book that by not challenging the narrative, Huawei "had unknowingly allowed fear, uncertainty and doubt to become fact.""The media were genuinely feared, and there seemed to be a real concern that jobs would be lost and heads would roll if even the slightest misstatements were made," he said of the company's culture. What's changedWashington has for years been suspicious that the Chinese government could use Huawei equipment to spy on other nations, without providing specific evidence. Huawei has denied the accusations.But pressure on the world's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment has increased dramatically in recent months.US prosecutors have filed criminal charges against Huawei in Washington state and New York. Huawei pleaded not guilty in Seattle last week to charges that it tried to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.The company's arraignment in Brooklyn on charges that it worked to skirt US sanctions on Iran is scheduled for later this month. Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, has also been charged in that case. She was arrested in Canada in December and faces extradition to the United States. Meng and Huawei have denied the charges.Much is at risk: Germany and the United Kingdom are deciding which kinds of restrictions to impose on Huawei equipment. Australia has already banned the company from providing technology for its 5G networks.The intensity of the US campaign combined with the legal cases has provoked a different kind of response from Huawei. Ren spoke to foreign media for the first time in three years in January, saying he loved China and supported the Communist Party but had never been asked to share "improper information" about Huawei's partners.Guo, the company's deputy chairman, went further on Thursday, accusing American officials of hypocrisy and claiming the United States "has hacked our servers and stolen our emails and the source code." Plummer said in an email that Huawei "is at long last standing up for itself against unsubstantiated allegations." "There is a solid global understanding that Huawei gear is not only leading the industry, but is essential to the future of 5G," he said. "It seems that while there was initial acceptance of the US warnings of 'threats,' that as the campaign has worn on, there is more and more skepticism. And this has emboldened Huawei yet further."While analysts think the pushback from Huawei is designed to help preserve its access to lucrative markets in Europe and beyond, the company says it's not giving up on the United States."We have to understand the risk to this country, and to make this country safer," Huawei's chief US security officer Andy Purdy told CNN Business last week.

Huawei sales director arrested in Poland on espionage chargesFierceWirelessJanuary 14, 2019 Monday 12:06 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 423 wordsByline: Matt KapkoBodyA director of sales for Huawei has been arrested in Poland and accused of spying on behalf of China, according to Poland's secret services. The Chinese technology giant, which is desperately trying to distance itself from reports of espionage and other illicit business practices, swiftly fired Wang Weijing before he entered a plea,            Bloomberg reports.Wang, who was responsible for selling Huawei equipment to public agencies in Poland, was detained along with a former high-ranking official with Poland's Internal Security Agency for allegedly conducting espionage against Poland. Huawei has denied any involvement with Wang's alleged activities.The pair will be placed under arrest for three months and could be jailed for up to 10 years, according to a statement released by Stanislaw Zaryn, spokesperson for the chief of Poland's secret services.RELATED:With jailed CFO, Huawei's future darkensRegardless of the outcome with Wang's detention in Poland, the incident reinforces widening fears about Huawei's close ties to the Chinese government and deepens skepticism of the company's operations. The arrest comes a little more than a month after Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canadaupon request from U.S. officialsfor allegedly using the global banking system to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.Earlier this month, Reuters reported President Donald Trump is considering an executive order that would bar U.S. companies from using equipment made by Huawei and ZTE. The latest incident in Poland could also expand Huawei's problems to Europe, a key market for the company, as more governments scrutinize Huawei's practices.RELATED:Huawei enters 2019 with high expectations, daunting challenges in the U.S.Huawei has repeatedly denied accusations of wrongdoing, but an air of suspicion has followed the company for more than a decade and the latest arrests will bolster its critics. Most attempts to unravel Huawei's involvement in wireless networks will require a complete dismantling of network infrastructure and likely delay the advancement of wireless services in the countries it serves.Huawei is playing a leading role in 5G deployments around the globe. At the beginning of the year, the company said it hadsigned 26 commercial contracts for 5G with global carriers and has already shipped more than 10,000 5G base stations to markets around the world. Huawei has customers in more than 170 countries and was expected to end 2018 with $108.5 billion in total sales, making it the largest Chinese company many times over.Load-Date: January 18, 2019End of Document

Risen Energy's steadfast expansion to the global solar marketPR NewswireJanuary 11, 2019 Friday 7:33 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 412 wordsDateline: NINGBO, China, Jan. 11, 2019 BodyPR Newswire Brazilian market research firm Greener recently released the results of a report on the strategic markets for solar PV power generation during the second half of 2018. Over a one-month period, Greener conducted an extensive survey of PV solution providers of all sizes around the world, with 768 system integrators responding.One item of note within the report was that Chinese solar-panel maker Risen Energy was the integrator that came in third in terms of penetration in the Brazilian market, with a 24.6% score as an index of market reach within the country. The report further pointed out that module quality is the major consideration during a customer's selection process of a brand with 9.79% of Brazilian suppliers viewing Risen Energy as their preferred supplier. In other positive news, Risen Energy inked a 50MW module supply contract with Vietnamese firm PNPHANOI on January 7, in line with and with the support of the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road initiative and the Vietnamese government's Two Corridors and One Economic Circle plan. Risen Energy will provide PNPHANOI with 50 MW modules for the Long Thanh 1 Solar Power Plant project.Risen Energy is just one of the many Chinese PV solution makers that have been paying increasing attention to expansion outside of their home market for years. The fast-growing South American market, with Brazil serving as a representative example, is an area with huge potential, coupled with, it goes without saying, fierce competition. Zhao Zelin, vice president of sales at Risen Energy, said: "To get a better understanding of the expectations of the Brazilian market, in August 2018, we brought a collection of high-precision modules including 72 polycrystalline, 72 monocrystalline PERC and 72 off-grid monocrystalline PERC modules to the 5th Enersolar + Brasil - International Fair of Technologies for Solar Energy and showcased them to customers. We have enhanced our brand awareness via a series of promotional events and campaigns, paving a solid foundation for subsequent partnerships. Based on a shipment target of over 100MW to Brazil for 2018 and orders on hand, we aim to provide the PV facilities across the country with more than 260 MW of modules this year, with an anticipated market share in the 15-20 percent range." View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/risen-energys-steadfast-expansion-to-the-global-solar-market-300776803.htmlSOURCE Risen Energy Co., LtdCONTACT: Tina Feng, +86-13736192549Load-Date: January 12, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 25 of 359Survey: China factory activity sinks to 3-year low  Page 27 of 359Huawei fires sales manager who Poland charged with spying  Page 29 of 359Huawei fires sales manager who Poland charged with spying  Page 32 of 359US warns Germany that using Huawei tech will come at a cost  Page 35 of 359US warns Germany that using Huawei tech will come at a cost  Page 45 of 359THE LOWY INSTITUTE INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT Q AND A  Page 47 of 359Germany says Huawei must provide assurances on data  Page 49 of 359KING PRESSES TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ON THREATS FACING UNITED STATES  Page 51 of 359Sen.
