# Investigating Media's Coverage of China
### My final project for COMM313 _Computational Text Analysis for Communication Research_ (Spring 21)


Hello! My name is Vivienne Chen and this is my final project for the Spring 2021 semester of COMM313: Computations Txt Analysis. I decided to do my project on the evaluation of American media coverage on China as a result of the increase of anti-Asian hate crimes. While the pandemic has played a huge role in these attacks, it is not the pandemic alone that has contributed to the negative sentiments Americans feel towards Asians/Asian Americans (more specifically Chinese Americans).
