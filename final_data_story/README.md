## Blog post of your data story for COMM313 Final Project

* This folder contains the files of the output for all my data analyses. 
    * An engaging data blog/op-ed that stands alone (i.e. it doesn't require the reader to look over all your analysis notebooks).


* `COMM313_final` - the blog/op-ed post that compiles my analyses and narrative

* photos - the folder that has all of the photos used in the blog post (notebook)
